<PRE>Gaming is definitely getting much better on the Mac. All Macs have 
decent graphics cards now (yes, the iMac's graphics card IS decent). 
Consumer PCs come with lower-end graphics cards too, it's just that you 
can upgrade them. If you need to be able to upgrade it, you can get a 
G5 tower (the single 1.8 isn't that expensive), but the iMac's GeForce 
5200 should be fine for most average gamers for a good while. I have 
heard very few complaints about the performance of recent games for the 
Mac; most Mac game developers, such as Aspyr and Macsoft develop their 
games with Apple's low-end systems in mind. With UT 2004, I didn't get 
as dramatic a performance boost as I thought I would when I upgraded 
from a Radeon 9000 (64 MB VRAM) to a 9800 (128 MB VRAM), and benchmarks 
comparing a dual 2 GHz tower with a GF 5200 with 64 megs of VRAM and a 
dual 2.5 GHz with a 9600 XT with 128 haven't shown that dramatic an 
improvement. I'm guessing this is because Macsoft really optimized UT 
for Apple's low-end systems, so we don't see that much of a performance 
improvement in higher-end systems.

Anyway, much more games are coming out for the Mac than before. We got 
UT 2004, Battlefield 1942 (FINALLY), Homeworld 2, and most other big PC 
games. DOOM 3 has been officially announced by Aspyr, and I'm sure 
Half-Life 2 will come before too long (probably either Aspyr or Macsoft 
will do it). The game situation on the Mac has definitely gotten a lot 
better in the past few years and continues to rapidly improve.
