I think it is a vicious circle. Why are there no games for the mac? Cuz
the hardware is behind the times (that is, there is no decent gaming
hardware). Why is there no decent gaming hardware? Because there aren't
any games.

I don't want to see a 'gaming iMac'. I just want an iMac that I can update
the video card to something top of the line this year. In 2 years, it will
probably be left in the dust, but I don't care so much about 2 years from
now.

I realize that there are more PC games. If I wanted to play them, I would
buy a PC. I want to play the games that exist on my mac at the best
quality I can. I'd love to play Halo with all the details on full. I can't
with my GeForce IIMX. But I don't want to go buy a PC just to do it
either.

I would have bought an iMac G5 by now if the video card was better. Not
because I want it only for gaming, but because I want it to be capable of
gaming.

Allan
