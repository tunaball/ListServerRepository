&gt;<i> However, the gamer in me would like to see a special iMac Gamer 
</I>&gt;<i> edition.  I doubt this would ever happen.  Maybe someone should start 
</I>&gt;<i> a grass roots movement and petition Apple to make an iMac special 
</I>&gt;<i> edition for Gaming.  However, this would take a lot of signatures and 
</I>&gt;<i> if people didn't buy the machine then it would probably never happen 
</I>&gt;<i> again.  I'm guessing that Apple would go back to putting in video 
</I>&gt;<i> cards that are acceptable for gaming in the iMacs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you guys think Apple should put in a gaming iMac G5 and then 
</I>&gt;<i> what do you think they should charge?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to see your answers.  Think about it this way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before you answer think of the following.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you put a NVIDIA 6800 Ultra in the machine for gaming then you 
</I>&gt;<i> better be willing to pay 500 dollars more for a 20 inch iMac.  Are you 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to pay 2300 dollars for it?  How many people would pay (think 
</I>&gt;<i> parents here) 2300 vs 1800 for the gaming iMac?
</I>
Although it would be cool to see a special iMac Gamer edition w/ 6800 
Ultra or X800Pro I don't think this will be a success. Because the real 
hardcore gamers buy a PC/built a PC themselves and get themselves a 
fast and expensive video card.
Why the PC? Well still a lot of games aren't being released for the 
Mac, that used to be so in the past, and that will continue, I mean you 
wanna play Halflife 2 or Need for Speed Underground 2 right now? Not on 
the Mac... Even Bungie went for the big money and released Halo for the 
XBox first, the Mac and PC version were released a year later IIRC 
(which I regret BTW).
Don't get me wrong, the first computer I owned was a Mac and I still 
have several I use such as my G3 (server) and my clamshell iBook, and a 
still do pre-press on a daily bases on a Mac, but a few years ago I 
switched to a PC for gaming. Why? Well I'm a harcore gamer as they say 
and to play all the latest FPS and race sims I need a PC since I can't 
play them on the Mac.
I think this is why a special iMac Gamer edition won't be a success.

Marc
