<PRE>Oh Dear! That's not good news at all!  I was going to wait till after 
XMas anyway for price drops and good deals. but the suggestion to wait 
till after MWSF is excellent.

Since I don't consider myself as a real hard core gamer but rather one 
who enjoys single player FPS's and strategy games I'm hoping that the 
&quot;consumer grade&quot; iMAC would probably be all right. Certainly it's got 
to be better than my current semi-antique AGP/400 with an 8500 video 
card. The G5 iMAC looks as if it will solve my need for improved 
portability but yet preserve most of my game playing ability. I just 
don't want to give up too much of future playability. Is that a 
reasonable assumption?

Thanks for your suggestion
John
