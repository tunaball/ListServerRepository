<PRE>I didn't know you were on the gaming list too!  I guess I never really made
the connection.

I'm not sure what I think about the mouse.  I've been switching between it
and the new Kensington with the middle scroll pad.

Sometime I think that the MS wireless intellexplorer is a little harder to
control in SOF.  But I'm wondering if that is because of the sensitivity in
the game or OS X or the mouse.

Right now I don't have a lot of time to fool around with it.  I've been
running about 40 to 60 auctions on ebay the whole month.  Tonight I've
shipped 14 packages and I've been sitting in here since 5:00 pm and I'm
still not done yet.

I have to list some Macintosh accessories for a client.

If anyone wants to look at some great used products I've got a graphics
artist that has given me his Ti book 400 which is listed and a Indigo Blue
iMac DV+.  Also an external 20 Gig Firewire drive with 18 Gigs of MP3's and
there were a couple of games but they sold quick.

One game that I have listed is called V for victory.  It is a WWII game and
runs on the old color macs like the Mac II series.  It also works on the
plus.  A Vintage game and it's in the original box.  I'd never heard of it
before but when it came out I was too busy being a college student.

To top it off I relisted my CH Products Pro Throttle.  The person who tried
to buy it wound up being a PC user and stiffed me when they found out it was
for a Mac.  It said Mac right in the title of the listing.

To make it even better there is a Thrustmaster Throttle and Flightstick
listed that belonged to the Graphics artist that I aforementioned.  It too
has been hardly used.  Both sets of controllers are for ADB devices.

If anyone wants to look at the auctions my ebay screen name is: iconsult1

Just do a search by seller and enter it in.

I'm hoping to get back to gaming after Christmas!
