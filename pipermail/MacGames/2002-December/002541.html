<PRE>I can't find any right now - but there is always an ad running in a couple
gaming magazines (maybe MacAddict also).. There is some mouse that has more
than double the res. of anything on the market. I believe it may be
specifically designed for your purposes..

Have you asked over at the MacNN or MacAddict forums?

&gt;&gt;<i> Nevin, do you find the performance of your optical mouse sketchy on all

</I>&gt;<i> technology.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Either that - or you have a lower optical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolution with your mouse. The newer ones are higher (can't quote numbers),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and provide a pixel to pixel higher perfromance rate than a 'normal' or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> older optical mouse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is probably it.  I'm using a two-year-old Kensington mouse, and I
</I>&gt;<i> think at that time there was only one basic resolution used by all optical
</I>&gt;<i> mice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone else who's had similar trouble with old optical mice (works fine
</I>&gt;<i> in normal circumstances, but not in intense games) confirm for me that the
</I>&gt;<i> problem went away with newer, fancier optical mice?  I'll probably be
</I>&gt;<i> buying a new one within a few months (to replace the 1-button Pro Mouse
</I>&gt;<i> that I'm using on my second computer), and I'd like to be confident that it
</I>&gt;<i> will work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Nevin
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (By the way:  If anyone else is using a Kensington optical mouse, I've
</I>&gt;<i> found that its performance is much better if you turn the Kensington
</I>&gt;<i> drivers OFF.  Under OS 8/9, at least.  I'm just using the aforementioned
</I>&gt;<i> Pro Mouse on my X machine.  The Kensington drivers do some cool tricks that
</I>&gt;<i> can be useful in normal applications, but the standard Input Sprockets do
</I>&gt;<i> everything you need in games.  And in many games, especially ones based on
</I>&gt;<i> the Quake 3 engine, I couldn't turn around at even a moderate speed until I
</I>&gt;<i> disabled the drivers.  After that, everything is fine as long as I don't
</I>&gt;<i> shoot around as fast as I can.)
