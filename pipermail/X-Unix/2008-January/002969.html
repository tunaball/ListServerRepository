<PRE>For those of you with interest in this goat rope, there has been a  
development that isn't surprising in hindsight; in fact most of you  
will simply think &quot;well, duh!&quot; But, for any other noobs struggling to  
make sense of it all, consider this:

I was having sporadic &amp; bizarre trouble with DVD burns on my &quot;system  
#2&quot; MacBookPro (see below; running Leopard) and after much  
troubleshooting, tracked the problem down to some errant system &amp;  
plist files.

The MBPro Leopard had been a clean install, not an upgrade, but it  
got a &quot;migration assist&quot; from my existing Tiger system. On the  
suspicion that the migration might have caused other issues, I erased  
&amp; re-installed &amp; updated Leopard on the MBPro, AND installed every  
necessary piece of software from scratch (i.e., NO migration).

Lo and behold, finder copies of the kind that formerly went at 25  
megabits per second are now shooting across at full speed (100 mbps).

So, although there was no indication in my console or system logs  
that anything was awry before the reinstall, in fact that pesky  
migration assistant evidently produced some sort of havoc. The Finder  
now copies as fast as rsync.

Moral, for me: Never, ever use migration assistant for major system  
upgrades; it oughta be a law...
