The computer is on 24/7, with the monitor set to turn off after 5
minutes of inactivity.

&gt;<i> I assumed that the script was written in Bash, piping curl to grep to

</I>
That's the way the script is written (well, lynx instead of curl).
Clumsy? Sure, but better than showing up at the school on a cold
morning to find out they've announced a delay due to &quot;cold&quot; (I'm from
Massachusetts... they don't cancel school for &quot;cold&quot; and maybe not
even for snow).

&gt;<i> Finally - I considered writing this in my original response - no
</I>&gt;<i> language which we discuss here is the best one for the task. The
</I>&gt;<i> easiest programming syntax is &quot;hey, kid! make sure you check this
</I>&gt;<i> webpage every day - it tells you if you get a day off school.&quot;
</I>
The kid is 5, and if he wakes up to check a webpage he can't read,
he's going to be up for the day.  If the computer can wake me up in
time for me to turn off his alarm, I can get back to sleep no problem.

Oh, and Eric Crist suggested signing up with the schools.  Trust me,
if they had such a program, I'd be happy to sign up.  They city school
system doesn't even list closings on their website.  Honestly the best
solution might be to call the city school administration and offer to
maintain the school closing page and have them call me when it needs
to be updated.
