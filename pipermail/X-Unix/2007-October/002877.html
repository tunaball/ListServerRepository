<PRE>I am preparing to configure a number of OS X NFS + automounter clients
to Sun Solaris servers.

It's been a while since I needed to do this, primarily around the 10.1
to 10.2 time period.  I have been doing some RTFM'ing, and most of the
online documentation I have come across is from the same time period.  I
also had the following email (below) in my archives.

I am curious if anyone else on the list is doing similar things, and if
things have changed much from the 10.1/10.2 time period.  I know last
time I spent a lot of time with Netinfo/niutil .

TIA for any comments,

Jerry

Subject: [X-Unix] NFS mounted directory and iTunes weirdness
Date: Sun, 12 May 2002 23:54:43 -0400
From: Morgan Reed &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-unix.html">morganew at mac.com</A>&gt;

Hi,

I am mounting NFS directories via the command line using:

mount_nfs -P 192.168.1.77:/mnt/hdb1 /Volumes/mp3s

Which works just fine (I have made an ln in my home directory so it mounts
on the desktop)

The odd part happens when iTunes plays songs; about 20% of the time, iTunes
will play a song, and then when I look at the desktop, I see a new mounted
disk icon with the label &quot;192.168.1.77&quot;  If I go to another song, another
icon shows on the desktop labeled &quot;192.168.1.77-1&quot; and so on.  I have not
been really scientific about what steps make this happen, but it does occur.
Any ideas why?

Also,  I can find NO good info on NFS, the Apple manual is horrible for me,
it may be good if you are setting up zones and everything using NetInfo, but
for the user connecting to other boxes that don't use it, I find it very
obscure and hard to follow, this brings me to problem # 2 with iTunes:

If I own a file on an NFS volume, I can edit its tag in iTunes, however, if
I am a member of the file's group, I cannot edit the tag, even if group has
read and write permissions.

This is tied into NetInfo b/c I have used NetInfo to make my OSX user part
of the group on my Linux box. It works perfectly for editing, saving and
even deleting files as found by the finder, just iTunes seems to get werid
if my UID is wrong.

FInally, I have not been successful with using NFSManager to automount my
NFS volumes; I still do it by hand.  Thankfully, I don't re-boot very often,
so I don't really mind.

Frankly, for most unix-y tasks, I have found the GUI tools to be difficult,
especially those tied to NetInfo.  Maybe I am just a moron.  If someone out
there is a NetInfo wizard, I bet there are other morons would could use a
hand.  If it isn't already done, I would love to ask a bunch of NetInfo
questions, get the answers and type up an FAQ for others, I just need a
source of information.
