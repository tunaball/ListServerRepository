<PRE>Hi John,

This list is for using the COMMAND LINE on OS X. The Finder is a  
graphical application, so it's not strictly relevant to this list.

Having said that, I think you can fix your Finder / iTunes problem,  
using the command line.

For instance, when I said:

   Open Terminal and type `ls ` (with the space, no quotes) and drag
   and drop [this messed up folder] on to it. Press enter. What does
   it say? Paste the results back to us.

I wasn't just saying that for my own entertainment.

When I say:

   So you can probably `cp -rvf ` this folder somewhere and then `mv
   foldername.app folder`.

I don't mean &quot;copy it with the Finder&quot;, I mean &quot;type some commands  
into the Terminal window&quot;. I didn't specify which ones at this stage,  
because first you'd need to get back to use with the results I  
already asked for.

If you're confused by what I mean by &quot;the Terminal&quot; then you can find  
this program in Application &gt; Utilities.

I think your problem can be fixed in under a minute using the command  
line. I could be wrong in that, but I have no idea until you give  
more information. But you might want to delay trying to doing so for  
an hour or two, and work your way through these tutorials first:
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mcelhearn.com/article.php?story=200409211327301">http://www.mcelhearn.com/article.php?story=200409211327301</A>&gt;

Those tutorials should give you an idea of what I'm talking about  
when I use words like `ls` and `cp`, and my words:

   Open Terminal and type `ls ` (with the space, no quotes) and drag
   and drop [this messed up folder] on to it. Press enter. What does
   it say? Paste the results back to us.

should then make sense to you.

When you come back to us, you need to post back something that looks  
vaguely like this:

   Stroller's Mac ~ $ ls
   Desktop         Library         Music           Public          foo
   Documents       Movies          Pictures        Sites

   -rw-r--r--     1 stroller  stroller  5396002 May 25 03:02 iTunes  
Music Library.xml
   Stroller's Mac ~ $

Posting back output from the terminal is standard operational  
procedure when asking for help on Unix-orientated mailing lists. It  
helps us understand FAR better than your description what is going on  
and what you're doing. You need to include the command you used, as  
well as the output - as I've copied from `ls -l Music/iTunes/` above,  
all through the output that that command returns, and then the next  
prompt (&quot;Stroller's Mac ~ $&quot;). This is &quot;one standard unit&quot; of the  
command-line copy-and-paste that you should be providing.

Cheers,

Stroller.
