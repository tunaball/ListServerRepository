If you have a copy in sent items then perhaps you could resend a copy  
direct to me, so I can enjoy your 5K of wisdom.

&gt;<i> First, I would try to kill the process that's involved with  
</I>&gt;<i> transferring or otherwise reading the file over the network.
</I>
Hmmmn, I thought that WAS Finder that did this.

&gt;<i> Second, if that fails, I'd try killing the process that's involved  
</I>&gt;<i> with QuickLook.  I don't think this is internal to Finder itself,  
</I>&gt;<i> so there should be a separate process.
</I>
Ah! No, I'm using 10.4 - the preview that it was generating was this  
kind:
<A HREF="http://www.bioneural.net/wp-content/uploads/iblog/d70rawtiger.jpg">http://www.bioneural.net/wp-content/uploads/iblog/d70rawtiger.jpg</A>
(except of a movie, obviously)

&gt;<i> reading through all of the output for your user with ps should at  
</I>&gt;<i> least give you some clues as to what you can try to kill along the  
</I>&gt;<i> way.  Unfortunately, the only thing you can do is experiment.  The  
</I>&gt;<i> disturbing thing is that a kill -9 on Finder isn't working.
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps.  Try posting a copy of a ps auxwwwww here, or at  
</I>&gt;<i> least directly to me.

Attached. Had to zip it because it was 8k alone.

The most interesting process is &quot;/sbin/umount -f /Volumes/4GIG CF&quot; -  
this refers to a CFcard that was plugged into my Mac through an  
adaptor dongle.

Maybe my memory is mistaken as to what I was doing when Finder died,  
because copying to this CFcard stalled at c 20% and I got a complaint  
about removal when I pulled it.

Perhaps its this unmount process that's holding the Finder up, but  
that doesn't respond to `sudo kill -9 6180`either.
Is there any way to force restart the disk automounting daemon?

&gt;<i> You could try nice(ing) the processes you're interested in save to  
</I>&gt;<i> get them the proc time so you can save your work, but I'm afraid  
</I>&gt;<i> you may be stuck rebooting the system if all this fails.
</I>
That's not the problem at all - everything else on my system is  
running fine. There's no problem with stuff hogging the CPU - other  
applications respond quickly and I can save from them. It's just that  
I don't want to close this particular program if I can help it,  
because one *can't* save its state. It's actually not that important  
and I guess I could reboot if I had to, but this is annoying me, now,  
and I'd just like to get to the bottom of the problem.

Stroller.
