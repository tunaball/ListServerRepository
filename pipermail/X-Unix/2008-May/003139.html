</I>&gt;<i> But I can't open it. IOW, I can't restore the hierarchical folder

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, I copied the large file as you suggested, and

</I>&gt;<i> new file, I got &quot;Not a directory.&quot; That's what my problem is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And, of course, when I try to open the large file, Finder asks
</I>&gt;<i> me to choose an application. As I said in my first posting, I
</I>&gt;<i> can open the file in an editor (I used ed) and see the 30+
</I>&gt;<i> megabytes, but I don't know how to make sense of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm assuming the original folder structure is intact, but some
</I>&gt;<i> header data has been changed. The size of the large file is about
</I>&gt;<i> the same as my original iTunes Library was. (I didn't track
</I>&gt;<i> the exact size.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just was hoping there was some header data I could remove that
</I>&gt;<i> would make the original folder structure reappear. Way back
</I>&gt;<i> when OS X disposed of the resource forks, maybe there was
</I>&gt;<i> something inserted in the header of an application file
</I>&gt;<i> to replace it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wishful thinking?
</I>
Unless I am really mistaken, .app &quot;files&quot; are not files, just folder with a
bundle attribute, just like .pkg files. So if all you see is a file, and
not a directory, I believe something even more screwed up occured.
