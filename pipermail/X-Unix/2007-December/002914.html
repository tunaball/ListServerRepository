<PRE>I've had the mailbounce from this (7kb, limit of 5kb) for a few days  
- sorry I haven't gotten round to resending it before.

I don't quite know how to respond to this, because I don't quite  
understand the symptoms. If you'd like to explain this `ls` sorting a  
bit better - or give an example of the output? - I'd love to get to  
the bottom of this &amp; prove that it's a bug (whether the fault of  
yourself, your distro or GNU, it doesn't matter to me), rather than a  
feature.

Note:
      (1) If you use a non-POSIX locale (e.g., by setting `LC_ALL' to
   `en_US'), then `ls' may produce output that is sorted differently  
than
   you're accustomed to.  In that case, set the `LC_ALL' environment
   variable to `C'.
   [from `info ls`]

</I>
Ok, I don't know about your tar problem (it appears to work fine here)

Looking just at `ls` [1] I can immediately imagine occasions when the  
'-A&quot;, &quot;-b&quot;, &quot;-m&quot; and &quot;-i&quot; GNU options could be useful. I admit I  
can't think of &quot;much needed&quot; improvements off the top of my head, but  
I bet I could find some if I spent enough time looking. I just don't  
think a language should stay static just because &quot;this is the way  
we've always done things&quot;.

&gt;<i> I've no problem with them making the changes they do, as long as

</I>
I believe that there few GNU additions that break cross-platform  
scripts - all GNU utilities that I'm aware of accept POSIX options  
and it's clearly the intention that they behave correctly when POSIX  
options are provided.
