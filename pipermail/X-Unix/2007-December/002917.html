And I've been lighting the village pantomime.

</I>&gt;<i>yourself, your distro or GNU, it doesn't matter to me), rather than 
</I>&gt;<i>a feature.
</I>
It sorts '.' files as if the '.' were not present - so '.profile' 
sorts into the 'p's rather than between .kshrc and .ssh; which 
themselves are among the 'k's and the 's's.

&gt;<i>Note:
</I>&gt;<i>      (1) If you use a non-POSIX locale (e.g., by setting `LC_ALL' to
</I>&gt;<i>   `en_US'), then `ls' may produce output that is sorted differently than
</I>&gt;<i>   you're accustomed to.  In that case, set the `LC_ALL' environment
</I>&gt;<i>   variable to `C'.
</I>&gt;<i>   [from `info ls`]
</I>
Hadn't thought of locale. It will be the default, which is usually 'C'.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  The GNU versions of the &quot;standard utilities&quot; are different from 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>those in Posix, System V or the BSDs, but I personally think these 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>changes are often (much needed) improvements upon the originals 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>and are generally for the best. IMO Bash &amp; the GNU utilis are what 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>a modern Unix shouldbe aiming for - it's certainly my expectation 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>in terms of ease-of-use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I've yet to find a change that I would class as a much needed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>improvement other than 'tar's new unwillingness to archive from '/'.
</I>&gt;<i>Ok, I don't know about your tar problem (it appears to work fine here)
</I>
As I say, that is one improvement. Under 'real' tar, 'tar cf bin.tar 
/bin' would put a tar archive of /bin to file bin.tar; and later 'tar 
xf bin.tar' would only restore to /bin. no way to unarchive to 
/tmp/bin or anywhere else. This often caught people out. The GNU tar 
removes the leading '/' on archiving so that unarchiving creates a 
'bin' directory in the current directory which can be anywhere.

&gt;<i>Looking just at `ls` [1] I can immediately imagine occasions when 
</I>&gt;<i>the '-A&quot;, &quot;-b&quot;, &quot;-m&quot; and &quot;-i&quot; GNU options could be useful. I admit I 
</I>&gt;<i>can't think of &quot;much needed&quot; improvements off the top of my head, 
</I>&gt;<i>but I bet I could find some if I spent enough time looking. I just 
</I>&gt;<i>don't think a language should stay static just because &quot;this is the 
</I>&gt;<i>way we've always done things&quot;.
</I>
-A -b and -i are standard back, I think, to Version 6. Changes should 
always be able to be turned off.

&gt;<i>I believe that there few GNU additions that break cross-platform 
</I>&gt;<i>scripts - all GNU utilities that I'm aware of accept POSIX options 
</I>&gt;<i>and it's clearly the intention that they behave correctly when POSIX 
</I>&gt;<i>options are provided.
</I>
Unfortunately POSIX compliance has nothing to do with this sort of 
thing. Some version of VMS is POSIX compliant and nothing like Unix 
at the keyboard.

&gt;<i>The --givetheoptionalongnamesopeopleknowwhatitsdoes flags are no 
</I>&gt;<i>specified for exactly that reason.
</I>&gt;<i>Hardly anyone continues to use that format once they're familiar 
</I>&gt;<i>with a command - one will naturally use the &quot;-v&quot; form - but if you 
</I>&gt;<i>use a command infrequently then the long version may be more 
</I>&gt;<i>memorable (not less, as you assert).
</I>
Far from all commands have simple flags that correspond to the full 
ones. The long ones are far from memorable, bearing in mind that they 
don't work if you make a minor error. As for emailing, I'm not sure 
where politeness comes in. If 'ls -xyz' is the command then 'ls -xyz' 
is the command. You can always add xmeans ... , y means ... . The 
short form is also less likely to get wrapped.

&gt;<i>If you're using Linux at the enterprise level then doesn't that 
</I>&gt;<i>prove it's ready?   ;)
</I>
No. It causes so many problems. What use is a system which, on losing 
connection to storage on the SAN for a few milliseconds (which can 
happen at busy times), decides to change the mount to read-only - the 
only fix being a reboot. Luckily for the users load sharing covers 
the tracks when these errant servers are rebooted, but the service 
does stall for some when it happens.
