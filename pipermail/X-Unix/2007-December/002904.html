Does the same when using /bin/ls, so it's not an inherited alias or 
function. I work under ksh with my own aliases pointing back at 
/bin/ls anyway.

I've yet to find a change that I would class as a much needed 
improvement other than 'tar's new unwillingness to archive from '/'. 
I've no problem with them making the changes they do, as long as they 
require a flag, environment variable or '.' file to trigger them. 
Just making arbitrary changes break what would be cross platform 
scripts.

When I used to do 'ssh &lt;host&gt; &lt;command&gt;' I now have to do
	case &quot;$(ssh &lt;host&gt; uname)&quot; in
	Linux)	ssh &lt;host&gt; &lt;Linux version of command&gt; ;;
	*)	ssh &lt;host&gt; &lt;command&gt; ;;
	esac
or I would if I didn't have a local cache of what each host runs to 
query instead.

As for ease of use, I don't know what is easier about Linux. One of 
the original command line objectives of Unix, never use two 
keystrokes where one would do, is lost in Linux with its 
--givetheoptionalongnamesopeopleknowwhatitsdoes flags that you can't 
remember.

&gt;<i>I'd be surprised if Dead Rat - or any other modern distro - is using

</I>&gt;<i>bit of hunting around - it should be possible to pin down how `ls` 
</I>&gt;<i>is being called and get it to behave the way you expect.
</I>
I wouldn't know what the GNU one is like. My Linux exposure is small, 
as it's mainly useful on the desktop. These machines are some that 
are used at the enterprise level, and proving weekly that it's not 
quite ready yet.
