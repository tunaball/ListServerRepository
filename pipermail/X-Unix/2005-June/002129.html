Yes, that's what I mean...I have not done the NetInfo thing.

I did some more googling and found an in-depth discussion of the security
aspects of this thing back in March 2005 on MacInTouch.  For those
interested, here it is:

<A HREF="http://www.macintouch.com/security-finder.html">http://www.macintouch.com/security-finder.html</A>

But for me, the security breach is a symptom and not the cause that I am
interested in.

I did some more experiments and found that if I put in my crontab this
command (#1):

/Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp

it still launches behind the Login Window (in Tiger, not Panther), but now
the user is the &quot;expected&quot; user, i.e., me, i.e., the user whose crontab the
command is in.  I can detect this situation (currentUser notEquals
consoleUser) and deal with it by running my app facelessly.

But if, as I said in my original post, I put in my crontab this command
(#2):

/usr/bin/open &quot;/Applications/MyApp.app&quot;

it launches in the login window, but the user is root.  Arghhhh!!

Here is my explanation.  From &quot;man open&quot;, I see that &quot;open&quot; is an invention
of NextStep.  Further,

&quot;The open command opens a file (or a directory or URL), just as if you had
double-clicked the file's icon.&quot;

But they don't say who &quot;you&quot; is.  My theory is that &quot;you&quot; is not the owner
of the parent process, but whoever is currently at the console, because
that's the only person who can &quot;doubleclick&quot; on anything.  But, when the
Login Window is showing, root is at the console.  BANG!!
