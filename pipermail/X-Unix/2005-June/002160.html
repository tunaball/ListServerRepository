I have been described as dense, so perhaps that is why I didn't
detect your sarcasm.  I still don't see any sarcasm, even after
being told it is there.

That said, I do agree with you that the presence of sudo does
not, in any way, prove that root is (or has ever been) enabled.

However, I think using the &quot;cd&quot; command as an exmple of this is
in poor form.  The main reason for this is that there is no &quot;cd&quot;
command.

&gt;<i> If a root account is enabled, and I log in as root, I can go anywhere 
</I>&gt;<i> on the computer into 'my' 'root' 'home', into other accounts, etc). 
</I>&gt;<i> But with no root enabled, there are 'walls'...sudo, or no sudo.
</I>
That said, pls show me one thing that a regular user cannot do
with sudo.  I do not believe the the open command is an example
of this, because it has been shown that it does not respect the
user it was run at; it seems to be the user currently logged into
the console.

Another way to say that is &quot;open&quot; does not allow GUI programs to
be executed as an arbitrary user.  Even root cannot &quot;open&quot; a
Finder (or anything else) as a different user.

Given all that, if you really do want a root Finder, then I think
this will do it:

    $ sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder
