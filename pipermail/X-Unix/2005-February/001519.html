Dave,

OS X does not honor the &quot;s&quot; flag (&quot;s&quot; for &quot;set-id&quot;) on removable 
volumes, as that would mean someone could use a removable disk or 
drive to gain root privileges.

What is happening at the moment is the USB drive is being mounted with
the &quot;nosuid&quot; option (see the man page for mount). You can turn that 
off until the next reboot by doing the following:

sudo mount -uw &quot;/Volumes/Bonehead&quot;

To make this happen during startup you will have to create a startup 
script that runs as root during system startup. Mac OSX startup is 
exactly like OSX Sever in this case, so just follow the general 
instructions on

<A HREF="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107671">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107671</A>

Note that you're running at root when you run durig startup

Make sure you setup your plist correctly.

Tom
