Assuming that the problem is not 1 above, this then is clearly the 
problem. What I was alluding to in my earlier comment about using 
emacs:
      &quot;Since this is &quot;legoland&quot; something, I would assume that
       the file name is full of &quot;foreign&quot; (Danish) characters
       encoded via something other than utf-8.&quot;

The fact that emacs fails to deal with the file pretty much verifies 
the Unicode issue.

&gt;<i> What you need is a Carbon application to delete this file.  My 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion would be to reverse the process.  You've got an archive 
</I>&gt;<i> that created this filename -- use StuffIt or something to delete it.  
</I>&gt;<i> Select the enclosing folder and tell StuffIt to create an archive and 
</I>&gt;<i> delete the original.  My guess is that StuffIt will use the Carbon 
</I>&gt;<i> APIs, get the Unicode version of the filename (or, more likely, its 
</I>&gt;<i> FSRef), and delete it with no muss or fuss.
</I>
Hmmm ... sounds like a good trick!

... I deleted the original some time ago, but yesterday,

So, one question is -- how did this file get to OS X in the first place?

Apparently by way of Linux, not from a zip file.

So this was this a Linux kernel writing to a Mac OS X volume?
A &quot;ufs&quot; volume being shared between two different operating systems?

Either technique should scream &quot;potential incompatibility&quot; leading to 
&quot;filesystem corruption.&quot;

How about using the Linux Live CD to delete the file?
