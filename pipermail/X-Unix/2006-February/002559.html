My initial reaction to this is that &quot;of course, that's right&quot; but a  
glance at RFC1122 suggests the isn't actually so simple that it can  
be expressed that way. Nevertheless I think this is an extremely good  
basis for argument.

&gt;<i> A bit more detail for those interested: We're accepting (on machine

</I>&gt;<i> ACK go out... and then nothing. After 5 minutes, our server sends a  
</I>&gt;<i> finish every one minute, after which a reset will be returned  
</I>&gt;<i> (sometimes after a few finishes have been sent).
</I>
I would take the stance that this is pretty damning evidence that the  
other party's machine isn't doing it's job, although to be honest I'd  
feel happier if I were seeing it by packet-sniffing on a second  
machine (I bridged two network interfaces on a second machine and ran  
ethereal, I think, maybe snort, when I wanted to do this). There's  
surely no way to prove (with the equipment available to you) that the  
ACK packets are leaving your network past the ADSL router, but a  
reasonable log of what you're seeing should be sufficient to pass the  
onus onto the other party to prove that their machine isn't misbehaving.

Beer soon?

Stroller.
