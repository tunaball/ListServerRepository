Yeah, maybe. But with &quot;big&quot; ISP's like Earthlink, they are not much 
different from TPC (The phone company) ... things get magically fixed 
even though their logs show no problems.

</I>
Correct.

The only trick/problem with PPOE based ISPs is that they frequently 
block ping (ICMP) traffic.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have had DSL since the beginning, so I have a seriously dumb and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-manageable DSL modem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mine may be more manageable but you have to connect a Windows PC with 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> old-fashioned RS232 to the &quot;comm&quot; port.  I don't think it is &quot;web
</I>&gt;<i> addressable.&quot;
</I>
That's probably only for the pretty GUI. It probably has an 
&quot;undocumented&quot; command line interface. Try simply connecting the serial 
port on the Mac (via a Keyspan serial adapter) and use something like 
Kermit to connect to it. (you need a serial communications program, not 
a TCP/IP based program. ... unless of course the modem actually 
supports PPP itself, which is a possibility.

What kind of modem is it? You can probably find the OEM specs on the 
web.

&gt;<i> During the last hour, I set my pop email client to check for email 
</I>&gt;<i> every 1
</I>&gt;<i> minute.  The trouble I found is that, with PPPoE, once the connection 
</I>&gt;<i> drops,
</I>&gt;<i> it seems the Mac OS defaults to the internal modem (even though it is 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;not
</I>&gt;<i> configured&quot;), and does not seem try to re-establish PPPoE until I open
</I>&gt;<i> System Preferences &gt; Network &gt; Show: Network Status and click Connect. 
</I>&gt;<i>  This
</I>&gt;<i> is even though I have checked &quot;Connec automatially when needed&quot; and  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Send
</I>&gt;<i> PPP echo packets&quot;, and un-checked &quot;Disconnect if idle&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone know if this can be made to reconnect automatically with 
</I>&gt;<i> PPPoE?
</I>
Check MacOXhints or  MacFixit ... I've heard discussions about this 
problem but don't recall where.  Although, I know it is common as 
Linksys has instructions for dealing with it under Windows as part of 
their Users manual.

They include the comment -- &quot;PPPoE by nature is not a &quot;dedicated 
connection&quot;. The DSL Internet Service Provider can disconnect the 
service after a period of inactivity, just like the normal phone 
dial-up connection to the Internet. There is an option to Keep Alive. 
This may not ways work, so you may need to re-establish connection.&quot;

&gt;&gt;<i> As far as troubleshooting interference on the DSL line, the most 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> likely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem has to do with the modem loosing sync with the DSLAM. The 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cause
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is one of two things -- either you have real &quot;line noise&quot; problem; or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you have CO activity which results in the DSLAM being reset on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;routine&quot; basis by Telco technicians....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe the problem is impulse noise which comes and goes.  Until
</I>&gt;<i> recently, we only had the problem when it rained, but during the past 
</I>&gt;<i> sunny
</I>&gt;<i> week it's been doing it on and off all day.  There is a correlation 
</I>&gt;<i> between
</I>&gt;<i> the DSL being out of sync, with the amount of impulse noise (which 
</I>&gt;<i> sounds
</I>&gt;<i> like kkkkick......kkkkkick) that I hear on our voice telephone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> William, please post your script when you get a chance!!
</I>
Unless there's a great deal of interest, I'll send it to you 
independently.
It's a typical hack ... not packaged or documented.
