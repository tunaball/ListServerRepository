Ah! I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this one. It's perhaps 
illustrative of my background, but I find .xxx file extensions natural 
&amp; intuitive.

&gt;<i> Resource forks (when properly formatted) contains structured data.  A 
</I>&gt;<i> structure that is defined a manipulated by the Macintosh operating 
</I>&gt;<i> system.  As such, arbitrary small data objects (let's call them

</I>&gt;<i> Either with the file's data or any other blobs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, many web and FTP clients used to add a small resource to

</I>&gt;<i> Other programs would batch process files and add a high-quality

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Resource forks, like so many aspects of the original Macintosh design,

</I>
Perhaps so. But, as you say, most filesystems don't understand them. I 
can see the value in having a repository of &quot;miscellaneous and useful 
`stuff'&quot; to be associated with a file, as long as application 
developers don't insist in putting *essential* stuff in there. I think 
this thread has given me a better appreciation of resource forks; I 
read some time ago about Hans Reiser's filesystem, and I now realise 
that resource forks are very similar to something that he wishes (or is 
trying) to implement.

However, in a largely single-fork world it should, I believe, be safe 
to assume that the resource fork can be lost without damage.
