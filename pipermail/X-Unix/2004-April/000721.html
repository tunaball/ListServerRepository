My understanding is that there is nothing in a resource fork that
could not be saved in a data fork.  If there were 3 &quot;thingies&quot; in
a file (JPEG data, thumbnail, and original url) the JPEG data
would be in the data fork, thumbnail and url in the resource
fork.  However, these things could be saved in separate files,
all with a single data fork.

So, why then did Apple choose to have a seemingly redundant and
most certainly proprietary (meaning that there exists the
possibility for data loss / incompatibilities with single fork
based computers) system?  First they wanted a mechanism to give
their users easy installation and deletion of applications.  If
an application has it's data stored in one physical file but
separated logically by systemmatic and logical APIs then it is a
boon for the developer and user.

The user doesn't have to worry about application files scattered
all over the place.  They can uninstall simply by dragging to the
trash (sound familiar).  However, if this application file is
copied to a single fork system and back again their are problems.

Yet, the problems weren't really that severe at the time of
resource fork introduction (not sure exactly when).  This would
have been the time of BBSes and way before the internet, and in
addition to this, if you had a network of computers they were
most often homogenous.  You simply didn't share data with &quot;other&quot;
computer systems as much.

Now, with millions of different computers connected everywhere,
Apple is discouraging the use of resource forks in lieu of
placing everything in a data fork.

A lot of this info came from my recollection of reading sources
over time.  I would very much like it if someone would comment if
I have made an error...
