I'm sorry you feel this way. I'm afraid all I can do is say you don't. 
In my books, bitching (if that's what you're doing) is good. I find few 
things are more stimulating (or more educative) than being forced to 
re-examine and support one's assumptions. That doesn't irk me -- 
filling up tax returns does.

&gt;<i> I do not intend to [...] imply that resource forks are in any way 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bad&quot; [...]
</I>
Why not? Perhaps they are. The point is that -- IMHO -- you haven't 
offered any arguments to that effect, except that they're not 
understood by other OSs. Which is perfectly valid, but not the point.

&gt;<i> [...] as a personal preference, I don't like or understand them.
</I>
That's a different matter. De gustibus... I don't like or understand 
Schoenberg or Alban Berg, but that doesn't mean they're no good.

&gt;<i> [...] I am learning Chinese.
</I>
My condolences.

&gt;<i> [...] It's more like I whine, &quot;I don't like having to speak Chinese, 
</I>&gt;<i> and sometimes miss living in my home country, where everyone speaks 
</I>&gt;<i> English&quot;. I'm sorry that my complaints bother you.
</I>
You shouldn't be sorry and they don't bother me. As an immigrant who 
makes his life in a different culture and in a second language, I 
understand quite well. But it's not something amenable to argument -- 
it's pure emotion.
