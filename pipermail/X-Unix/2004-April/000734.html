And that is going to help me persuade my musicologist friend that 
&quot;Erwartung&quot; is crap -- how, exactly?

They're perfectly transparent. The user has no clue they're there 
(witness Stroller's initial mishap). Wish my windows had that kind of 
transparency, especially on a nice sunny day like today.

&gt;<i> [...] are not portable to

In other words, the rest of the world hasn't yet caught up with the 
Mac. Oh well, what can you do -- just have patience, trust in progress, 
and wait.

Maybe yes, and maybe no -- so what? The &quot;mere idea of criticizing the 
government, of being secure from arbitrary arrest, of having a fair 
trial (or even a fairish trial, or even a trial at all)&quot; [Robert 
Conquest] has been the privilege of a tiny minority of human beings for 
a tiny part of the history of the human race -- and certainly doesn't 
represent in the least the political experience of the vast majority 
('way more than 95%). Does that mean it's bad, and we should be in a 
rush to give it up?
