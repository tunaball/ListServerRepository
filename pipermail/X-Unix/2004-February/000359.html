That's tosh.

Both client &amp; server versions of OS X are exactly the same under the 
hood - a much better analogy is that they are both the same make &amp; type 
of car, except that OS X server has the higher-end &quot;trim&quot; &amp; &quot;options&quot; 
for more demanding drivers.

If OS X server is a general-purpose, multi-user, time-sharing, Unix 
system, then so is OS X client - as I understand it the only difference 
between the two is a few GUI admin goodies. I do agree that is a 
reasonable expectation that most workstation- and domestic-users would 
have no need to add more than 99 users, however to say on only that 
basis that OS X client isn't &quot;a general-purpose, multi-user, 
time-sharing, Unix system&quot; I find bizarre.

I personally don't feel that one &quot;should have to pay extra for the GUI 
admin goodies - the cost of production of them must be relatively low 
for Apple, and it seems like a bit of a racket to charge much for them. 
But what I think &quot;should&quot; happen has nothing at all to do with 
economics, and Apple is allowed to bundle these tools any way they wish 
- I would have thought that with 99 users the cost / user of these 
goodies would be relatively low, and would have saved the OP's time &amp; 
energy so far.

Since the OP is a self-confessed cheapskate after my own heart, I 
recommend he read 
&lt;<A HREF="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=30760">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=30760</A>&gt; and 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.osxfaq.com/FAQ/User_Admin_FAQ/index.ws">http://www.osxfaq.com/FAQ/User_Admin_FAQ/index.ws</A>&gt;. If these utilities 
are unable to add a one-hundredth user, then it certainly IS a bug.

Stroller.
