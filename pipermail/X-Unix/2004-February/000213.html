Thanks, Juan, for first of all mentioning a &quot;fink alternative&quot;, which I 
had
not previously been aware of.  I will look into DarwinPorts.

&gt;<i> In any case, as far as I can see, ethereal compiles from source cleanly
</I>&gt;<i> on Mac OS X, without the need of any patch (I've done this with the 
</I>&gt;<i> 0.9.14
</I>&gt;<i> release).
</I>
I tried that, but found it was asking for glib (and who knows what 
other ones
I haven't yet found out about that are missing).  The more things I have
to pile on my OSX systems that didn't already come with it, the more 
nervous
I get about breaking something else in the future.  Hmmm...

&gt;<i> But if you can't be bothered to do that I'd advise you to surf over to
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org">http://darwinports.opendarwin.org</A> and join the project.
</I>
The idea case would be &quot;I can't be bothered with compiling source, and 
would
rather just run prebuilt binaries&quot;, and sometime that's the case.  I'd 
like
to be able to go either way, though.

&gt;<i> It might be a bit of a nuisance at first because you have to fetch it
</I>&gt;<i> over CVS...
</I>
Don't even know what this is, sorry... :)

&gt;<i> ...but once everything is in place it pays for itself.  I'm an active
</I>&gt;<i> DarwinPorts user and &quot;contributor wannabe&quot; and am well satisfied with
</I>&gt;<i> what it offers.
</I>
I, too, think of myself as a &quot;contributor wannabe&quot;, though I have done
little to enhance my status with regard to that title.  I'd love to see 
a
lot more X-based apps ported to native Darwin format, as I feel 
X-Windows
apps were good for a certain time, but they are outliving their 
usefulness
in today's world.  Too topheavy, too ugly, too prone to unnecessary 
failures.

&gt;<i> With just one command I can have ethereal, nmap, dsniff and around 900
</I>&gt;<i> other software titles fetched, configured, compiled and installed.
</I>
Excellent.  I'll definitely check it out.

&gt;<i> Regarding ethereal specifically, I've been known among DarwinPorts 
</I>&gt;<i> developers
</I>&gt;<i> to be quite whimsical about it, hehe! (mainly because I dislike 
</I>&gt;<i> tcpdump).
</I>
(I'm with you there)

&gt;<i> Upon my constant requests a no-X11 build variant was included to the 
</I>&gt;<i> port
</I>&gt;<i> (meaning that only tethereal, the command line utility, and not 
</I>&gt;<i> ethereal,
</I>&gt;<i> the GUI, gets built).
</I>
I would add to that request a request to split out the packet capture
facility of ethereal (or any other net snooper for that matter) into a
separate, command-line utility, so one could script packet captures,
for later analysis by a more GUI-oriented too.  Perhaps this also 
already
exists (for OSX and others?)

&gt;<i> The release version was also upped to 0.9.16 and then to 0.10.0a,
</I>&gt;<i> but unfortunately that last one is severely broken.
</I>
Maybe that's part of my problem then.  I tried finking down the very
latest version of ethereal, which I believe was 0.10.0a.  I should back
up, I guess, to an earlier version (0.9.something, I guess).

Thanks for all the great info!
