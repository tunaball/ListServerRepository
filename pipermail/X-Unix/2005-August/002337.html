You have verified that the changes you make to your Address book  
propigate to your .Mac address book and then back to your PowerBook.  
(Or which ever).

My address book has many more entries than my .Mac account. The iSync  
panel claims that the Synch takes place... but the .Mac account never  
indicates that it has updated.

If one looks at the log files involved, the process appears to run  
successfully but fails to post the changes.

My iPod has the same problem.

Both synched regularly under Panther. They synched ONCE under Tiger.  
Once the synch operation wiped out the contents of the local Address  
book.

&gt;<i> What does this have to do with UNIX?
</I>
While you might believe this to be an Application problem, that may  
or may not be true. The fact that the Application is using TCP/IP  
communications as a transport and calls upon other OS functions opens  
up the possibility that there is are issues with what is taking place.

Historically, there have been people on this list who understand a  
great deal about OSX (not Unix) and how it works. Especially this  
kind of quirk. If you truly understand Unix, you also understand that  
there are interrelationships between the OS and applications,  
especially in OSX, which have &quot;interesting&quot; effects.

If you want to claim that Unix only applies to the Mach Kernel, then  
99.9% of what gets talked about is not relevant.

I know that Apple has had significant problems with .Mac and iSync  
since the release of Tiger. And I do not deny that this might be a  
pure Application Problem, however since this is Unix, one expects  
there to be logging and similar capabilities which can track down  
this kind of issue.
