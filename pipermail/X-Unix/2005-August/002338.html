<PRE>I am trying to setup an SFTP server to download copies of our website  
backups.  We make a full backup once a week, just over 2GB right now.

My webhost builds the backup archive and will send it to a remote FTP/ 
SFTP server.  I need to do this because when I make a backup, it  
nearly pushes me over our quota on the website and makes my mail  
server act up.  I have to use SFTP because of the 2GB limit of FTP.

I would also be open to using SSH and some form of secure copy.  I  
know very little about UNIX, so I'm looking for some help.  It  
doesn't have to be completely automated, but that would be very nice,  
to write a script.  I have SSH access to my web host.

So I'm looking for some help from the UNIX gurus out there to help me  
accomplish this.  I at least need a way to have the download sent  
manually to an SFTP server running on my OSX box, or better yet, some  
type of automated script to do this once a week, to fetch a backup  
off of my webhost. I can probably talk to them about helping me with  
a script and cron job to build the backup archive once a week.

I have read that there is a built in SFTP server in OSX, but I have  
no idea how to configure it.  I tried CrushFTP today and got it to  
connect and login, but when the download tried to start, I got a &quot;550  
Access not allowed&quot; error, then I remembered the 2GB limit for FTP,  
so I am guessing that was the cause because everything else seemed to  
be setup correctly, it got through my firewall, logged in  
successfully, etc.  So I have that part done right.

Can someone help me please?  Any help will be greatly appreciated.
