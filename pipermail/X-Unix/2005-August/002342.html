Absolutely. If it wasn't working, I wouldn't remember to go to my doctor's appointment tomorrow (iCal), or have the number to dial (Address Book) -- both of which were entered on my desktop machine and I'm now looking at them on my laptop.

&gt;<i>My address book has many more entries than my .Mac account. The iSync  
</I>&gt;<i>panel claims that the Synch takes place... but the .Mac account never  
</I>&gt;<i>indicates that it has updated.
</I>
I did remember that I had to &quot;reset&quot; the iSync the first time after I upgraded to Tiger. I don't remember what I did, or what dialog popped up, but I did remember having to say that everything on the .Mac site was golden and to ignore whatever was on my laptop. It has synced just fine ever since.

&gt;<i>If one looks at the log files involved, the process appears to run  
</I>&gt;<i>successfully but fails to post the changes.
</I>
Very odd.

&gt;<i>My iPod has the same problem.
</I>
I've also had no problems syncing my iPod.

If iPod syncing didn't work, I'm sure there would be angry mobs with torches surrounding the Cupertino campus.
