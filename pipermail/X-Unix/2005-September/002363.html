&gt;<i>My first question is: What do i name the proposed manually-mounted drive? Should I use one name for the entire drive (disregarding its 3 partitions?), and my idea, at this point, is to mount another working external drive on the firewire bus, make a note of the name the system assigns it, and then replace the drive with the one that seems to not mount, and use the 'notated' name as the name for the mount_hfs maneuver. Does that sound about right?
</I>
OS neXt names partitions and not disks. Disk Utility is a GUI application you should experiment with to format and name or rename HFS+ partitions.

pdisk and newfs are UNIX tools you should do a man on. newfs_hfs for HFS+.

&gt;<i>Second question: Mount point? The internal drive shows an inode of &quot;2&quot;. Is that a mount point? I thought the point would be an octal or hexadecimal allocation address of some kind, so i don't want to proceed until I have a solid, educated guess. Any clues on that?
</I>
the mount tools require an argument that is a preexisting and empty directory which will become the base address of the volume. In OS neXt it is customary to mkdir into /Volumes/ to create an empty directory before doing a mount. Mounting using the Finder GUI will do that for you.

Hex assignments, if they are possible at all, should not be required or attempted.

&gt;<i>I KNOW that the drive is sound, mechanically.  After the incident, the internal drive had a trashed directory, which DiskWarrior straightened out, easily.  I have to assume that the external drive's directory is simply trashed, to a greater degree (considering that the I/O was happening there, and was probably sabotaged by the Finder in cahoots with a subsequent crash of SystemUIServer). Apple Sys Profiler, and even Peripheral Vision see it as an IDE firewire device, but it shows up nowhere else, nor do its partitions (in PV or ASP).
</I>
I have trouble understanding how Disk Warrior can straighten out the volume / partition structure without recovering the volume names. One thing I have seen is a Linux installation that takes over a whole disk rather than just a requested partition on that disk. It makes a real mess. &quot;Partition map&quot; is a buzzword worth searching on.

&gt;<i>The drive contains 150 gigabytes of books and music, and other stuff.

Think New Orleans. I worry about the data.
