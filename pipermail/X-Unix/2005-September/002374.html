<PRE>I solved the problem myself. This is what I did in case anyone else
runs into a similar problem.

I found the hspc reference in the printcap file. I cross referenced my
B&amp;W tower and the printers defined on it had the loopback address in
that field. I changed it back to the loopback my home printer on my
iBook, then I was ready to restart printing services. I'd found a menu
entry in the printer utility labeled &quot;Reset Printing System.&quot; I
figured it would restart the printing services. It turns out that it
wipes out all printers and defaults back to Tiger defaults. Which was
OK in a sense, but I still think I could have solved my issue w/o
having to wipe out all the printers...

</I>&gt;<i> don't know what the hspc157449 name is exactly, but I think it has
</I>&gt;<i> something to do with our DNS server, a Lucent QIP server. When I
</I>&gt;<i> configure addresses in the QIP tool I often see something similar
</I>&gt;<i> before a host name is defined for an address. I know that it is not
</I>&gt;<i> the name of my XP machine, that's AB868703, and not the Samba name
</I>&gt;<i> for my iBook, that's Loki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&quot;ve looked in cupsd.conf, client.conf and printers.conf and
</I>&gt;<i> hostconfig and can't find any traces of the hspc host name. I've
</I>&gt;<i> deleted and readded my home printer, connected to an external jet
</I>&gt;<i> direct print server, but the song, err, host remained the same. I've
</I>&gt;<i> looked at the help files for the print setup utility and it would
</I>&gt;<i> only say that the host field &quot;displays the name of the computer
</I>&gt;<i> that's &quot;hosting&quot; or sharing the printer.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm at wits end. Does anyone have any suggestions. At this point I am
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly happy wiping out all of the defined printers and re-adding
</I>&gt;<i> them as need arises. Any help would be appreciated.
