I think Jerry is referring to the pre-build scheme. Which is the same 
thing only different. It just eliminates the dynamic linking phase and 
goes back to the old stand-by of statically linked programs. It doesn't 
load the program into any kind of cache.

He can't. I don't believe Xgrid works that way.

I haven't looked at Xgrid closely, but based on the way similar systems 
work, this is what I would expect...

 From what I understand, Xgrid is a classic master-slave setup common to 
so-called &quot;super-computers.&quot; (Long ago Digital had what we called 
&quot;Alpha Farms&quot; under what is now Tru64 Unix, but then was called OSF/1.) 
I say &quot;so-called&quot; because the premise is that the job in question can 
be carved up into little pieces and outsourced to random folk who are 
allowed &quot;do their part,&quot; and then the results are re-assembled by the 
master &quot;when its all over.&quot; [This is very different from the similar 
concept done at the CPU level on an instruction by instruction basis. 
We won't see N-way multi-processing at the CPU level until Power5 (or 
is it 6?) is released.]

This means that certain kinds of jobs are VERY suited to this kind of 
treatment. The individual pieces are both &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;substantial.&quot;  
An &quot;independent&quot; chunk of the problem can be carved off, isolated and 
still retain &quot;enough&quot; work to be done to make the process of carving it 
up (i.e. overhead) worth the effort.  Other types of jobs, however, 
really do need a &quot;bigger hammer.&quot;

This particular problem appears to be of the type that is quite 
borderline -- the problem can be carved up into sub-tasks, but the 
amount of work to be done by the sub-task is barely equal to the effort 
required to do the carving and setup work necessary to do the job.

Super Computing is a funny beast. It really is NOT what most people 
think it is. Every super computer in the world runs at virtually the 
same speed, (the speed of the unit processor) until whatever technique 
which makes that computer super kicks in, then it takes off. In the old 
days, we had vector processors and array processors just to name two 
styles of &quot;super computers.&quot; But you had to uniquely code and compile 
for each type of &quot;super&quot; so that you could utilize its effects. Each 
one was different and coding techniques which worked optimally for one 
scheme frequently caused slow-downs on the other!

The overall effect is not unlike a hydroplane boat -- the boat moves 
like any other boat until it gets up enough speed to sit back on its 
&quot;shoe&quot; and hydroplane ... then it's off like a rocket.  Or even a 
liquid fuel rocket... it takes a long time to build up enough thrust to 
get it moving, but eventually it can move very fast. Or consider 
&quot;overdrive&quot; (5th gear these days) in the automobile. The gear ratios 
present yield a very efficient transfer at speed ... but you can't use 
it to overcome inertia (i.e. start-up), when you need power, not speed.

Other than that... Yes. The memory system (as well as other components) 
can be tuned, and must be tuned if you want to optimize for a 
particular type of work. I haven't explored Free BSD, which Darwin is 
based upon, so I don't know what is available, but there are ways of 
tuning things -- just remember, that you will be boldly going where 
virtually no one else has any interest in going.  I would ask around on 
the FreeBSD lists for ideas. But again, you are moving into wizzard 
territory, beyond the area where any &quot;mere mortal&quot; cares to play. My 
guess is you will probably find 50 kindred souls in the US and maybe 
100 world-wide. (Another place to ask is the University of Virginia as 
well as Apple's own ACG - Advanced Computation group - 
www.apple.com/acg/ - my understanding is that Richard Crandall is quite 
&quot;approachable.&quot; He may be able to put you in touch with others in the 
rendering business.)

Remember -- OSX, like all versions of Unix(tm), is a general-purpose, 
time-sharing, operating system! No version of Unix(tm) supports 
&quot;real-time&quot; processing without taking specific actions to support RT. 
This is true of any operating system. Every thing sold by every vendor 
(including Linux) is &quot;optimized&quot; for general-purpose, time-sharing. 
This is why there are &quot;variants,&quot; such as &quot;Imbedded Linux&quot; or Palm or 
Symbian or that which runs your iPod (whose name I forget off hand). 
All these have features which make them &quot;undesirable&quot; for a consumer 
oriented OS, but VERY desirable for special purposes.

Until you've worked on a box which has only 4K of memory (yes K not M) 
you don't know what &quot;coding optimization&quot; means!
