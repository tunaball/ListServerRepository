This issue has been around since the beginning of &quot;interactive&quot; 
computing -- the IBM world (long before Microsoft, used the &quot;newline&quot; 
which was a composite character that did BOTH a carriage-return and a 
linefeed. Most common usage -- the good ol' 2741, aka IBM Selectric.
Which also harkens up some the TTY heritage of interactive usage.

As far as the Mac and OS X is concerned, the issue is actually one 
dependent upon your choice of editor.

The &quot;most rational&quot; of the command line editors -- emacs -- doesn't 
care. It will read either and switch to that &quot;mode&quot; or you can convert 
from one to the other. If you want a GUI editor that does the same 
thing, use BBedit. Even Apple's TextEdit can deal with the two by 
changing preferences to &quot;plain text.&quot; (RTF documents are 100% 
incompatible with Unix by definition. Their formating information is 
simply NOT &quot;plain text.&quot;)

The only time that the difference between Line-Feed and Carriage-Return 
becomes an issues is when you are using one of the command line display 
command -- cat. When used on a Carriage-Return file. (I think both 
&quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot; also do the conversion for you, but I don't have a 
file handy to test.)
