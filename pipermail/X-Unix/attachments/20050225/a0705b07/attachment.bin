The inode is the only chance you have to successfully refer to the
file. Using "find ... -exec rm {} ;", or "find ... | xargs rm" aren't
going to behave any differently than what you've already tried from
the command line.


That said, I would consider trying the following:

1. Boot into single-user mode.

2. Use ls -i to get the file's inode.

3. Use clri to clear the inode.

4. Use fsck to repair the filesystem OR perform a safe boot.

5. Perform a normal reboot.


Note that I have NOT tried using clri under OS X, but I assume that
since it's present, it has been integrated to work with HFS+
filesystems.


Good luck,

Michael
