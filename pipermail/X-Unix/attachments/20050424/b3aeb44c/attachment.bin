I did check their site out.  Found a few different Apache discussion
lists to check out. Not all were easy to search.


But, I was in an unrelated group chat today and found someone who was
pretty good at PERL and happened to know what I needed. Although not
PERL specific, he had the goods.


<excerpt>I typically have more success using google to search through
mailing lists

than the search tools some lists provide. For example, to search
throught

he archives for mod_perl information you could use the folloiwng query:


  mod_perl site:mail-archives.apache.org

Well, that's a pretty neat trick... Will have to remember that one...
