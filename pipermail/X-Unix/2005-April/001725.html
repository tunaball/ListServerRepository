	Authentication through the Mac OS X GUI is not routed via sudo, this 
is a common misconception. Whatever panel you see asking you for your 
admin password is plugging directly into the various security 
frameworks offered by the system (look in 
/System/Library/Frameworks/Security*), so the scope of this &quot;glitch&quot; is 
indeed rather limited. It is true that Apple *could* setup things 
differently to further limit this &quot;vulnerability&quot; (outputting to a more 
secure log file is quite reasonable), but trying to point this out as a 
Mac OS X specific vulnerability is rather absurd and pointless in my 
opinion. In any case, it could only be argued that Mac OS X is not 
*shipped* as secure as it could be, but the potential of being that 
secure is definitely there, already built into the system and into 
sudo.

	Most definitely a non-issue for the vast majority of people, again in 
my opinion. Regards,...
