So far, this is the first time I see such a thing. This list *is* 
professional usually, and I quite like how things go out here -- you get 
fast answers from knowledgable people. Mind you this is not a battle cry 
in order to defend the parties involved, it is one to defend the rest of 
the list -- which are, I believe, quite mature and professional people.

If you are going to put everyone on this list in the same basket, it 
shows that you don't seem to be any better than the &quot;infancy in the view 
of the net&quot; we seem to be in, Mr.Crist.

If I could be allowed to express my personal feelings, I say, let's move 
on. We have wasted enough time discussing this -- stuff like this should 
be discussed personally in private e-mails, or talk to the listmom. Oh well.

My two cents.
