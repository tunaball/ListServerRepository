<PRE>Well, I guess there you have it.  Stan Ulrich, I would like you to 
realize what a crybaby you've been regarding this entire issue.  In 
over 8 (that's eight) years of posting to many Unix mailing lists, I 
have NEVER gotten a complaint about email attachments.  
FreeBSD-Questions, a very prominent list, actually encourages some 
attachments, as they relate to the topic at hand.  This never seems to 
cause a problem there, and there are probably thousands of subscribers. 
  One of your messages to me came accross at 3.5 K.  That's a lot more 
than my little .2K attachment.

I was recommended to this list by a member of FreeBSD-Questions as a 
professional group of individuals.  I have, for the most part, 
concluded that this is not the case, in my opinion.  I would appear 
that there are some, enough, that are still in their infancy in the 
view of the 'net, and the professional community.

At this point, I'm going to bow out.  Whether I start my own list, or 
find another, I have yet to figure out, but I don't want to 'poison' 
this one for you folks.

Thanks for your time!
