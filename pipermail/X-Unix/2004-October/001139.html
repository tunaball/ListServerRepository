I sign my messages because there are many people out there who DO know 
me, and have my signature to verify against.  You don't end up in this 
community for many years without having people know you.  You're right, 
it's easy to not sign my messages.  My point is that I'm signing my 
messages by choice, not only that, but I _am_ currently using MacGPG, 
which _does_ have the ability to use MIME:application/pgp-signature 
attachments.  If you read up on the MacGPG site, they mention that 
there are many mailers out there that do not understand MIME 
attachments correctly, which I've already mentioned.

As far as the Apple support of MacGPG, I wish they would create a 
handler for mail encryption or other parsing type activity, similar to 
many unix mail clients such as Mutt, Pine, and Kmail.  If there was a 
specific API for that functionality, it would make life much easier in 
the development area for such plug-ins.
