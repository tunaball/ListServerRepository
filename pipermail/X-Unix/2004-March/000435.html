Switching from one computer to another is no different than moving from 
one house or apartment to another.

Consider:

Your &quot;old house&quot; has certain features - a clothes washer and dryer 
maybe. Your &quot;new house&quot; has the same features. But you lived in your 
old house for 5 years...
what's the difference?

The new washer and dryer are (theoretically) &quot;better&quot; -- more &quot;energy 
efficient,&quot; quieter.

Your old computer has iDVD version 1.0. Your new computer has iDVD 
version 4.0.

Similarly, your old house is full of the &quot;stuff&quot; you have collected for 
5 years. As you prepare to move to your new house, you &quot;pack up&quot; all of 
your old stuff -- you look at it, and decide &quot;keep or trash.&quot;  Some 
stuff you know is &quot;trash.&quot; Some stuff you know is &quot;keep.&quot; Other stuff 
is &quot;maybe,&quot; a bunch of stuff is &quot;what on earth is this?&quot; and another 
bunch of stuff is &quot;Gadzooks, I haven't opened this box since I moved 
into this house 5 years ago.&quot;

Your computer is no different.

Any upgrade is a tedious process -- even from one OS level to the next. 
There are certain things that &quot;stop working&quot; (trash); certain things 
that you have to convert (keep), and lots of stuff that still works, 
but you don't know for how long (maybe).

Scott's process is the sound way to do things -- but keep in mind that 
you don't have to limit your &quot;connectivity&quot; to FireWire. There are many 
ways to keep your &quot;old disks&quot; while migrating to &quot;new disks.&quot; (Although 
with many of the newer system FW is pretty much what you are limited 
to.)

The key is to actually look at, and understand, what you are doing.
