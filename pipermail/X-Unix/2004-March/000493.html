Incorrect.  Files (and directories) to be served by Apache need to be
readable by the Apache process.  For example, if you configure Apache to
run as user &quot;www&quot; and group &quot;www&quot;, then served content must be readable
by either the user &quot;www&quot; or anyone within the group &quot;www&quot;.

In a shared web server, a typical method is to make all users' web
directories group-readable by Apache, but also disallow all world privs.
Doing this keeps users from accessing each other's web content.

</I>:<i> are of course, readable by anyone.  This is fine in the case of html files,
</I>:<i> but when you get to server parsed files, such as those in php, there can be

Depends.  See below.

</I>
Actually, the only way for PHP to die is for the mod_php to crash in an
unexpected way or for Apache to crash.  Either way, the chances of the
PHP source code getting revealed is almost impossible (if the latter, it
*is* impossible).

:<i> The trouble I am having is I am able to read outside the current directly
</I>:<i> and traverse the entire files system with php using its abilities to read
</I>:<i> files.  I can not read files that apache does not have permission to read,
</I>:<i> but those that it does, I can.  For example, if I were to create a php file
</I>:<i> reading tool and tell it to go up one directory from my directory that holds
</I>:<i> all my web files, I would be in my root folder, up one more, and I would see

</I>:<i> could locate say, some file called conf.incl.php and in that I would see
</I>:<i> some connection data to a database, from there, I could delete data from the
</I>:<i> database.
</I>
If you set the User/Group properly as described above, then Apache will
not have access to these parent directories.

:<i> How do you prevent this?  I am sure since there are so many
</I>:<i> cheapPHPhosting.com type sites out there, this is either a problem they all
</I>:<i> have, or one they have figured out how to fix.
</I>
You can also try setting the PHP variable &quot;open_basedir&quot; on a per-vhost
basis.  A more secure solution is to set up a proper chroot'ed world per
user, but that's a bit of a pain.

:<i> What tradeoffs in inconvenience will I have to live with to offer shared
</I>:<i> hosting in a secure way?
</I>
This is a PHP issue, not an OS X issue.  You might try looking at the
official PHP docs in the security section, especially the user notes.
