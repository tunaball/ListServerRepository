The firmware I'm referring to is the SVEASOFT firmware. It's a
customized version of the firmware which includes dropbear(minimal ssh
daemon/client set) as well as a few other apps. I have it running on 2
WRT54G routers and they serve as &quot;lite&quot; servers. I've done the same to
a Buffalotech NAS storage unit(160GB) and use it as an RSYNC/CIFS/NFS
server.

Isn't customized firmware fun? ^_-

There are some tricks to uploading the firmware. I took a couple of
hours hitting several stores until I found the units(serial
code/production run) which would accept the firmware through a web
update.

The SVEASOFT firmware also let's you do other things like selective
port forwarding, QOS, port/trunk bonding, etc.

</I>
Well, either lynx or some scripting with curl. I use lynx since it's
easier for me to work with it. :) Nothing like a customized lynx+shell
script wrapper to auto-play a web based adventure game for you. ^_-

The SVEASOFT site allows for firmware downloads with a minimum
membership. It's a worthwhile effort as their code has made life ALOT
easier and my routers more useful.

Good luck!

Wing.
