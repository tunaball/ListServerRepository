<PRE>I bought a Kanguru drive that was advertised as having Mac 
compatibility.  It is only compatible after you call and find out you 
have to use the Dragon Burner software.  The software didn't come with 
the drive and it is being sent.  The drive won't work with iTunes or 
Apple's Disk Copy utility.

I downloaded the demo version of the Dragon Burner software and found 
that the CD-RW was actually an Artec WRR-52 drive.
www.artecusa.com

Looking at the manufacturers website I don't see that they make a 
firewire drive.

Now I'm thinking I have an EIDE drive in a firewire oxford-bridge box.  
Its pretty speedy, and only cost me $115.00, so far.

If the software that is being sent is only the demo version then I'll 
have to pay $49.00 for the full version.  So that's about $164.00 for 
this cheapo drive.

I finally found the compatibility chart on the apple site.  Most of 
these drives seem like eide drives going through an oxford bridge.  I'm 
guessing because of the lack of specificity on the spec sheets.  But at 
least I wouldn't have to buy more software.
www.apple.com/macosx/upgrade/storage.html

Here are my questions:

What is this difference?  I know that ide transfers data at 7800 KB/S 
and firewire moves it at 400 mbs.  What I want to know is,

How much more will I pay for a true Firewire CD-RW?
Is there such a thing?
Who makes them?
