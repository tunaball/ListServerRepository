<PRE>re:  ext. firewire drive not mounting, which used to before improper  
put away

Thanks to all for the suggestions, but I haven't gotten it mounted yet.
In a summary here's what I've tried.
Recall, the drive used to mount fine.
Any feedback more than welcome... (need drive mounted for project)
-Terry :o)

1. Booted in 9.2.2 :
	*drive doesn't mount
	*First Aid sees volume (which I named &quot;fw128&quot;) but doesn't let me  
diagnose or mount it
	*Drive Setup says its an unsupported drive, won't let me initialize  
&quot;unsupported&quot; drive.

2. 10.1.5 X
	* drive doesn't mount
	* tried cycling power on drive after OS startup
	* tried connecting drive before and after startup
	*tried USB cable (as my enclosure supports both USB and FW)
	*Disk Utility shows the drive, but it's volume (which should be  
&quot;fw128&quot;) has no name
		*cannot mount it
		*tried erasing, repartioning, all to no avail. Using extended  
formatting.
	*tied trashing any plists  &quot;fire&quot; and DiskUtility, to no avail
	*didn't reinstall Disk Utility, trying it on another mac (10.2.4)  
instead

2.  10.2.4
	tried all above, except did not delete any plists here.

Help very much appeciated!   :o)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My OS 10.1 system got locked up and I had to do the evil unplug of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The system is up and working great, but now I can't mount my Firewire

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I couldn't &quot;eject&quot; it properly before (similar to a power outage) but  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need get it to mount now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I looked at Disk Utility on 10.1 and saw a B-tree error, that would

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I checked out the disk on a 10.2 system and was able to repair the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> B-tree error but still couldn't mount the disk.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It was &quot;standard&quot; formatted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK ... so for this, I've given up on recovering the data and am  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to reformat the disk (on 10.2) to extended format.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now it seems the Apple Disk Utility is stuck in the &quot;Preparing drive  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... unmounting old volumes&quot; phase.  The blue bar is still animated  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;flowing&quot; , but seems to be stuck 3/4 the way though the process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Checked the processes using the &quot;top&quot; command in the Terminal.  Disk  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Utility is not locked up, as I see fluctuations in its usage of the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CPU.  Still... nothing has happened for a several minutes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GOAL:  I'm laying down lots of DV video to the drive to edit later. I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to have the drive be a reliable archive and not need to be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reformatted or lose data in case it gets unmounted improperly.
