Perhaps you have a cable problem?  Try a different cable for a few days 
and see if that makes a difference.

You might also check the power cable socket in the back of the drive.

You might also consult your sales slip and see whether the case/drives 
are still in warranty. Either way, check with tech. support and see 
what they suggest.

I have a couple of 120 GB Western Digital FW Drives that have separate 
power supplies. The plugs that go into the drive get loose and do some 
screwy things, such as keeping the green power light lit, but not 
providing power to spin up the drive.  I have had to replace two of the 
cases on two older WD (45 &amp; 60 GB) drives due to bad Firewire to ATA 
bridges.  Slipped the drives into new cases and they work fine.

I also have a PYRO case from ADS that apparently causes the drive 
inside to go to sleep without instructions from the computer, creating 
trouble on the chain of drives when I try to do something like open the 
drive window on the desktop, open or save a file to it.

My two other PYRO cases work fine.

Richard (Brown, I think) has said on the Mac DV list (also at 
themacinoshguy.com) that he's had mostly good luck and some sleep 
problems with the PYRO cases.

Hope this is helpful.
