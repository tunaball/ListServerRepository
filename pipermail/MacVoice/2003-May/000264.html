I DID notice that last part - and while it's &quot;a shame&quot; that I don't get 
to further improve my accuracy, I'd hardly expect to do so.

I'm not sure how you mean this...largely because that doesn't sound 
like what I'm trying to do.  You seem to be suggesting that I can't 
associate multiple mic settings w/ a given model - which I never even 
considered trying to hack together. Since VV seems to treat each voice 
model as a monolithic chunk, I suspect it would require program 
modifications to allow multiple mic settings per model.

What I want to do is different.

If I go into UserSettings, I see a pop-up w/ &quot;...first voice model&quot; 
selected, and options to add, modify, or rename it ('delete' is 
inactive).  I want to COPY that model - make a duplicate - and treat 
them as separate models, even though the hold the same data, much as 
one might duplicate a file &amp; handle the copy as if it was a separate 
document.  I want to label one of them LOUD, &amp; set the mic up for loud 
conditions...and label the other QUIET &amp; set the mic up for quiet 
conditions.  I would then select one or the other, and work with each 
independently from the other.

To repeat:  has anyone tried anything like this - and, if so, how did 
it work out for you?
