I can tell you that there are a fair number of Macintosh-using attorneys 
who use iListen from MacSpeech in their practices, and are quite happy 
with it.

However, it seems that your success with any speech recognition product 
is somewhat determined by how well your particular voice matches the 
model in the particular program that you are using, and also it is 
somewhat determined by how badly you want the program to work for you.  

The latter point involves training the program.  If you read a 15 minute 
story to the program to train it, try it, and then decide that it doesn't 
work well enough for you and give up, that's one thing.  If you continue 
from there, and keep on correcting errors that the program makes 
interactively, eventually the program will probably attain a high 
recognition rate for you.

So, I don't usually recommend the product to folks who weren't interested 
in speech recognition/transcription in the first place.  It's sort of 
like suggesting learning to ride a bicycle to a child who has no interest.
