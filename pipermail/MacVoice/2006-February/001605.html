<PRE>
Margaret (and everyone else):

Normally, I would recommend questions like this be directed to our  
Support department (<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/macvoice.html">questions at macspeech.com</A>). I will give very brief  
answers here, for the benefit of everyone, since the question was  
asked on the list - but for more complete info, please contact our  
support department (and please do not be offended by the brevity of  
my remarks):
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, when I have the correction window open and there's a list of  
</I>&gt;<i> words to
</I>&gt;<i> choose from, my question is, after I click the right word (or type  
</I>&gt;<i> in the
</I>&gt;<i> word he means) is this a &quot;saved&quot; correction so that when the  
</I>&gt;<i> program hears
</I>&gt;<i> that word in the future, it will get it right?  Also, how does the  
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> correction option of &quot;What I say&quot; work?  I reviewed the manual, but  
</I>&gt;<i> it's not
</I>&gt;<i> clear.
</I>
Dictate. Say &quot;Correct That.&quot; Highlight a word or phrase in the left  
part of the Correction window (where your text is), and choose the  
correct or phrase from the choice list on the right by clicking the  
number next to it. If the correct choice does not exist, type it into  
the Choice One field, then press the &quot;1&quot; button. When you are  
finished correcting, press the &quot;Done&quot; button. Say &quot;Commit  
Corrections&quot; to make changes to your profile.

&gt;<i> Second, what's the difference between &quot;Update This Window&quot; and  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Update All
</I>&gt;<i> Windows&quot;?
</I>
This becomes more apparent if you try the following:

1). Open a document (in TextEdit, for example) and dictate some text.

2). Open a second document. Dictate some more text.

3). Go back to the first document and make corrections, but do NOT  
say &quot;Commit Corrections&quot; after pressing the &quot;Done&quot; button.

4). Make corrections in the second document.

5). Say &quot;Commit Corrections.&quot; OK - do you want to apply adjustments  
to your profile for corrections made in just the active (second)  
document (window) or all windows?

Rarely would you update just one window, but sometimes you may have  
an instance where, upon reflection, you don't want to update your  
profile with changes made in other documents.

&gt;<i> Third, when does the &quot;save&quot; actually take place?  When I restart the
</I>&gt;<i> program?
</I>
Adjusting your profile happens whenever you say &quot;Commit Corrections.&quot;  
If you never say &quot;Commit Corrections,&quot; the program will ask when you  
close a document, or when you quit a program (or it will  
automatically apply your adjustments) depending on how your  
preferences are set. See &quot;Updating Your Profile&quot; on page 23 of the  
iListen User Guide, which is accessible from the Help menu when  
iListen is the active application.

&gt;<i> Fourth, under the learn my writing style, what format/application  
</I>&gt;<i> will that
</I>&gt;<i> open?  Where do I get the sample from?
</I>
Plain Text. Anything you have written. If an email, copy the text and  
paste it into a TextEdit document. In Word, you would have to save  
the document as Text Only (or, you could also select the text and  
paste it into a TextEdit document).

&gt;<i> I know that I'll need him to reread the samples, but I was hoping  
</I>&gt;<i> to invest
</I>&gt;<i> the time on the corrections window so that it would work without  
</I>&gt;<i> getting him
</I>&gt;<i> involved again.
</I>
Take a look at the Training Guide (also available from the Help menu)  
for tips. You may also want to browse through our online  
Knowledgebase for a bunch of helpful info:
