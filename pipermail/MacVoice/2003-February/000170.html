<PRE>Jonathan (and everyone else):

&gt;<i> thanks for the feedback. This solution is what I sort of figured it 
</I>&gt;<i> was the way to do this, but I was hoping for something a little more 
</I>&gt;<i> simple. It would be great if we can just simply state &quot;do this&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> have the computer respond as if we had pressed the keys without having 
</I>&gt;<i> to create a script. I wonder if there's anything like that the works 
</I>&gt;<i> for future versions of iListen?
</I>
I can't say for sure what is on tap for iListen (or ViaVoice or 
PlainTalk), since I am not employed by MacSpeech (or IBM or Apple), but 
I can tell you that a lot of the problem has to do with the OS itself. 
There needs to be a &quot;communicator&quot; between the program and the OS that 
translates what the user is asking. That communicator is a script. All 
three programs have the capability of creating these scripts. With 
iListen it is a bit more difficult than either IBM (their KSD editor 
makes creating spoken shortcuts a breeze), and PlainTalk has a similar 
mechanism.

Of the three, PlainTalk actually comes the closest to what you want - 
but even with it, the command must still be created before it can be 
used. I don't think that is going to change any time soon.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way... I switched to iListen today, after using via voice for 
</I>&gt;<i> the last week (I actually used in many months ago as well) and can't 
</I>&gt;<i> believe the difference in how well iListen responds on my computer. 
</I>&gt;<i> The only real thing viavoice has over iListen is integration of 
</I>&gt;<i> command and dictation in a relatively seamless manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Glad you are finding iListen useful. I know that different people have 
vastly different experiences with the two programs.

Best Regards to all,


Chuck Rogers
