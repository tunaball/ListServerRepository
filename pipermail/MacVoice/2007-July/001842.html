<PRE>All:

We have an exclusive opportunity for all MacVoice mailing list  
subscribers. This is NOT a public opportunity, btw.

MacSpeech is preparing version 1.7.1 for beta testing. Version 1.7.1  
has already passed the first phase of testing, but we are about to  
release the beta 2 version, and would like to expand the number of  
beta testers.

Before you get all excited, there are some specific things we are  
looking for:

- You MUST have a MacSpeech-certified microphone. Version 1.7.1 does  
not change the fact that iListen works better with microphones that  
are well-suited for Mac OS X.

- We'd like a bunch of people testing who have already installed the  
Safari 3.0 beta.

- We'd like a bunch of people testing who have already installed Mac  
OS X 10.4.10

(There are specific issues with Mac OS X 10.4.10 and the Safari 3.0  
beta we are addressing with this release.)

- If you have access to a beta of Leopard, that is a bonus, but not  
required. We aren't specifically testing for beta compatibility with  
this release, but it doesn't hurt to run it through the ringer.

If you have read this far and are still interested, then read the  
following very carefully:

1). If you already own iListen, and meet the above requirements, go  
to <A HREF="http://www.macspeech.com/beta/">http://www.macspeech.com/beta/</A> and fill out the form. IMPORTANT!!  
In the Comment field, indicate you already have iListen tell us which  
MacSpeech-certified microphone you have, and whether or not you have  
Mac OS X 10.4.10 and/or the Safari 3.0 beta installed. IF YOU DO NOT  
LEAVE A COMMENT AS REQUESTED YOU WILL NOT BE CHOSEN TO BETA TEST.

2). If you DO NOT own iListen, but you meet the above requirements,  
go to <A HREF="http://www.macspeech.com/beta/">http://www.macspeech.com/beta/</A> and fill out the form.  
IMPORTANT!! In the Comment field, indicate you DO NOT have iListen  
AND indicate which MacSpeech-certified microphone you have as well as  
whether or not you have Mac OS X 10.4.10 and/or the Safari 3.0 beta  
installed.(If you intend on purchasing a microphone, you can purchase  
one from our store and use the coupon code &quot;10-HEAD&quot; to get 20% off  
any of the head-worn microphones we sell. Put the order number in the  
comment field.)  IF YOU DO NOT LEAVE A COMMENT AS REQUESTED YOU WILL  
NOT BE CHOSEN TO BETA TEST.

Your ability to a). follow the instructions above and b). read and  
agree to the beta agreement at <A HREF="http://www.macspeech.com/beta/">http://www.macspeech.com/beta/</A> will  
determine whether or not you will be accepted into the beta program.  
It is very important we get good reporting back from our beta  
testers. The quality of iListen depends on it. So I am going to  
suggest if you are like me, and tend to scan your emails, go back and  
read this message from the top very carefully if you are at all  
interested in beta testing for us.

Please do not share this invitation with anyone outside the list. Our  
beta test process is carefully controlled so we can insure the best  
possible outcome.



Best Regards,

Chuck Rogers, Chief Evangelist
MacSpeech, Inc.
