My situation is a little bit different.  I immediately noticed, when I
started using voice recognition software for &quot;creative writing&quot;, that I
found a great block not from speaking, but from visually looking at the
screen as the words appeared. As I watched the the words appear on the
screen - often with recognition errors - then the natural instinct was to
start focusing on fixing the errors etc. - and all the sudden I realized
that I  lost the flow of  my &quot; creative writing &quot;.

The simple solution for me: as I was speaking my &quot; creative writing &quot; -  I
simply either closed my eyes - or made sure that my eyes were not focused on
the screen. Then, when I had completed my thoughts, I would go back later
and edit the printed words.

As far as speaking itself:  you might try reorientation exercises - where
you might &quot; practice &quot; writing through speech recognition -  by writing
stuff for exercise only purposes - stuff you really don't care too much
about... Just for practice...


 Hope this helps - Dave
