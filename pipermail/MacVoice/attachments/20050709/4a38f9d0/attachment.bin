I gave up on Via-Voice after the same problems with later versions of
Panther.  Wasted a <underline>lot</underline> of time trying to make
it work, scansoft help service said they could not advise any date for
upgrade to work with later 10.3 (they seemed to have given-up on it). 
Despair turned to relief on discovering iListen.  It does what it says
on the box and support is good and on-going (relief turning to joy). 
My via-voice supplied mic worked with iListen and I haven't looked
back (except to trash Via-Voice). I note your Via-Voice worked with
Tiger, but I won't be bothering with it again.  Shame on Scansoft, I
used to use Naturally Speaking on a PC for years and my confidence in
them has now been destroyed.
