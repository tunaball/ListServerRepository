<PRE>No I have not tried and everything below is true you could try running 
VPC as your OS without OSX or 9 behind it.  I have some notes on this 
from OS9.  I will include these at the bottom after all the quotes.

VPC as an OS on a MAC in OS9

Subject: [SM] S900 &amp; Virtual PC


Yeah I've running VPC (v3.0) on both my Umax s900/G3 360 and Apple 
G4/400
The speed is much better on the G4, more than twice as fast.
   ( I wonder why?? cause the differences isnt so much normally)
Tried a bit og gaming, conclusion: Starcraft is running smoother on
my friends Pentium2 266then the umax g3

There is no 3d card support either.
The video is an emulated S3 Trio card and you are using you ram as
vram (from 1-4 megs)

EXCEPTv3.0 version who support voodoo cards. I havent tried it, but
it's stated in the manual.
The support is dropped in version 4, because of incompablilities i 
think.
(Mine is equipped with a rage 128 16 mb)

If you need to REALLY run Windows at it's fastest on your Mac, do
this with VPC:
On another partition (or HD) create a bare bones System
(sorry, without another partition, this will not work),
remove EVERY extension except the Appearance extension, and every
control panel except the Appearance control panel.  Then move the VPC
preference file into the new System's preference folder.  Also move
the VirtualPC app itself into the System folder. Remove the Finder
from the System, throw it in the trash and delete it.  Use ResEdit to
change the VPC app's 'creator' code to MACS and 'type' to FNDR. Then
rename VirtualPC=81 to Finder.  Then reboot holding down
&quot;Shift-Option-Command-Delete&quot;, this will force your Mac to boot from
a System other than your startup disk.
!!DO NOT CHANGE THE STARTUP DISK IN THE STARTUP DISK CONTROL PANEL!!
If you do, it will be murder trying to get it to boot back to MacOS.
Now what you have is Windows booting instead of MacOS, and the
performance increase is more than double!  Alas, you will not be able
to use the MacOS while you are running VPC like this, but you WILL
still be able to share ANY Mac folder!, but if you NEED to use Win,
this is the best way to do it!
Now to get back to the MacOS, just quite VPC as normal, saving it
where you left off, and then once it has saved the data to the disc,
you just force-restart &quot;Control-Command-PowerKey&quot;, and your Mac will
safely boot back to MacOS.
BTW, all networking is STILL available from the PC using it this way,
it's great!

Anyway remember to give vpc a lot of memory and set its video memory
size to max (4megs)
WIndows 95 runs also speedier then win 98  (havent tried  2000)

Dan

What setup are you running 10.1 on your Umax??? What video card do you
have?? I know you can get OSx to run on Umax's, but for me, its not
worth it as I dont have an ATI video card, I have a Voodoo 5 5500, and
my system runs great with it. I really dont want to have to shell out
more money for a video card just to run OSX on my Umax, when it would be
more beneficial to splurge on a dual G4 Mac and get som serious
performance!! =)
