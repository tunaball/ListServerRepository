<PRE>All:

For those of you who don't know me, I worked for MacSpeech for the  
best part of the past decade before being laid off when they  
restructured earlier this year. Before that, I worked at Apple in  
their developer relations department. While I would have to agree with  
most of what Arnie proposes, I can tell you that no developer working  
on software this complex can give any sort of commitment to a  
guaranteed (or even suggested, for that matter) timeline.

Making software is not like building a house, where you know what  
materials you will need and the time it will take to build it in  
advance. There might be several ways to solve a problem, and sometimes  
there may be only one. You are always dependent on the resources given  
to you in the operating system, and if the resources you need don't  
exist, you have to build them yourself. When you build resources  
yourself, you run the risk of those resources becoming non-functional  
when the operating system is changed by its owner.

In short, getting something like this to work involves a lot of work  
and a lot of trial an error in order to discover which one of any  
number of methods offer the least amount of problems, since it is very  
rare in software development to find a path that has no problems  
whatsoever.

The fact that they don't communicate is a reflection of their current  
corporate policy, which focuses resources inward on getting updates to  
their users absolutely as fast as possible. I can't say I agree with  
that policy, but I do know that no information from them does not mean  
they aren't hard at work.

Chuck Rogers
