<PRE>It's a matter of sizzle &amp; steak, IMHO, Gavin. Yes, you *can* dictate into almost any application, and if you take the time to learn (and then observe) the additional rules required for doing so, you should be fine. In marketing the program, &quot;can&quot; and &quot;should&quot; are two different things. It's the sizzle that sells the steak, but its the steak that fills you up. In the case of Dictate, the sizzle is that you CAN dictate into any application, but the steak is that it is so bloody accurate in the Notepad, and the bonus is you don't have to observe the other rules (don't type and talk, select words only by voice, etc.)

I tend to be less verbose in my MV replies due to the size restriction, but suffice it to say, Dictate does work as advertised. I am only suggesting it will work better - and with less effort on the user's part in terms of having to learn certain commands - if you dictate into Notepad. For short replies such as email or an IM, direct dictation is fine. But for more lengthy things, I think everyone will get better results in the Notepad. Again, IMHO.

&gt;<i> In which case, Chuck, Nuance really shouldn't be advertising it as able to dictate into any application that can accept text input. European consumer protection law is quite strict about this sort of thing: we do not have &quot;caveat emptor&quot; here, we have &quot;it must be as advertised and fit for the purpose sold, or you will be paying big fines&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I have been absolutely stunned at the accuracy of the previous version when dictating into its Notepad: I consistently get 99%+ accuracy (and am surprised at some of the words that I presume are in its dictionary! &quot;Kramer&quot; anybody?). And I'm using a desktop mike through a USB hub...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For best results, always dictate into the Notepad, then copy and paste the text where you want it. Yes, I know this is a bit of a pain, but you gain two HUGE advantages (and one small one):

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - your dictation will be a bit more accurate, since the program can take full advantage of the computer's processor to do its work (instead of having to share processor time with another program, which by default in Mac OS X gets most of the processor's attention)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2 - Big KNOWN BUGS with spellcheckers in apps! If you dictate into basic applications such as Dragon Notepad or text edit - the program works great. However, if you dictate into an application that uses spellcheckers or also incorporates macro makers such as quickeys, it falls apart with this giant bug: at the end of a phrase the last two characters of the word will often randomly be reversed due to some incompatibility with spell checkers. EX : spellcheckesr - go to the stoer - things like thsi ....
