<PRE>Hello folks,

I went ahead and got the upgrade of Dragon Dictate 2.0.

I spoke to the tech folks prior to upgrading, and they mentioned that after backing up my older version profile, I would just install the new version and then choose to import the older profile.

The basic installation of the application went well. And I did the upgrade of the voice profile easily. And then I had to train the profile. One of the bigger issues for me is that I had saved lots of text macro commands from my older profile. Unfortunately many of these did not work correctly. And I tried lots of various things to try to get them working. I was not real Happy about that.

Today I spoke to another tech person again, and we both agreed that it might be best to NOT import an old profile, as he said he has seen a few problems with that process, and rather start a brand-new fresh profile, after exporting my previous commands, and then import just the commands from the old profile instead.

So, I did this. After exporting my global text commands, I quit the program and restarted it and create the new profile along with new training. When I was done with this, I closed the program and backed it up&#8211;and then restarted it. When I looked at the command's area I expected it to be empty&#8211;since this was a new profile&#8211;however all my commands were in there. ODD.

Anyway, after a bit of fooling around&#8211;everything started working quite well&#8211;including my text macro commands.

So my recommendation&#8211;is to start a new profile rather than importing an old profile. 

I can say that this new version is working very well and for me, well worth the upgrade.

BIG SPELLING CHECKER BUG

Here is an example of me dictating directly into the Apple Mail program (with spell check on)...

For me, the one big drawback is that Dragon dictate&#8211;either the new version or the old version does not seem to work at all well when there is a spellign checker active within the program.  In my case, most of my prograsm have some kind of spelling checker, so this makes things quite limitin in terms of the various programs to dictate int.o 

 As I dictaet, every time I have a paues, it will  often reverse the last two characters of the last word that I speak, and this is very odd and hard to work with.  I think this is just a sill (silly) bug that they should be able to work out, because with modern softwaer, many applications will haev spelling checkre . 

another isseu that I might be having si random words appearing, often during silent momenst.  possibly working with the microphone volume settings might improve things over time, although lowering it today did not help

BTW:  All these reverse spelling issues go awya if their spellcheckre is turned off. Again, I hope they are able to fix thsi problem soon.





I'd love to hear anyone else's experiences with the new version.
