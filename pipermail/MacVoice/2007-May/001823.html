<PRE>Chuck,

Your assertion is ridiculous and you ought to know it. Dragon has had  
the ability to successfully intermingle commands and dictation from  
the beginning. It does NOT cause problems since the commands are  
generally carefully defined and, in 99% of cases, consist of more  
than one word. The example you give would not result in the computer  
trying to go to sleep as there would not be a pause before the  
&quot;command&quot; and so it would be recognised as a continuation of the  
dictation.

I recall having long discussions about this sort of thing when we  
were trying to get a French version going. French requires good  
context sensitivity, which iListen lacks. I don't know whether that  
is a limitation of the engine or if it comes from a programming  
decision you guys made early on, but it is at the root of these  
problems. With good context recognition, commands can be integrated  
into dictation without problem.
