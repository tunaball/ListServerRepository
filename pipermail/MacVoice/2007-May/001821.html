<PRE>Ian (and everyone else):

As Joe pointed out, having commands intermingled in dictation mode  
could cause huge problems. While there will be improvements, the only  
way I see commands being integrated is if there is a trigger word in  
front of the command. Even that could cause problems, however.  
Imaging you are dictating the phrase &quot;when I told my computer to go  
to sleep&quot; and the trigger word is &quot;computer.&quot; You wouldn't want your  
computer to go to sleep in the middle of a dictation session!

There will always be something to &quot;get used to.&quot; If you have commands  
integrated into dictation you will be even more restricted as to what  
you can say for commands, since those commands will have to be  
structured in such a way that they are less likely to be mistaken for  
a phrase you want to dictate. This can present a very unnatural way  
of using the computer, since those phrases would likely be harder to  
remember.

As it is, you can always say &quot;one shot command&quot; in iListen and it  
will go into Command Mode for one command - so the very next thing  
you say after &quot;one shot command&quot; will be interpreted as an action  
instead of typed out. This may give you what you are looking for - or  
at least get you closer.




Best Regards,

Chuck Rogers, Chief Evangelist
