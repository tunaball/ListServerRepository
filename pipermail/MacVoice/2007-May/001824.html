<PRE>Gavin:

We have heard from many professionals who use Dragon that its command  
recognition is much better when commands are isolated. We do know  
that Dragon has had many more years to work on their product than we  
have, and therefore would expect commands to work somewhat better  
because of that. But our basic premise remains the same: what I wrote  
is not at all &quot;ridiculous&quot; and we have comments from many avid Dragon  
users to back us up. That having been said, I am not disputing that  
your experience seems to be different.

The issue with French and iListen does not have to do with context  
sensitivity, btw, but with the fact that we have not found a way to  
get the Philips engine and Mac OS X to play nice together. It has  
nothing to do with any programming decisions we made, but rather this  
incompatibility.

</I>&gt;<i> Your assertion is ridiculous and you ought to know it. Dragon has  
</I>&gt;<i> had the ability to successfully intermingle commands and dictation  
</I>&gt;<i> from the beginning. It does NOT cause problems since the commands  
</I>&gt;<i> are generally carefully defined and, in 99% of cases, consist of  
</I>&gt;<i> more than one word. The example you give would not result in the  
</I>&gt;<i> computer trying to go to sleep as there would not be a pause before  
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;command&quot; and so it would be recognised as a continuation of  
</I>&gt;<i> the dictation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recall having long discussions about this sort of thing when we  
</I>&gt;<i> were trying to get a French version going. French requires good  
</I>&gt;<i> context sensitivity, which iListen lacks. I don't know whether that  
</I>&gt;<i> is a limitation of the engine or if it comes from a programming  
</I>&gt;<i> decision you guys made early on, but it is at the root of these  
</I>&gt;<i> problems. With good context recognition, commands can be integrated  
</I>&gt;<i> into dictation without problem.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> word in front of the command. Even that could cause problems,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however. Imaging you are dictating the phrase &quot;when I told my

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wouldn't want your computer to go to sleep in the middle of a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dictation session!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There will always be something to &quot;get used to.&quot; If you have  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commands integrated into dictation you will be even more  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restricted as to what you can say for commands, since those  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commands will have to be structured in such a way that they are  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> less likely to be mistaken for a phrase you want to dictate. This  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can present a very unnatural way of using the computer, since  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those phrases would likely be harder to remember.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As it is, you can always say &quot;one shot command&quot; in iListen and it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will go into Command Mode for one command - so the very next thing  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you say after &quot;one shot command&quot; will be interpreted as an action  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead of typed out. This may give you what you are looking for -  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or at least get you closer.
