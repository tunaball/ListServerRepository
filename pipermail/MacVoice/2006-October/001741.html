<PRE>Richard:

I have replied privately to your issues.

This is the first email we have received from you, and we are getting  
many emails each day - so I can't explain why your other email(s) did  
not reach us. We did have a temporary problem over a month ago with  
email, but have had no reports of anyone having problems since then.

For the benefit of everyone else on the list, MacSpeech is a  
geographically diverse company with employees all over the United  
States. Because of this, there is only one person in a physical  
location to take sales calls (and only one to take support calls).  
This means the voice mail can and does pile up, especially during the  
weekends. This is also our busy season, so it can sometimes take 5  
days or more before you will get a response to a voice mail. You will  
always receive a much faster response from us via email (assuming we  
get it, of course).
