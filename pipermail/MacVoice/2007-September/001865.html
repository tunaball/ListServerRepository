<PRE>Chuck, each word you have to add and correct takes a finite time to  
do (I took a ballpark figure of 4 minutes). Worse, each new term  
breaks the dictation rhythm which further adds to the lost time.

Dragon (Scansoft, Nuance...) has a vocabulary that is a bit of a  
catch-all. If so many doctors are using or are interested in iListen  
then having a series of very specialised vocabularies makes sense:  
one for cardiology, one for urology etc. Each would be between 500  
and 1200 words.

Apart from the lack of a French version, the most frequent reason I  
hear for not buying iListen is &quot;lack of specialised vocabularies&quot;.  
(And I'm not just talking medical here, lawyers and others need 'em.)

To counter your Gainesville example: I had a DNS client, a lawyer,  
who swore by DNS. I told him about iListen when he was thinking of  
moving to Mac and tried to do a little evangelism for MacSpeech. He  
did a little maths: it would cost him at least CHF 4800 in lost  
billable time to get enough samples into iListen and run through a  
few pages of dictation to get started. For that money, he could buy  
the DNS Legal, have quite a bit of change, and still have most of his  
billable hours... *That* is the mentality you're up against: these  
people make very good money, so price isn't much of an object, time  
(and therefore convenience) is.
