<PRE>Not true.

We have a doctor in Gainesville. He added words as he went. It did  
not take him 130 hours to add 1800 words. Not even close. He insists  
he didn't even notice the process. He added the word using Correction  
or Learn My Writing Style, iListen learned it.

ScriptPaks add dozens - sometimes hundreds - of commands for a given  
application at a very low price: $10 - $50. Since those commands are  
used only when iListen is in Command Mode, accuracy is not an issue.  
Medical terms require not just adding them, but also learning them in  
the context in which they are used and learning the way the user says  
them so they are accurately recognized and typed correctly as opposed  
to the other 300,000+ words (or even the other 14,999 words in the  
vocabulary).

The medical professionals who use iListen on a daily basis insist  
that iListen learned their individual words more quickly this way.

Just like you cannot understand our reluctance to add a vocabulary, I  
can't understand anyone's willingness to add yet another 14,000 or so  
terms to their vocabulary they will never use.

We fully understand that there will always be people who prefer a  
specialized vocabulary, just as there are those who would prefer an  
embedded text editor. Who knows? At some point in the future, we may  
relent - but as long as MacSpeech continues to grow and we get such  
positive comments from our users - including medical professionals -  
we will continue on the path we are on. It just makes sense to keep  
doing what you are doing if you are successful at it.


Best Regards,

Chuck Rogers, Chief Evangelist
MacSpeech, Inc.
