In iListen (specifically in the speech engine which is licensed by  
MacSpeech), &quot;paragraph&quot; is a predefined word that types two return  
characters, it is not a command. &quot;New Paragraph&quot; is also a word and  
types the same characters. The difference between a word and a  
command is that words can be corrected. Thus you can correct  
&quot;Paragraph&quot; to spell out the word instead of typing the returns. I  
run into the same problem with &quot;Line&quot; vs. &quot;New Line&quot;. It's annoying,  
but iListen does eventually start recognizing it as a word at least  
some of the time.

I agree that a word editor that allows deletion of problematic words  
would be very helpful in these situations. It would be great to be  
able to get rid of words that you don't use but show up  
inconveniently often in recognition. Also it would be nice to be able  
to delete words you added by accident (misspelled words or other word  
entry errors).
