<PRE>All:

I'm sorry, but I really need to jump in here. I tried to keep my  
mouth shut, but I just can't.

Neither IBM or Nuance has any intention of modifying ViaVoice, and I  
have yet to hear from anyone who can get it to work on an Intel Mac.  
The last update of ViaVoice was April of 2003 - over 3 years ago!

Meanwhile, we have been busting our arses for the past 6 years and,  
by all accounts have (some time ago, actually) finally surpassed  
ViaVoice in accuracy - we were ALWAYS better in terms of command and  
control. Since April of 2003 we have issued multiple updates AND kept  
up with changes in the Mac OS. If you accept the fact that speech  
recognition is also more prone to issues than any other type of  
software you are likely to use on your computer, our set up and use  
is also relatively hassle-free in comparison to ViaVoice.

I really appreciate the fact that many of you have established  
profiles in ViaVoice, I really do. But even NY Times Columnist David  
Pogue - who is an avid NatruallySpeaking fanatic - reported (in the  
NY Times) that he was able to get almost 96 percent accuracy after  
using the latest version for only 30 minutes!

So, let me ask: what is it going to take to get y'all to switch to  
the ONLY speech recognition software that is GUARANTEED to work on  
current Macs, from a company that continues to develop and support  
it? Let me know, and I will do my best to provide it if it is at all  
in my power. (Keep in mind that at some point, you will have to  
switch anyway - when you get an Intel Mac).


Best Regards,

Chuck Rogers, Chief Evangelist
MacSpeech, Inc.
