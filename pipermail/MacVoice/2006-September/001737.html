Thank you Chuck for your continued help. Previous to the VXi Parrott I owned
end earlier model of some VXi mike -  not sure which model - roughly the
same - and I have both of them side-by-side right now -  and I am noticing
that the Parrott  plastic piece that meets the metal head band is quite a
bit thicker ( so hopefully it is sturdier) than the previous model  ...
Which eventually broke - rendering the Mike fairly useless - even after I
tried to repair it with tape.

</I>&gt;<i> That having been said, the Plantronics .Audio 85 is a folding
</I>&gt;<i> microphone that performed as well as the standard microphone we ship
</I>&gt;<i> with iListen and almost as good as the VXi TalkPro. It is built for
</I>&gt;<i> portability (and it is stereo, so it work's great on iPods, too!).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding BlueTooth, we have yet to find a BlueTooth microphone that
</I>&gt;<i> will work with iListen. All of them we have tested have an 8kHz
</I>&gt;<i> sampling rate and iListen needs at least 16kHz to get good accuracy.
</I>&gt;<i> We are working with VXi to try to come up with a solution involving
</I>&gt;<i> their recently introduced BlueParrott, but so far we have nothing
</I>&gt;<i> positive to report.
