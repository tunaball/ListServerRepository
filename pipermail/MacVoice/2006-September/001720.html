<PRE>Chuck:

I'm a ViaVoice user, but am considering buying an Intel Mac. The main  
reason I haven't so far is that I'm a physician  and use IBM's  
Medical Dictionary (not available from ScanSoft, who obviously have  
no investment in continuing to support VV). As a (sub)specialist,  
I've had to create a large (&gt; 2500 word) custom vocabulary that I've  
trained over 3 or 4 years.

However, I'm keen to try iListen, because if I could get it to work  
better for me than VVwith no more than a weekend of  effort, I'd go  
for it, so that I could upgrade to a new Mac.

Iif iListen is really better than VV at recognition as you claim, why  
not offer a 30-day free trial version, or an inexpensive upgrade path  
from ViaVoice so that users like myself can check iListen out at low  
risk?

Thanks,

- Robert

</I>&gt;<i> AND kept up with changes in the Mac OS. If you accept the fact that  
</I>&gt;<i> speech recognition is also more prone to issues than any other type  
</I>&gt;<i> of software you are likely to use on your computer, our set up and  
</I>&gt;<i> use is also relatively hassle-free in comparison to ViaVoice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really appreciate the fact that many of you have established

</I>&gt;<i> David Pogue - who is an avid NatruallySpeaking fanatic - reported  
</I>&gt;<i> (in the NY Times) that he was able to get almost 96 percent  
</I>&gt;<i> accuracy after using the latest version for only 30 minutes!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, let me ask: what is it going to take to get y'all to switch to  
</I>&gt;<i> the ONLY speech recognition software that is GUARANTEED to work on  
</I>&gt;<i> current Macs, from a company that continues to develop and support  
</I>&gt;<i> it? Let me know, and I will do my best to provide it if it is at  
</I>&gt;<i> all in my power. (Keep in mind that at some point, you will have to  
</I>&gt;<i> switch anyway - when you get an Intel Mac).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Amazing -- they're now working again! Seems to be related to the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order of my user commands: if I start SpeakPad, then say, &quot;What

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sometimes only a partial suite, with only the &quot;Menu  Commands&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
