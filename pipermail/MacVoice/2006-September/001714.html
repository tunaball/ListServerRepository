<PRE>Chuck;

As a dual platform user I must respectfully disagree strongly.   
Although I give iListen an edge in mousing with MouseAywhere over  
grid and other options in DNS, the other two statements are patently  
untrue.  Proper name and possessive recognition alone are infinitely  
better in DNS, both out of the box and with training, and command and  
control integrated into all dictation is seamless without  
transitioning between two vocabularies.  Then when you look at  
command and control in browsers, well, they are not even on the same  
planet.

I am a diehard Mac user and strong proponent of iListen and continued  
development of SR for Macs.  I use my Mac for 95% of my workload, but  
the simple fact iListen does not recognize nor offer correction  
options of my last name capitalized (Maples) after every conceivable  
training, teaching, and correction in addition to issues mentioned  
with inconsistent ability to get words like period or paragraph  
(slightly better in 1.7, but still not great) to spell out handicap  
its performance considerably.

Since I have used many products successfully for many years on both  
platforms and still do to this day as well as having been a  
professional trainer for Voc Rehab and being married to a  
quadriplegic dependent on SR, I feel I have unique experience on this  
topic.  I do not bash iListen for limitations due to OS issues,  
speech engine limitations or a shorter development history, but to  
say iListen surpasses DNS in any area (except my penchant for  
MouseAnywhere)  has no merit in my 12 years of experience with SR.
