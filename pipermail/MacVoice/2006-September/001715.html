<PRE>Valerie:

Thanks for your email.

My comments were in general, not specifics. iListen will indeed learn  
regarding possessives, and anything iListen can do in a browser,  
iListen can do - although you may have to write some of the scripts  
yourself to do it.

I would never presume to compare an out of the box iListen to an out  
of the box Dragon NaturallySpeaking. Not today, anyway. We have a  
long way to go before I would even be willing to submit to such a  
comparison.

But, if you AREN'T a dual-platform user and you ARE a Mac user - or  
you are simply willing and able to put in the extra work it takes to  
get iListen up to where things are &quot;out of the box&quot; with Dragon, then  
my comments stand true - again, in general.

There are trade offs. Dragon gives you complete speech control over  
itself. Because of some technical limitations in the Mac OS, we can't  
do that (we are working on partial control, however and we will  
continue to work on full control for a future version).

Please do not read anything into my comments that aren't there, and  
don't put words into my mouth or thoughts in my head (its  crowded  
enough in there already). In summary, I would submit iListen is  
better than ViaVoice in every way, which is what started this thread  
- accuracy, command and control, everything. Regarding Dragon, if you  
are willing to work, iListen can equal Dragon in most cases. In the  
remaining areas where iListen falls short (such as voice control of  
itself), it makes up for it in other areas (as with its ability to  
offer virtually complete control of any application and the Mac OS  
through scripting). Regarding scripting, you have to pay $800 for  
Dragon to get anything close to what iListen offers you for $99.

Best Regards,

Chuck Rogers
