<PRE>&gt;<i>I am running OS 10.2.3 and ViaV 10.2.2. I have had little or no problem
</I>&gt;<i>running mostly older software on the classic platform before this.
</I>
If you have not already downloaded the update to ViaVoice for Mac OS 
X from IBM and installed it do so.

&lt;<A HREF="http://www-3.ibm.com/software/speech/support/us/vvmac3_update.html">http://www-3.ibm.com/software/speech/support/us/vvmac3_update.html</A>&gt;

IBM only supports it up through OS X 10.2.2 officially; but I've been 
running it under 10.2.3 without any problems.  This update does solve 
many problems with running ViaVoice under Jaguar.


&gt;<i>The main issue right now is that I can't get the Setup
</I>&gt;<i>Assistant to analyze my documents. When I click on the add button, I am
</I>&gt;<i>presented with an hierarchical display which I can follow through to the
</I>&gt;<i>text documents that I want to add, but the documents are ghostly and I can't
</I>&gt;<i>highlight them, can't add them. Even documents created by my new VV program
</I>&gt;<i>are not reachable.
</I>
Any documents you want to analyze must be in Plain Text format. 
SpeakPad, TextEdit, and many others use RTF format.  What I did was 
create a folder called Sample Documents then use my word processor to 
save copies of documents in text format to that folder.  Then I just 
told ViaVoice to analyze everything in that folder.

NOTE: SpeakPad documents can only be analyzed during a Save and to do 
so you must have Analyze When Saving Documents checked in your 
SpeakPad Preferences.  Otherwise you must convert them to plain text 
and then analyze them.

&gt;<i>My speakpad freezes up on me at times and won't respond
</I>&gt;<i>to any commands (I know this is a reported problem)
</I>
What I do for this is to use the Save option in the file menu every 
few minute AND check the option to save the dictation session.  You 
can *usually* do this via keyboard and mouse right after a freeze 
too.  That way when SpeakPad freezes not only isn't much lost, but 
When I reload the file after Quitting /relaunching SpeakPad I still 
have all the audio data avail;able should I need to correct 
recognition errors in what I've already dictated.

&gt;<i>I can't get the
</I>&gt;<i>program to register the software with  IBM. It states that it &quot;can't form an
</I>&gt;<i>internet connection&quot; despite the fact that Explorer is working fine, up and
</I>&gt;<i>running.
</I>
This is most likely a problem with the server on IBM's end.  If it 
persists call support and report it (along with any other problems). 
Not being able to register is a legitimate reason for calling support.

&gt;<i>Please tell me this is some silly little mistake on my part.
</I>
It isn't.
