<PRE>I e-mailed technical-support about this problem and was told it is 
due to a corrupted voice model. The recommendation was to throw out 
the voice model. Working from a backup is risky because the 
corruption may have been present when the backup was made. I'd 
already started over several times and it was impossible to 'live 
with' because it happened too early in the training and required 
starting from scratch every time.  In my case all this made ViaVoice 
unusable.

The good news is that after updating to Mac OS X 10.2.2 (and 10.2.3) 
the problem no longer occurs.  I do not know whether it was 
necessary, but I reinstalled ViaVoice and did a fresh enrollment 
after applying the updates. When the ViaVoice update was released I 
trashed my user files and started over again (again).  I had never 
been able to get very far, so there wasn't much to trash, and I'd 
trained so many times that it doesn't take all that long now.
