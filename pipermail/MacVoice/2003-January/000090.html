If the one doesn't work then neither do any or the other methods; at least
that's the case for me.  It is very irritating this problem has gone on so
long and not been addressed.  This has not worked for me since day one (in
vv 3.0, it always worked in the earlier version).

I did manage to fix it once then a few days later my disk died and the back
up I had did not include whatever I'd changed and I cannot get it back to
working.  Uninstall and reinstall do not fix this.

On machines affected by this bug &quot;Analyze My Documents&quot; will produce a list
of words to add but you cannot add them because you cannot record your
pronunciation.  &quot;Manage my Vocabulary&quot; will open and allow you to enter a
new word but here again you cannot record it.  When you try nothing gets
recorded as if the mic is not plugged in (the headset was working normally
in SpeakPad and in the System Preferences).  If you record nothing VV
ignores the new word.
