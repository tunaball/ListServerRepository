<PRE>Everyone:

After many months of work, I am pleased to announce a new project I 
have been working on called &quot;CommandSets.com.&quot; Our final hurdle was to 
meet with software developers, consultants, and Apple people to 
validate our concept. Everyone has given us a &quot;thumbs up&quot; so we want 
you to be among the first to know.

CommandSets.com is designed to bridge the gap between the three speech 
platforms available on the Mac (iListen, PlainTalk, and ViaVoice), and 
the most popular Macintosh applications. We have been working on this 
for some time, and  are launching now with the following CommandSets 
for iListen and ViaVoice (PlainTalk will come a little later):

	BBEdit 6.5		
	iCal		
	iPhoto
	iTunes
	Mail			
	Microsoft Excel
	Microsoft PowerPoint
	Microsoft Word
	Microsoft MSN Messenger

Together, these command sets have over 600 commands (the Word set alone 
has almost 150!). Best of all, the commands are identical for both 
iListen and ViaVoice, so if you have both programs, you don't have to 
learn different commands - or take the time to write them all twice! 
(The commands will also be identical for PlainTalk, when those sets 
become available in a few weeks.)

The web site still needs work, but we wanted to get what we could out 
to you as soon as possible.

We have many more Command Sets in the works, and will let you know on 
the list when they are become available. Below is the press release 
that is going out tonight.

Best Regards,

Chuck Rogers
Chuck Rogers Consulting



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

COMMANDSETS.COM TO INTRODUCE COMMAND SETS FOR PLAINTALK, iLISTEN, and 
VIAVOICE

MacWorld Expo - January 9, 2003 &#8212; Chuck Rogers Consulting is pleased to 
announce CommandSets.com, a web site dedicated to the distribution of 
voice commands for iListen&#8482; from MacSpeech, ViaVoice&#8482; from IBM, and 
Apple's PlainTalk&#8482;. Command Sets with thousands of unique commands will 
be introduced later this month for most of Apple's iApps, the Microsoft 
Office Suite of applications, BBEdit, Acrobat and Acrobat Reader, 
America Online, Quicken, QuickBooks, and FileMaker Pro &#8212; with many more 
to follow.

&quot;The one thing all the major speech applications available for 
Macintosh have in common is their ability to control the computer using 
voice commands,&quot; said Chuck Rogers, principal of Chuck Rogers 
Consulting. &#8220;While dictation accuracy can vary widely between users and 
computers, commands are almost always recognized correctly. We are 
capitalizing on this capability by introducing Command Sets for 
controlling the most popular Macintosh applications, and will keep 
users up to date as developers change their programs.&quot;

Command Sets for iListen are imported directly into the application, 
unlike the MacSpeech's ScriptPaks, which require two separate 
installations before they can be used. ViaVoice's Command Sets are in 
the form of Keyboard Shortcut Dictionaries, or KSDs. Command Sets for 
Apple's PlainTalk will be distributed as a collection of scripts that 
are installed in the Apple Speakable Items folder.

Chuck Rogers Consulting is a group of talented Macintosh fanatics led 
by Chuck Rogers who was formerly the Senior Small Business Evangelist 
for Apple Computer, and the Chief Evangelist for MacSpeech, Inc. More 
information about CommandSets.com can be found at 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.commandsets.com">http://www.commandsets.com</A>&gt;.


iListen is a trademark of MacSpeech, Inc.
ViaVoice is a trademark of IBM, Inc.
PlainTalk is a trademark of Apple Computer, Inc.
