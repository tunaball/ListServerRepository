Thanks David,

But as I stated,

I have worked with the microphone set up many times and it seems to usually set the number at roughly 54. On other times, I have manually dragged the volume slider on the setup down to 10 or 15, much softer, and it still has these problems.

So it seems that it is just doing this no matter what... even if I and the room are silent...

</I>&gt;<i> #2	I&#8217;m not familiar with text macros and obviously have never used them. So I really can&#8217;t respond to this.
</I>
Any one else?


2 - I work with text macros, and a new problem that has arisen is that often, after I say a text macro, the following normal words that come after are not recognized, so they are lost. This is a new occurrence that I don't remember prior to this latest update. This is troublesome. Has anyone else experienced this?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello everybody,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a couple of issues working with Dragon Dictate 2.0.1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1 - no matter what I seem to do with the headset, or the microphone set up, I seem to still get random words popping in quite often on the Dictate notepad, generally words like: the a etc. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In addition, I have made sure that the microphone is in no way close to my mouth where it might be getting any wind noise. Also I work in a very quiet environment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My microphone is a $50 Plantronics USB headset. This has always worked fine in the past, without this issue appearing.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3 - DASH: sometimes I will say the word 'dash' in the middle of a phrase, and dictate will put it between the two words with no spaces. Personally, I will always want spaces on either side of the character. In the vocabulary editor, I tried to create the character set that I wanted: SPACE-SPACE, hoping it would override the other one I said the word 'dash' but it does not seem to be working correctly. Any ideas how to get this working to override the dictate default?
