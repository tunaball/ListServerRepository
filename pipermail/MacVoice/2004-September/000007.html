<PRE>Hello,

This is a &quot;discrete speech recognition&quot; issue. I plan a future test 
of the iListen software to perform the same function. This post 
relates to people who obviously do not have iListen. However, the 
iListen people can feel free to chime in.

I have an application that I want to control via Speakable Items. I 
have an iSight camera pluged into a Dual 1.42GHz G4 Desktop. I want 
to execute an applescript command by voice command.

I can not get Speakable Items to execute the applescript script.

Background information. Some paths are entered in this post in all 
lowercase for my convienience. Some of the steps 1-9 listed below 
were in response to the instructions in the Apple Help system 
relating to speakable items.

1) The iSight is plugged into the computer.
2) Speakable Items is turned on.
3) The system can recognize commands such as &quot;open Sherlock&quot;.
4) A folder that is named the same as the application that needs to 
be controlled, does exist in ~($HOME)/Library/speech/speakable 
items/applications/application speakable items
5) I used UI Browser to creat a script for GUI scripting purposes. I 
compiled the script. When I execute the script in Script Editor , the 
required GUI action is performed (click a menu item). The script file 
is named &quot;open virtual reality file&quot;
6) The script was dragged into the folder listed in #4 above.
7) The application is speakable. I used my voice to make it speakable 
in accordance with the information in Mac Help  relating to speakable 
items.
8) Speakable items will recognize the phrase &quot;open virtual reality 
file&quot; and the text &quot; open virtual reality file&quot;, spelled correctly, 
appears in the top pane of the speech command window.
9) In  the ~($HOME)/Library/speech/speakable items/, a get info on 
file &quot;close this window&quot; gives a kind of &quot;speakable items document&quot; 
and open with &quot;speakableitems&quot; and the icon is a sort of blank 
document icon. In the folder listed in #4 above, a get info on file 
&quot;open virtual reality file&quot; gives a kind of &quot;script&quot; and open with 
&quot;Script Editor (default) 2.0&quot; and the icon is the Applescript icon.

The command &quot;open virtual reality file&quot; does NOT appear in the bottom 
pane of the speech command window with all the other command like 
&quot;open Sherlock&quot;, &quot;close this window&quot;, &quot;what can I say&quot;,.....

Any ideas on how to get the command to appear in the speech command 
window and to get the script to execute when I say &quot;open virtual 
reality file&quot;? How can I change the Kind to &quot;speakable items 
document&quot; and where can I find speakable items so I can tell OSX to 
open it with speakable items?

John F. Richardson
