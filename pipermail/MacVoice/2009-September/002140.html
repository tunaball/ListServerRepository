<PRE>I am not on a machine to test it, but I was thinking 1.5 fixed that issue,
not 1.3.  NOT SURE, trying to rely on memory.  I am thinking a purge cache
might solve it, too, but then you have to be sure you have made your
previous corrections.  I am working on a very different machine now, and I
rarely use Notepad, but I THINK it was originally meant to be used
exclusively with MSD, and no hand-typing.  I can tell you that running 1.5
in Snow Leopard there are no issues with the integrated Note Pad mixing
keyboard and voice, being sure to cache your selection. I'm not sure if that
helps you much, sorry I can't tell you more about 1.3 at the moment. My
older iMac is &quot;under the weather&quot; and not set up for speech at the moment.

Take care!

Valerie

</I>&gt;<i>   first of all -- I would like to state that for me, the Macvoice
</I>&gt;<i> listserver was not working for several months. That's what I kept

</I>&gt;<i> things are working better now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently I am using Dictate version 1.3
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - my biggest issue is that when I attempt to work with the dictate
</I>&gt;<i> notepad, I will dictate some text, and then if I try to do any
</I>&gt;<i> manual typing -- the text will always type backwards at that location.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Example:  if I manually type 'rat' -  it will type 'tar'
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -  also if I place the cursor somewhere -- an attempt to hit return
</I>&gt;<i> -- very often it will turn the text to gobbledygook in that area...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   it always does this

</I>&gt;<i>   hi Chuck -- interesting that you never saw this problem since it
</I>&gt;<i> happens to me every single time...  are you saying that when you used
</I>&gt;<i> version 1.3 -  it did not do this -  or maybe you never tried it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -----
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway -  that is a big drag -- because I am accustomed to working
</I>&gt;<i> fast -- as I did easily in ViaVoice -  and I will dictate most of the
</I>&gt;<i> text but do manual additions and modifications by hand for the sake
</I>&gt;<i> of speed. Trying to navigate around the document by using manual
</I>&gt;<i> dictation was very slow and never interested me at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   so my biggest question is that:  has this been fixed at all in
</I>&gt;<i> version 1.5?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Q:  can you now dictate text  in to dictate notepad -- then manually
</I>&gt;<i> place the cursor anywhere -  make whatever modifications you desire
</I>&gt;<i> -- and then put the cursor -  anywhere and continued dictating?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW:  all this works absolutely fine outside of the Dictate notepad
</I>&gt;<i> -- however the giant drawback is that you can't use any of the good
</I>&gt;<i> functionality that they have inside of Dictate Notepad.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   for example -  for me it is important to be able to look back on
</I>&gt;<i> the text -  highlight a section that does not look right -- and
</I>&gt;<i> playback my real voice -  to see what I said -  and then repaired the
</I>&gt;<i> errors ( may be even by hand or through dictation).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   So ultimately it would be much better if Dictate Notepad could do
</I>&gt;<i> the basics that ViaVoice notepad did years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -  aside from that big drawback -- I am very impressed with the
</I>&gt;<i> basic  speech recognition of this new product...  but before I
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade I would like to know if the notepad typing issue has been
</I>&gt;<i> fixed...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   thanks for your help -- Dave
