<PRE>Regina (and everyone else):

Sorry you had a poor experience with iListen in the past. Did you  
contact our support department and have them work with you?

I can tell you from experience and from direct contact with literally  
hundreds of users over the years that you absolutely can achieve near  
100% accuracy with iListen. How near? A lot depends on how much you  
work with it. We have people who use it for two weeks and are getting  
above 98% accuracy. Our most extreme example is a physician with an  
east Indian accent who was using the US version. It took him 9  
months, but he insists he is getting at least 99% accuracy after he  
continued to work with the software.

Any speech recognition program requires a practiced approach in order  
to get the best results, and ours is no different. The beauty of  
iListen, of course, is that you can dictate into virtually any  
application and you don't have to use Windows (either in Parallels or  
by rebooting) to use it.

Best Regards,

Chuck Rogers

</I>&gt;<i> However, when I researched this I heard that there are bugs, and I

</I>&gt;<i> Since there

</I>&gt;<i> either of these things are really true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, what would I do exactly? Install Parallels, then Windows XP,  
</I>&gt;<i> then DNS?
</I>&gt;<i> I also heard that Windows XP runs better with Boot Camp for some  
</I>&gt;<i> reason -- I
</I>&gt;<i> think having to do with how much resources it uses up for your  
</I>&gt;<i> computer to
</I>&gt;<i> run both systems at the same time.  What is the difference between  
</I>&gt;<i> Parallels
</I>&gt;<i> and Bootcamp?  Are there any voice recognition products in the  
</I>&gt;<i> works for the
</I>&gt;<i> Mac that are commensurate with DNS?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One more thing, while I'm at it.... I have been a writer for all of  
</I>&gt;<i> my life
</I>&gt;<i> and find that it's a very specific process that starts with creating
</I>&gt;<i> words/sounds in the quiet of my mind and then these get recorded  
</I>&gt;<i> through the
</I>&gt;<i> activity of my hands either by writing or typing.  Writing is a very
</I>&gt;<i> specific neurological process and I have not been able to access this
</I>&gt;<i> process orally.  Speaking is a completely different neurological  
</I>&gt;<i> process and
</I>&gt;<i> puts me in a completely different place where I can't &quot;compose.&quot; In  
</I>&gt;<i> fact
</I>&gt;<i> speaking seems to interrupt my writing process just like throwing  
</I>&gt;<i> stones
</I>&gt;<i> into a pond disturbs the water.  I'm sure others have gone through  
</I>&gt;<i> this to
</I>&gt;<i> rewire their writing mechanism for voice recognition and I would be  
</I>&gt;<i> very
</I>&gt;<i> interested if someone could write out the steps they went through  
</I>&gt;<i> or point
</I>&gt;<i> me to a place where someone has outlined these steps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks everyone for all of your help!
</I>&gt;<i>
