<PRE>no problems with DNS8 on a MacBook 2.0ghz core2duo, 1gb ram.  I have  
bootcamp going with WinXP SP2, and an andrea7100 headset.  watch the  
headsets, tho' cause the MacBook internal power supply causes buzzing  
with some headsets when plugged in to the charger... notably an  
otherwise really nice plantronics DSP 400 i bought and can't get to  
work :-(

good luck, but its worth the extra time + money.

</I>&gt;<i> I have CTS in both hands and need to incorporate voice recognition

</I>&gt;<i> experiment with

</I>&gt;<i> several times, and never reached anything even remotely approaching an
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable accuracy rate.  Last summer, after the CTS diagnosis, I  
</I>&gt;<i> tried

</I>&gt;<i> newer
</I>&gt;<i> version, but most of the reviews on Amazon described exactly the  
</I>&gt;<i> same kind
</I>&gt;<i> of frustrating situation I had experienced with the older version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the same time was given DNS on my PC at work and almost fell  
</I>&gt;<i> over when I
</I>&gt;<i> found how easy it was to train and use with a very high accuracy  
</I>&gt;<i> rate almost
</I>&gt;<i> immediately.  I am a fundraiser and have to do a lot of different  
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> writing using fairly technical language. Since I have a MacBook  
</I>&gt;<i> with Intel I
</I>&gt;<i> started looking into setting my home computer up so I could use  
</I>&gt;<i> DNS.  (I'm a
</I>&gt;<i> Mac person through and through!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, when I researched this I heard that there are bugs, and I  
</I>&gt;<i> am just
</I>&gt;<i> not computer savvy.  Plus I heard that running Windows on my Mac  
</I>&gt;<i> would make
</I>&gt;<i> me vulnerable to all the virulent computer viruses out there.   
</I>&gt;<i> Since there
</I>&gt;<i> are so many experienced people on this list, I would like to find  
</I>&gt;<i> out if
</I>&gt;<i> either of these things are really true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, what would I do exactly? Install Parallels, then Windows XP,  
</I>&gt;<i> then DNS?
</I>&gt;<i> I also heard that Windows XP runs better with Boot Camp for some  
</I>&gt;<i> reason -- I
</I>&gt;<i> think having to do with how much resources it uses up for your  
</I>&gt;<i> computer to
</I>&gt;<i> run both systems at the same time.  What is the difference between  
</I>&gt;<i> Parallels
</I>&gt;<i> and Bootcamp?  Are there any voice recognition products in the  
</I>&gt;<i> works for the
</I>&gt;<i> Mac that are commensurate with DNS?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One more thing, while I'm at it.... I have been a writer for all of  
</I>&gt;<i> my life
</I>&gt;<i> and find that it's a very specific process that starts with creating
</I>&gt;<i> words/sounds in the quiet of my mind and then these get recorded  
</I>&gt;<i> through the
</I>&gt;<i> activity of my hands either by writing or typing.  Writing is a very
</I>&gt;<i> specific neurological process and I have not been able to access this
</I>&gt;<i> process orally.  Speaking is a completely different neurological  
</I>&gt;<i> process and
</I>&gt;<i> puts me in a completely different place where I can't &quot;compose.&quot; In  
</I>&gt;<i> fact
</I>&gt;<i> speaking seems to interrupt my writing process just like throwing  
</I>&gt;<i> stones
</I>&gt;<i> into a pond disturbs the water.  I'm sure others have gone through  
</I>&gt;<i> this to
</I>&gt;<i> rewire their writing mechanism for voice recognition and I would be  
</I>&gt;<i> very
</I>&gt;<i> interested if someone could write out the steps they went through  
</I>&gt;<i> or point
</I>&gt;<i> me to a place where someone has outlined these steps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks everyone for all of your help!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Warm regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
