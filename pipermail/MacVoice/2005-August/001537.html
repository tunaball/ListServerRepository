<PRE>Steph (and everyone else):

Developing speech recognition software is very time consuming and  
complex. A LanguagePak is quite literally a different version of the  
Philips speech engine (which we license) running under an interface  
that is in a different language. For instance, we have quite a few  
customers who install the German LanguagePak in their US or UK  
version of iListen, which means the menus and buttons are all still  
in English, but they can dictate in German.

Unfortunately, the French version of the speech engine cannot be  
ported over to the Mac. We have tried - and we have also gone back to  
Philips and attempted to work with them to resolve the technical  
issues that prevent the current version from working on Mac OS X.  
Unfortunately, these technical issues are of such a nature that there  
is no fix available - the only solution would be to rewrite the  
engine from scratch - something Philips is not willing to do.

So it is not possible for a third party to create a LanguagePak, nor  
will we be able to provide a French version of iListen in the  
foreseeable future.

Believe me - we have gone over this with a fine tooth comb, and wish  
we could give better news. We understand there is a need for French  
dictation software on the Mac, but since we are the only ones  
developing speech software for the Mac and Philips does not feel the  
sales opportunity on the Mac warrants their time and effort, no  
solution will be forthcoming.

Chuck Rogers, Chief Evangelist
