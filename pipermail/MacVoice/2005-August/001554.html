<PRE>To all:

Sorry about the previous post. That was meant to be internal (mistakes 
do happen to the best of us sometimes).

Having said that I can tell you as one who has written commands in both 
NaturallySpeaking and iListen that it is easier to do in iListen.

The over 120 commands I mentioned are special commands for navigating 
through and selecting preexisting text *that was not dictated*

Before you ask, these commands have deliberately not been made 
available because they can at times behave in very unpredictable ways. 
Nobody likes to have their work unnecessarily altered by software doing 
something unpredictable. Especially, if it means you have to reproduce 
the work (which can sometimes happened with these commands and I have 
yet to figure out why).

As a stated at the top of this e-mail message the previous post to this 
list was a mistake and meant for a coworker only. As the Technical 
Support Manager and a disabled user I often write custom commands for 
myself. Some turn out to be more trouble than they are worth and get 
deleted others are highly specific to my job and will never make it 
into a shipping release, still others do make it into shipping releases 
if no problems turn up during beta testing.

Normally, I make it a policy *not* to post to this list (leaving that 
for our Chief Evangelist). Why? because I often experiment and 
encounter difficulties. Detailing those difficulties would 
unnecessarily paint a bad picture of the software.
