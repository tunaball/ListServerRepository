<PRE>Chuck,

In light of your comments, I note that the Founders still have not received
the promised details about a special upgrade offer. I assume that is because
the demand for Dictate has outpaced the current staff resources. However, I
make two points:

1) A Founders' offer should have been ready to announce and roll out to
Founders before the launch, and simply hit &quot;send&quot; when the time was right.

2) if Founders don't have details on that soon, how do we know we are not
better off taking advantage of the cross-grade offer before it expires? [I
would HOPE the Founders will get at least as good, or better a deal than
cross-graders].
 
Patiently,
Chris G
