<PRE>Mark (and everyone else):

Please be patient. MacSpeech is a very small company and even though  
we anticipated great demand for MacSpeech Dictate, we could not have  
anticipated such a robust response to our announcement. It is taking  
several days - and in some cases weeks - to respond to some people.

All requests, whether to support or sales, go into our support system  
and generate a support ticket. Our support people prioritize tickets  
starting with those people who are having problems with iListen, as  
that is our current product. Questions about MacSpeech Dictate are  
handled in the order they are received after all iListen questions  
have been answered.

Anyone who did not get the opportunity to take advantage of the cross  
grade discount offer will be given the opportunity to do so.



Best Regards,

Chuck Rogers, Chief Evangelist
MacSpeech, Inc.
