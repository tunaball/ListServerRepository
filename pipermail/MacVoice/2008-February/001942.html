<PRE>Chris:

Let me see if I can make this crystal clear for you and any other  
Founder that is on this list:

MacSpeech Dictate has not shipped yet. Founders ALWAYS get the very  
best price on all major releases. No exceptions. That's what we  
promised you, and that is what you will get. We will send a note out  
to Founders before we ship to the public. Until we are sure exactly  
when that will be, we are entirely focused on making the first release  
as good as it can possibly be.

To summarize, I can assure you with 100% confidence that Founders will  
a). be informed before it ships and b). get a deal as good or better  
than the Macworld deal.

Please be patient. Everyone at MacSpeech is working on all cylinders  
right now. All Founders will get a communication when we have some  
details to share with you. Right now, we have no details.



Best Regards,

Chuck Rogers, Chief Evangelist
MacSpeech, Inc.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) if Founders don't have details on that soon, how do we know we

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please be patient. MacSpeech is a very small company and even though

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All requests, whether to support or sales, go into our support system

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handled in the order they are received after all iListen questions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have been answered.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyone who did not get the opportunity to take advantage of the cross
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grade discount offer will be given the opportunity to do so.
