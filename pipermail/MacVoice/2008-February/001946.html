<PRE>&gt;<i> All of us in the Mac Community are so happy for your success.
</I>
I'll echo that.  I'm very happy to see this happen.  I'm a Founder,  
was lucky enough to be able to buy a (very) tiny piece of the company  
years ago, and have been a supporter of MacSpeech since the 1990's.   
It's always been an exciting company with great people.

Oddly enough, though, I've never been able to use the product!  First  
my computer was underpowered.  When I upgraded to a Quicksilver  
dual-800 MHz G4 after getting out of school, it turned out that that  
model that had a firmware bug that Apple never fixed, and since I was  
pretty much the lone Mac user hereabouts (then, not a problem now with  
Apple's recovery) I never was able to get the training to work properly.

So, needless to say, after more than 10 years, now with a 2.4 GHz C2D  
MacBook Pro, I'm excited to be on the verge of getting what I have no  
doubt will be the best Mac speech recognition product ever.

After a decade, a couple of months more is nothing. :-)

Congratulations and I'm looking forward to getting the software!

Kevin
