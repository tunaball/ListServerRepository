<PRE>The way I see it, you can't help us if we don't help you. Things
function better in a society and an economy when you have co-operation
as well as competition (that's the socialist in me talking &lt;g&gt;). I never
forsaw Dictate or anything like it, even when Apple switched to Intel.
But I would have kept upgrading iListen at intervals just the same. Not
all of the debt I've managed to get my husband and myself into is
medically related; some of it comes from putting his money where my
mouth is ;-)

At 3:59 PM, 2/2/08 or thereabouts, Chuck Rogers spake thus:

&gt;<i>And all of us at MacSpeech are extraordinarily grateful and humbled by  
</I>&gt;<i>the support you and so many others have shown us through the years.  
</I>&gt;<i>Were it not for you, MacSpeech Dictate would not have been possible.
</I>

Best,
