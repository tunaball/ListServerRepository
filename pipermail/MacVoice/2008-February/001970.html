<PRE>Everyone:

I'd like to update everyone on the status of MacSpeech Dictate,  
including those trying to purchase from our international distributors.

As most of you know, we made a pretty big splash at Macworld Expo.  
While we knew the response would be incredible, we had no idea how  
overwhelming it would be. In order to meet the demand we have  
increased our sales and support staff (and trained them quickly), and  
we also made a decision to roll out the product in stages, rather than  
all at once, so we could keep up with not only the initial sales, but  
also the post-sales support.

On February 15th we started shipping to our Founders - those who took  
a chance on us and bought a T-shirt from us over a year before we  
started shipping iListen. We promised them first access to any new  
products as part of our thank you for having faith in us, so that's  
why they get it first.

 From there we have orders we took at Macworld to send out, as well as  
all those who have already purchased crossgrades directly from us.  
This means that even as product starts to arrive at our distributors,  
it will be constrained at first. So I would like to ask all of you to  
please have patience and cut your local distributors and resellers  
some slack when they say they don't know when they will be getting  
copies of MacSpeech Dictate in stock - they really don't!

If you need more information, take a look at the following press  
release, or feel free to contact me directly.
