<PRE>
At 12:20 PM, 2/2/08 or thereabouts, Chuck Rogers spake thus:

&gt;<i>Erica (and everyone else):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Don't feel bad about not being a Founder. When we made the offer, we  
</I>&gt;<i>were very specific that we may never produce a product (in which case  
</I>&gt;<i>all everyone would have received was a lovely T-shirt). MacSpeech has  
</I>&gt;<i>had a long history of &quot;barely making it,&quot; and were it not for the  
</I>&gt;<i>kindness of others and the perseverance of its employees and customers  
</I>&gt;<i>through some very dark times, it would have gone away just like so  
</I>&gt;<i>many other software companies have in the last 10 years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It is easy to say &quot;shoulda, woulda, coulda&quot; with the benefit of  
</I>&gt;<i>hindsight. Placing a bet up front requires faith and a willingness to  
</I>&gt;<i>take a risk. For instance - I really wish I would have bought Apple  
</I>&gt;<i>stock when it was at $11 per share.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>While Founders may get a slight advantage, I'd like to think that -  
</I>&gt;<i>current problems notwithstanding - we provide exemplary treatment for  
</I>&gt;<i>all our customers. We certainly try to do our best.
</I>
I know myself well enough not to consider using hindsight as an aide de
memoire. I'm not mourning a loss of some 'advantage' (which I didn't
know there was anyway). I don't get back anything from the money I pay
regularly to Greenpeace, The Wilderness Society, World Vision etc.
either; I pay the money because I believe in what the recipients are
doing with it, and it would have been the same with you if I'd known
about the Founder scheme. I wouldn't have been certain of getting a
usable product, and as it happened I've paid a fair bit of money anyway
and not got a usable product. But I kept paying the money just the same,
because I wanted to support MacSpeech and because I kept hoping that the
next version would work for me ... but I was never sure. And now we have
Dictate, which I'm very optimistic about.


Best,

Erica M.N. Mackenzie
