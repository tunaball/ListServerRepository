I am a Founder and bought the Macworld Expo crossgrade because no  
announcement had been made about Founder pricing and I didn't want to  
lose out on what might have been the only price break offered.  I  
hope that if there's a difference between the two that the difference  
will be refunded to me.

I look forward to getting the product as my disability has worsened  
over the last year and the pain is such that it's very hard for me to  
continue typing notes like this as I have.
