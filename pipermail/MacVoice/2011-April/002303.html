<PRE>You are spot on with why Nuance has poor customer support. From a purely business perspective, the only reason to offer any sort of customer support at all is to sell more product. If your customers are not satisfied, they will buy from your competitor - and good customer support is a key strategy to having satisfied customers. When you have no competition, your customers can't buy anywhere else, so it doesn't matter if they aren't satisfied (again, from a purely business or economic perspective).

This was proven a few years ago with digital dictation recorders. Olympus was pretty much the only game in town for many years. In fact, if you contacted them for support, they would say &quot;we do not offer customer support, please contact the dealer from which you bought your recorder.&quot; You think Office Depot or Target are going to know how to help you with this device? Fat chance. Then along came Fujitsu who started to put a serious dent into Olympus' sales. They did this in two ways: by offering an excellent product at a reasonable price, and by offering excellent support. Olympus now offers technical support for their devices.

But I don't think you have to worry about Dragon dropping the Macintosh product line any time soon. For one thing, it would have been easy enough for them to just continue licensing the engine to MacSpeech. The fact that they bought the company means they have a fair amount of confidence that selling Mac products will be profitable for them.
