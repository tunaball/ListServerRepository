Hello all,

I have been using Dragon dictate for the Mac for six months or so. Ever since it came out as Dragon Dictate for the mac.
 I was active in the group for a while but things seem to slow down. And then there were people who complained about the program. I on the other hand had very few problems but I did read the guidelines or suggestions. I did the training that the have you go through.

I got tired of trying to convince people that they should work with the program. Also there is a &#8220;user group&#8221; on Amazon for users of DragonDictate. Once again you have the people that really enjoy it and like it. And then you have the people who whine and cry that it won&#8217;t work. In the instructions it does tell you that if you use the notepad that comes with Dragon Dictate you will have less problems. But to me using that  notepad and then having to cut-and-paste was a pain. Therefore I decided to try it out in an e-mail first. Then I tried it in word. Then I went on and use it in &#8220;pages&#8221; to create a newsletter. I have not had major problems in any of the applications that I&#8217;ve used it with.

So I guess you could mark me down as a happy user.

By the way, this is all being typed with Dragon dictate. So I guess it works.	;&#8211;)

David
