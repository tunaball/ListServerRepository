<PRE>MacSpeech Releases Australian/UK iListen 1.6.5

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Salem, NH, 2004-11-01:  Macintosh Speech Recognition authority 
MacSpeech, Inc. released an update to the UK English version its 
popular iListen speech recognition program today. iListen 1.6.5 
includes numerous enhancements and bug fixes and is a free update to 
anyone using version 1.5 and later.

MacSpeech has increased the total number of commands that can be in any 
one command set from 256 to 2,048, and made it possible for individual 
commands to be disabled. The command set version number is now 
displayed in the command list so users can verify that they have the 
most recent version of a particular command set or ScriptPak. The Mac 
OS X Voice Launcher has been completely revamped to include all of the 
programs Apple ships with every Macintosh as well as many of the most 
popular Macintosh programs.

Several other enhancements were made to correction mode, and new 
dictation commands have also been added. A complete list of changes is 
included in the documentation that accompanies the update.

&quot;It's pleasing to see development for iListen is keeping pace with the 
Mac OS X platform.&quot;, said Carl Gavet of MacSense Australia. &quot;Better 
still, there aren't any Mac software products I'm aware of, that are 
the top of their field and offer the benefits of this release for free 
through an upgrade program. It's a great story to tell. Well done 
MacSpeech!&quot;

The iListen 1.6.5 updater is available to all current iListen 
Australian/New Zealand subscribers through the link, 
<A HREF="http://www.macsense.com.au/support/ilisten_update.htm">http://www.macsense.com.au/support/ilisten_update.htm</A>

MacSense Australia distributes software and hardware for Macintosh. 
Based in Chippendale, New South Wales, MacSense distributes and 
supports iListen in Australia and New Zealand. More information about 
MacSense can be found at the company's web site, 
(<A HREF="http://www.macsense.com.au">http://www.macsense.com.au</A>).

ScriptPaks work with MacSpeech's flagship product, iListen, whose 
TalkAnywhere(TM) technology allows users to dictate anywhere they would 
normally type. ScriptPaks enhance iListen's Command &amp; Control 
capabilities by teaching it about the individual keyboard and menu 
commands in a specific program. ScriptPaks only affect iListen's 
ability to control an application and are not required for dictation.

MacSpeech offers several iListen packages, including a software only 
solution for $99, and a software and headset with microphone for $149.

MacSpeech is a Mac-only company dedicated to producing the finest 
speech products for Macintosh.
