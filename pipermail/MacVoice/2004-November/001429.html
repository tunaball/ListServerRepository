<PRE>Obviously I had several recognition errors I missed; hopefully I made sense
anyway.  ;-)

Should be give it another try
Should have been Chuck, not chat

Sorry!

&gt;<i> Dear Bert;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am a person who tried iListen about a year ago and was totally frustrated,
</I>&gt;<i> but when my main computer again became a Macintosh, I decided to &quot;give
</I>&gt;<i> another trite&quot;. After listening to extensive feedback on the list and
</I>&gt;<i> rethinking my strategy toward using the product, I can away with several
</I>&gt;<i> things that I do not feel are emphasized nearly strongly enough, one of
</I>&gt;<i> which will be enormously beneficial to someone like yourself dictating
</I>&gt;<i> reports that probably share common vocabulary for your usage. Namely, the
</I>&gt;<i> importance of having the software learn your writing style through reviewing
</I>&gt;<i> your documents will be critical to adding common words for you that may not
</I>&gt;<i> be common to its vocabulary. Second, taking the time to do all of the
</I>&gt;<i> training passages, one at the time, will improve your dictation accuracy as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My personal experience with all voice recognition products (and I have used
</I>&gt;<i> every product on both the Macintosh and the PC at many different levels with
</I>&gt;<i> many different operating systems) is the profound difference that a
</I>&gt;<i> particular combination of sound card and microphone can make. My best
</I>&gt;<i> results to date are not with a headset, but rather a Sennheiser hand-held
</I>&gt;<i> microphone mounted with a boom. It worked well with dragon naturally
</I>&gt;<i> speaking professional and works exceptionally well with iListen as well. I
</I>&gt;<i> use it with an Andrea USB pod and have been very pleased with my investment.
</I>&gt;<i> Another issue that cannot be downplayed is the value of having sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> RAM. Although my machines are probably overkill for this purpose, I find it
</I>&gt;<i> is one of the most beneficial improvements dollar for dollar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The product may still not the were you need for it to be, but as &quot;chat&quot; said,
</I>&gt;<i> if we ever want to see speech recognition improved and continue to be
</I>&gt;<i> developed, it is important for them to have as many users as possible give
</I>&gt;<i> feedback to improve the product. I do believe they are trying to meet &quot;than&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> need and expand within the ability of their company. It must be an
</I>&gt;<i> exceptionally difficult task, given the advances of the operating systems
</I>&gt;<i> software over the past few years, especially in such rapid succession. The
</I>&gt;<i> product continues to improve and will hopefully gain a wider acceptance as
</I>&gt;<i> improvements continue to be made.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Taking into account the things I have mentioned, I have found better
</I>&gt;<i> recognition now with iListen than previously with via voice. Hopefully you
</I>&gt;<i> will find the same. As with so many things in life, it's often a matter of
</I>&gt;<i> what you put into it that will determine the quality of your outcome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck, and don't forget to keep us posted on how you are doing and seek
</I>&gt;<i> feedback where we can be helpful...
