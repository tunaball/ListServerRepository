iListen is fast at dictating and relatively accurate.  However, even if 
you're lucky and manage to get a 95% accuracy rate, most of your 
sentences will still contain one or two errors and require correction, 
and it is this that makes speech recognition much slower than touch 
typing.  If you're blind I imagine the correction process is much slower 
than for a sighted person (because you need screen reader software to 
read your sentence back to you).  You really need to talk to other blind 
users to confirm this, but I imagine you would be far better learning to 
touch type.

I don't know how good screen reader software is on the Mac, but it would 
be my guess that the Mac is not the best platform for blind users.  A 
GUI is by definition graphical, i.e. visual.  I would suggest you try an 
entirely textual based system such as Linux.  There is quite a lot of 
free software available for Linux aimed specifically at blind users:

Linux can be used with a Braille display

On the other hand, Apple are planning to integrate a screen reader into 
Tiger if you can wait for that:
