<PRE> I guess it is time for me step in.  I do not know enough about the
software, other than as an intermittent user.  For me, it is doing
everything just fine.

 I have been using ViaVoice off and on for two years on this same machine.
I have not noticed any change in ability through the various OS X upgrades
including today's 10.3.1.  It works consistently and if I'm reading text, it
provides a very accurate input.  It is only when I am thinking and dictating
at the same time that many errors end up in the text input.

I am able to dictate directly into other applications, but my preference is
to use SpeakPad.  Because it allows me to make corrections and have more
control over what I&#185;m doing.  However, the accuracy when dictating into
applications appears to be about the same and highly accurate.  I make very
few corrections.  Certainly it is much faster than when I am typing.

There is no delay (about 1 second) from the time I finish speaking until the
text appears on the screen.  Even when I am reading quite fast.

I wonder how many users don&#185;t participate on this board because  they don&#185;t
need to.  The silent majority? Then, we get mostly negatives from those
having trouble. 

I don&#185;t know why mine works and others don&#185;t. I did come here over a year
ago and found out why mine wouldn&#185;t work then (the inability of VV to
coexist on a machine with a large number of internet bookmarks).  The simple
fixes that were needed in the past may still be needed, but haven&#185;t been
discussed in months or perhaps a year. I don&#185;t remember the details but
assume they  are archived somewhere.

Good luck to all!  It can work just fine!
