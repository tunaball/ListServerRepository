<PRE>Sounds like we are all basically screwed when it comes to support for
ViaVoice on Mac OS X ( 10.2.8+ ).  Has anyone spoken with ScanSoft about
ViaVoice for Mac OS X?  If so, will they be making bug fixes to ViaVoice
to support Mac OS X ( Panther ) and newer?  I basically sounds like we
are down to 1 continuous speech recognition product for Macintosh, and
it is iListen from MacSpeech.  If voice recognition enables you, or your
a Macintosh enthusiasts that enjoys seeing excellent software available
on the Macintosh, you should throw your full support behind MacSpeech.
I know I have.

Thanks...

Todd

I can't speak to your other questions, but for me, VV does not play well
with Panther.

1.  I can't start VoiceCenter directly (I get a &quot;fatal error&quot; in VC). I
CAN
start from SpeakPad, which launches VC.

2.  SpeakPad works, but only while it has focus.  As soon as it loses
focus,
VV seems to forget about its connection to audio.  When I go back to SP,
the
mic isn't recognized.

3.  #2 means that I can't correct.  Once I open the correction window
and
put my cursor there, going back to SP means losing the mic.

Thus, for me, Panther and VV are incompatible.

Others may have different experiences.
