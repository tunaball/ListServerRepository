<PRE>No, no problems or weird behavior since upgraded to Panther from Jaguar 
last month.  If our recall correctly the very first time I tried to 
launch VoiceCenter after operating it wouldn't launch, but I restarted 
and since then it has been trouble-free ( at least as far as voice 
software is concerned).  I never use speakpad and probably never 
will--it's a pretty stupid idea To have their own text editor.

  two things the you might want to think about: First, Speakable Items 
changes my microphone gain to a lower setting than ViaVoice requires.  
Except for the gain settings, they seem to be able to work together 
just fine.  second, I have noticed some strange audio issues with 
panther.  I have a U.S.B. iSub and and external pair of computer 
speakers attached to my headphone jack.  Often the iSub is inactive 
after the computer wakes up, and sometimes the Volume settings change 
without explanation, but for almost always resolved by manually 
changing the volume back.

I guess there is a third thing as well: all this works just fine on my 
old G3 400 PowerBook running Panther.  Also, both systems were updated 
from 10.2.8 ( second update), rather than installed fresh.  Maybe this 
is the distinction--IBM's ViaVoice works fine when installed in Jaguar 
and updated to Panther, but maybe not when installed in panther.  Can 
anybody prove this wrong?  time for some actual data to support this 
hypothesis.

Let's all try and figure this one out,
Damien Fox
