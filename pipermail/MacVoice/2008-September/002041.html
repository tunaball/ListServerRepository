At least in the past, I understand that there was a disagreement over  
how a company should be dealing with their customers.

Chuck, with his high ethical standards and personal reputation,  
brought a substantial amount of credibility to MacSpeech.   
Conversely, his firing smacks of just the opposite.

</I>
I wish they would also.  It has been about six or seven months since  
MacSpeech had a problem with a bad batch of CD's that caused  
installation problems.  You would think that that would have been  
long enough for them to get things worked out so that no one would  
still be getting bad CD's. Yet I still hear from folks who have  
recently purchased MacSpeech Dictate and have found that it won't  
install and who haven't received immediate relief from MacSpeech.

I understand that the company is small, and that programming takes  
time.  But there is no excuse in my mind for lousy customer service.   
 From the very beginning there should have been a page on MacSpeech's  
Web site that said something to the effect of: &quot;MacSpeech Dictate  
won't install?  Put in your disk's serial number, and your name and  
address.  A new disk will be sent to you immediately.&quot;

I think that customers are willing to be very patient and  
understanding if they feel that they are being treated well/fairly.   
If they don't feel that they are being treated well/fairly, I think  
that its natural for them to be dissatisfied, and skeptical about  
everything that a company does.  I believe that is what we have seen  
here.
