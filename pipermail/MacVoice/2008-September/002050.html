<PRE>Arnie:

I would like to say this to you in as clear and succinct a manner  
possible: The reason a company might not respond to a client is  
because they are entirely focused on development and bringing you the  
features you are yearning for. Please make no mistake - I am not  
making any excuses for them, and I happen to agree that they should be  
more communicative (that was what I did with the company before I was  
laid off). But that doesn't mean they aren't doing anything.

MacSpeech has been around for over 10 years. They aren't trying to get  
away with anything. They are simply focused on getting you those  
features that you want. Everyone on this list understands you are  
frustrated and wish they would communicate better. Heck, I think most  
people would agree with you that they could communicate better. But  
don't for a minute interpret their lack of communication as a lack of  
interest in making absolutely the best speech recognition program on  
the Macintosh - or any other platform, for that matter.

So ignoring you might be inconsiderate, and even rude - but it doesn't  
mean they are doing nothing and just taking money from you and other  
unsuspecting souls. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth.  
But complaining here isn't going to get you anywhere. Keep sending  
your emails to the company. I'll bet they read every one, even if they  
don't respond. But there is no one here on this list that can do  
anything to change the policy they have chosen to adopt in regards to  
how they communicate (or don't communicate) with their customers.
