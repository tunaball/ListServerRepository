<PRE>G'day Dictate people and friends,

For those who don't know, my name's Ricky. I live in Melbourne,  
Australia and I run ATMac - it's at <A HREF="http://atmac.org/">http://atmac.org/</A> and it's a blog  
about everything to do with assistive tech, disability, and Macs. All  
the good stuff together!

Anyway, I'm having a rough time health wise just now and I'd like to  
invite you all to write something for ATMac. It gets posted as a  
&quot;guest post&quot; with your name and a link to your email or website if you  
like - here's an example of a post David Niemeijer wrote with his name  
and link at the top:
&lt;<A HREF="http://atmac.org/2008/06/22/whats-missing-on-the-mac/">http://atmac.org/2008/06/22/whats-missing-on-the-mac/</A>&gt;
You can see it's got his name and a link.

Guest posts can be really short or quite long - it's up to you. And as  
long as the topic's about disability and Macs (computers or iPods or  
iPhone etc.) in some way then I'd like to have it. It doesn't have to  
be related to MacSpeech in any way - as long as it's disability and  
Macs then it's cool. Even if your post is critical about something, as  
long as its reasonable and the facts are right then I'll be happy to  
post it - critical posts sometimes get the most responses. It's my  
call about whether something gets posted or not, so check first!

Here are some suggestions for post ideas:
- Have you customised your assistive tech in some way so it works  
better for you? Here's a post like that: &lt;<A HREF="http://atmac.org/2008/04/25/adapt-keystrokes-keyboards-with-layout-kitchen/">http://atmac.org/2008/04/25/adapt-keystrokes-keyboards-with-layout-kitchen/</A> 
 &gt;

- Have you figured out how to accomplish something more easily with  
adaptive software? Here's a post like that from Paul Natch: &lt;<A HREF="http://atmac.org/2008/07/21/hands-free-phone-calls-with-skype-and-macspeech-dictate/">http://atmac.org/2008/07/21/hands-free-phone-calls-with-skype-and-macspeech-dictate/</A> 
 &gt;
This post has been read by more people than any other ATMac post -  
congratulations to Paul!

- Have you found a new piece of software that could be helpful for  
people with disabilities? Here's a post like that: &lt;<A HREF="http://atmac.org/2008/08/25/mindnode-easy-to-use-mindmapping-tool/">http://atmac.org/2008/08/25/mindnode-easy-to-use-mindmapping-tool/</A> 
 &gt; These are the most common posts on ATMac I think, so keep your eyes  
out for software that might be useful.

If you want to read more, just check out the archives here &lt;<A HREF="http://atmac.org/archives/">http://atmac.org/archives/</A> 
 &gt; or ask me! Oh, and if you have an idea for an article it's best to  
email me just to let me know - otherwise I might end up with 3 people  
writing about the same thing!

Warmest Regards,
Ricky
