<PRE>Hi Arnie,

I believe Chuck has already addressed many of the issues you've raised here. Clearly you're very upset about many things pertaining to MacSpeech&#160;- from the product to the (perhaps) non existent customer relations department.&#160;
As Chuck and I have already said - no MacSpeech&#160;&quot;officials&quot; are on this list. Going after Bob (because he had identified himself as a &quot;Founder&quot;) or after Gavin (because he seemed like a &quot;spokesperson&quot;) is, to say the least, unfair to all those folks who are here simply as listmembers, many of whom are disabled and hope to use MacSpeech&#160;Dictate instead of typing etc. If anyone else is as upset as you seem to be - perhaps they could discuss this with you off-list, and Chuck has kindly offered to address issues with you (as a private person, NOT a MacSpeech&#160;official), again - off-list. Then again - you can always write the company itself (but not through this list, please)

I wish you the BEST of Health, Arnie.
Please make good use of Chuck's offer, and let peace reign again on this list.

Best,

Henry




&gt;<i> Initially, just a simple answer to some of the questions would have sufficed. &#160;Now, however we are way beyond that. Now it has become a personal matter. &#160;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;rgb

(245, 248, 240); font-size: 14px; &quot;&gt;&gt; The manner in which some of these issues have not been addressed has really offended me. &#160;
