<PRE>I would add that we need to be willing to pay for the products.  While it
would be nice to have lifetime free updates for the cost of the initial
purchase, it isn't realistic.

It was disappointing that when IBM released VV for OS X (truly a major
upgrade in terms of performance vs. the &quot;Enhanced Edition&quot;), we screamed
bloody murder until they agreed to give it to us for free (which they did).
I wondered at the time whether we weren't shooting ourselves in the foot....

I bought iListen 1.5, and got 1.51 and now 1.6 for free.  Wonderful!  Thank
you.  At some point the functionality of iListen will be enough beyond the
version I paid for that I should be willing to pay again.  A discount for a
loyal user, perhaps.  Free, neither necessary nor desirable.

</I>&gt;<i> Well, maybe it is time to &quot;toot my own horn&quot; (and vent a little).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [warning: Rant on]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This puts a spotlight on why speech recognition on the Macintosh is
</I>&gt;<i> in the state it is in. &quot;Big business&quot; makes its decisions based on
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;big numbers&quot; that they haven't found in the Macintosh market. Since
</I>&gt;<i> 1993, when I got interested in speech recognition at Articulate
</I>&gt;<i> Systems, this has been a passion for me. I have tried to create a
</I>&gt;<i> great product that was also worthwhile for investors to invest in (no
</I>&gt;<i> pay back, no money!). I learned what needed to be done, planned a
</I>&gt;<i> series of products, and have been struggling against the &quot;Powers that
</I>&gt;<i> be&quot; to get it done ever since. Name a company and they have probably
</I>&gt;<i> done as much to put us out of business as they have to help
</I>&gt;<i> (fortunately there were some non-obvious exceptions that made a
</I>&gt;<i> difference). Net result - iListen is still not what it should be and
</I>&gt;<i> not what it could have been, ViaVoice is what it is and Dragon
</I>&gt;<i> Naturally Speaking was announced but never showed up on the Macintosh
</I>&gt;<i> (but they certainly caused me heartburn and investment troubles for
</I>&gt;<i> that time period). Despite all this, we have made progress and we
</I>&gt;<i> have a product that people want to buy. There is still more to be
</I>&gt;<i> done and given the opportunity, we will do it. To have that
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity, MacSpeech has to sell product. So when the next &quot;big
</I>&gt;<i> company&quot; shows up in the Macintosh speech recognition market, either
</I>&gt;<i> be prepared to generate &quot;BIG numbers&quot; for them so they stay or ignore
</I>&gt;<i> them and keep MacSpeech afloat and growing so you continue to have
</I>&gt;<i> future enhancements to speech recognition on the Macintosh. Someday
</I>&gt;<i> we need to be able to pay back the investors that got us this far as
</I>&gt;<i> well as obtain new investment to continue to enhance our products.
</I>&gt;<i> Passion for the Mac, the product and the technology is why I do this,
</I>&gt;<i> cash makes it possible. It is really up to you, the Macintosh
</I>&gt;<i> community, who will decide whether you want a company focused on
</I>&gt;<i> Macintosh through thick and thin, or a Windows transplant that comes
</I>&gt;<i> and goes, independent of your wants and needs. If you want MacSpeech
</I>&gt;<i> and Macintosh focused companies like us, it would help to constantly
</I>&gt;<i> make Apple aware that is preferable to a &quot;big name Windows
</I>&gt;<i> transplant&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your support, apologies to those who feel that this post
</I>&gt;<i> wasted their time. No flames to the list please.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (now back to coding!)
