<PRE>  The following is a discussion that I've been having on a separate 
list. I would appreciate any advice regarding desktop microphones and 
how accurate they would be with speech recognition.

Thanks very much.

Norm

Hi Charlie,

Yes, using the headset attached to a desktop stand is tricky. You have 
to bend the mic arm until it's just in the right position. Of course, 
the ear phones are useless because they're taped to the stand.

I would definitely like to know more about the M560 that you talked 
about. Does anyone have more information and does it worked with OS 10.2.2?

Thanks,

Norm
