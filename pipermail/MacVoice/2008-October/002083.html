<PRE>All:

I'd like to remind everyone I am no longer an employee of MacSpeech,  
but I am a shareholder and user of the software, so I wanted to share  
my thoughts on the subject of the new version crashing. In order to  
stay under the 5K limit for messages posted to the list, I will need  
to break this into 2 parts.

First, overwhelmingly, people seem satisfied with the new release. I  
have seen only isolated problems reported on the Internet. Twitter  
(the micro-blogging service) has been buzzing lately with people who  
seem very happy with the release. So obviously, those who are  
experiencing problems seem to be in the minority (either that, or the  
vast majority of those who are having problems aren't speaking up -  
and we all know THAT doesn't happen). So, I think it is safe to say  
MacSpeech did not release a widespread lemon with this release. (My  
update is working extremely well, btw.)

So, for those who are having problems, I might suggest the following:  
Let's say that many, many years ago you bought a new car and you just  
weren't happy with it. In fact, you seemed to take be taking it back  
to the dealership every week with some new malady and they never did  
get it quite right. So when it came time to buy a new car, you bought  
one from another company, that, for whatever reason, you really didn't  
want to support, but at least you knew the car you were buying would  
work, even if the chassis it was on maybe didn't provide the most  
comfortable ride.

Continued in Part 2...
