<PRE>Hello.  Has anyone had problems transcribing a digital tape recording of 
dictation as an AIFF file to iListen and a word processing document?  I have had 
endless trouble (even with the latest release) with the dictation from the AIFF 
file not appearing in the word processing document window, after many 
unsuccessful attempts, often even after many restarts of all programs. Sometimes text 
appears in the &quot;I heard&quot; floating window, and as often it does not; with no 
text appearing in TextEdit, MS Word , documents;  - (often the &quot;I heard&quot;  
dialogue box never appears itself).  

And has anyone had trouble with the Correction Window text &quot;jumping around&quot; 
skipping portions of the AIFF file and at all times losing tracking of the 
voice playback -- the dictation playback audio source being found several lines 
away from the dictated sentences or repeating the first lines over and over?

I have not been able to use ilisten with the Olympus tape recorder purchased 
with iListen for the nearly two years I have owned them.  Any ideas?  

Chuck has asked that I send in an Aiff file for tech support to try to figure 
it out.  I have not had time to do that as yet.  It takes many hours in any 
attempt to transcribe one short tape.  

(Chuck, sorry this has not been accomplished yet.  The bugs I have outlined 
with you have never changed.  I have simply stopped using the program until I 
have the time to work this out.  I just want to keep this case in the loop.  
Nothing has changed.}

Many thanks,

Lorin
