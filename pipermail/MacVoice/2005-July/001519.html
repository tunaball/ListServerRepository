<PRE>All:

The Plantronics Audio .85 is the first headset we have certified for  
use with iListen. All others we have tested did not meet our testing  
parameters. For what it is worth, we have 3-5 employees test a  
headset before it can be certified. In order to be certified, a  
headset must get reasonably good accuracy for at least 3 MacSpeech  
employees, and be relatively easy to set up.

This does not mean that absolutely no other microphone will work with  
iListen. We have many customers using microphones from Andrea or  
Plantronics who are very happy with them. All we are stating is that  
if you have a non-certified headset and come to us complaining that  
your accuracy is poor, our first response will be that you should be  
using a MacSpeech-certified headset (since no amount of twiddling  
with the software settings will compensate for poor input).

The issue is that most headsets are made with Windows machines in  
mind, not Macs. Mac OS X likes a more robust audio signal (in  
general) than PCs.

Regarding the USB adapters that ship with our products, none require  
batteries. If you have a headset that has a box for batteries, this  
is actually a pre-amp that boosts the signal a little (and also  
reduces the power drain when a PowerBook or iBook is being used on  
battery-only power). All of the USB adapters we sell get their power  
directly from the USB port itself.

Finally, there are always two places you can download the latest  
version of iListen on our web site. From our Upgrade Center, and from  
our Support site. We do this on purpose for the convenience of our  
customers. Here are instructions for getting to both locations:

1). On our home page (www.macspeech.com), scroll down a bit and at  
the bottom of the section regarding iListen (usually the first  
section, but not always) find the words &quot;Upgrade Center&quot; and click it.

2). Click the word &quot;Support&quot; at the top of any MacSpeech web page.  
Then click the word &quot;Downloads&quot; on the main Support page. You may  
have to scroll down to find the latest updater.

Chuck Rogers, Chief Evangelist

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What Microphones are supported by iListen
</I>&gt;<i> iListen supports the use of microphones from VXi, Telex and  
</I>&gt;<i> MacMice. The VXi TalkPro and TalkPro Xpress provide the highest  
</I>&gt;<i> quality sound and best noise cancellation. iListen does NOT support  
</I>&gt;<i> the use of microphones from well known manufacturers such as  
</I>&gt;<i> Labtec, Plantronics and Andrea. Microphones from those  
</I>&gt;<i> manufacturers work well in many circumstances on the Mac, but  
</I>&gt;<i> function poorly with iListen. The Griffin iMic USB Adaptor went  
</I>&gt;<i> through a design change and is no longer compatible with iListen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The headset speaker in these headsets is not necessary for speech  
</I>&gt;<i> recognition.&quot; (Underline of &quot;Plantronics&quot; was mine.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perfect.  At least they'll do with the iChat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, what I went there for initially was to get the free update to  
</I>&gt;<i> 1.6.8, but it just gives me where to BUY.... Uh, yet it does say  
</I>&gt;<i> 'free' to us who already own iListen 1.6.6. Where's the quick link  
</I>&gt;<i> to upgrade, Please?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (The thing I mainly disliked about the included headset with  
</I>&gt;<i> iListen is the HUGE USB adapter box -Parrott?- which needs  
</I>&gt;<i> Batteries!)  Plantronics are White, I can see where they lay around  
</I>&gt;<i> my desk, small mute/volume controller, small USB 'adapter' but with  
</I>&gt;<i> my G5 I have audio in and audio out jacks. I'd had hopes that  
</I>&gt;<i> could've worked without USB entirely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far the only thing I have which signals it is working is the  
</I>&gt;<i> internal mic in the iMac G5.
