All Serial Midi interfaces are working with OS X using the Stealth port on a
G4, a G5 version will be available soon !
You must set your midi interface to MTP mode !

If you have some problems contact me directly

</I>&gt;<i> Well, there it is. The problem I was afraid of. Nope, I did not load
</I>&gt;<i> any drivers for the Opcode MidiPort 96 because there are none. Just as
</I>&gt;<i> you said, Opcode is long gone and the &quot;driver&quot; needed to recognize this
</I>&gt;<i> midi hardware is OMS in System 9. In System X there is no OMS so I
</I>&gt;<i> guess that's why there will be no recognition of it. Somehow, I thought
</I>&gt;<i> that Core Audio and OSX Midi had all this stuff &quot;built in&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> automatic. I didn't realize you still needed drivers for your hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> I was under the impression that OSX automatically recognized any midi
</I>&gt;<i> gear that was hooked up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, that's why I've been pulling my hair out. No driver for my
</I>&gt;<i> beautiful Opcode midi interface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone know of any suggestions other than buying a brand new rack mount
</I>&gt;<i> 8x8 interface? That's an investment I don't want to make when this one
</I>&gt;<i> is staring at me in my rack already.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My current solution?
</I>&gt;<i> I have gotten so fed up trying to make the switch over to X for audio
</I>&gt;<i> for so many reasons that I finally just decided enough was enough. I
</I>&gt;<i> had bought a brand new dual processor 1GHZ G4 (that I am writing on at
</I>&gt;<i> this moment) and retired my BELOVED Beige G3 300mhz MT to another room
</I>&gt;<i> as a server. I was running Cubase 4.1 (THE most stable Cubase ever) and
</I>&gt;<i> of course all of my midi hardware on it for 5 years. Never had a CPU
</I>&gt;<i> problem, never had a speed problem. It was perfect. I was looking
</I>&gt;<i> forward to producing audio on my new 22&quot; Cinematic Display but all that
</I>&gt;<i> has changed....
</I>&gt;<i> The G3 is BACK in the studio. The Opcode is running beautifully thru
</I>&gt;<i> the USB card and OMS in System 9. I took my MOTU PCI 324 card out of
</I>&gt;<i> the new G4 and put it back home in the G3. I've got my old 20&quot; CRT
</I>&gt;<i> monitor hooked up and a secondary 17&quot; like the old days. OS 9 is
</I>&gt;<i> running like a charm and writing, creating, and producing audio is
</I>&gt;<i> smooth like the old days. Until OSX becomes less of a hassle my studio
</I>&gt;<i> stays this way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right beside my setup is the big Cinematic Display and G4 running OSX.
</I>&gt;<i> Why don't I just boot into 9 and use a faster computer? Because that's
</I>&gt;<i> a hassle too. I love the beauty of OSX and iChat, iPhoto, iDVD, Mail,
</I>&gt;<i> Address Book, and all the wonderful things I've grown to enjoy. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> want to reboot each time I choose to do a bit of audio or midi only to
</I>&gt;<i> have to keep switching when I want to utilize features in OSX.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, this has become my official &quot;Video Station&quot; and the G3 sits right
</I>&gt;<i> next to it as the Audio Station. In X I have no problems with Final Cut
</I>&gt;<i> Pro or iMovie so I'll use it for what it's good for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've said this before....Apple sometimes steps backwards in their
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;upgrades&quot;. The Beige G3 is a gem and no other computer has been as
</I>&gt;<i> desirable. It has the AV Personality Card which are the 6 RCA jacks for
</I>&gt;<i> audio and video AND an S-video jack as well. I don't know why Apple
</I>&gt;<i> stopped making things that we can all use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll get off my soapbox now. Thanks for listening. If anyone else is
</I>&gt;<i> having trouble doing what you do best on your newfangled, fancy
</I>&gt;<i> schmancy super fast computer than dust off the old workhorse that
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully you kept around. Life will get sweet again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But my question still remains.....any thoughts on where I may be able
</I>&gt;<i> to find drivers for the Opcode interface just the same? There have to
</I>&gt;<i> be a fair amount of Opcode interfaces out there that people are using.
</I>&gt;<i> And SOMEDAY I'd like to be able to use X!!!!!
