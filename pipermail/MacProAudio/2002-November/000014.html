<PRE>Hello Fellow Mac Speedsterz...

I bought my powerbook for ONE thing:  MUSIC PRODUCTION

When the Ti 400's and 500's came out it decided by many that the power  
book had finally come-of-age for portable music production - enough  
proc. power and drive space etc...


I was thrilled!  So i waited for the next gen. machines (not going to  
buy first rev.) then the Ti550 and 667's were announced...  i bought.

and I both experience and read that the 550's and 667's are NO  
comparison to the 400's and 500's...

I feel like Apple was misleading (or elusively-leading) in their  
advertisement of the next gen. of machines.  The machine i bought which  
should be faster than the prev. models is actually considerably slower.

I read the following and was wondering if anyone will comment on this?

======================================================================== 
==

&gt;<i> Memory Bandwidth and Logic Audio Tests: (from the 12/14/2001  
</I>&gt;<i> www.xlr8yourmac.com news page.)
</I>&gt;<i> Regular readers here know that since the first 7450 G4 based Macs were  
</I>&gt;<i> released there's been comments on much much lower than expected memory  
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth compared to the G4 7400/7410 CPUs. (The 7410/7400 G4s had  
</I>&gt;<i> dramatically higher bandwidth - nearly 100MB/sec more in some tests.)  
</I>&gt;<i> A first report on the 2.1 stepping 7450 seemed to show this was fixed,  
</I>&gt;<i> but tests I've run since then show the rates are still much lower even  
</I>&gt;<i> with 2.1 rev 7450s compared to external L2 cache/shorter pipeline  
</I>&gt;<i> 7400/7410s. (There have been discussions on this many times since the  
</I>&gt;<i> beginning of the year about compiler optimizations, etc. which is too  
</I>&gt;<i> long to discuss here). My comments above noted my PB G4/400 had much  
</I>&gt;<i> higher memory bandwidth than the PB G4/667 (2001).
</I>&gt;<i> A reader sent an email tonight on why the much lower memory bandwidth  
</I>&gt;<i> of the new PowerBook G4/550 and G4/667 models (compared to the PB  
</I>&gt;<i> G4/400 and /500 models which use the 7410 CPU) make the earlier  
</I>&gt;<i> Powerbooks a better choice for Logic Audio.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Update: I've added a reader's results with the 2002 PB G4/800 to the  
</I>&gt;<i> listing below. For other PB G4/800 2002 model tests, see this &gt; article.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot; Hi - though you might like to have this info - I and a few others  
</I>&gt;<i> have been doing some testing on the old Powerbook G4/500 vs the new  
</I>&gt;<i> 550 &amp; 667.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Memory bandwidth on the 550/667 is a *lot* lower than on the 500 - the  
</I>&gt;<i> new 7440 CPU is to blame, not the amount of cache. The older 7410 CPU  
</I>&gt;<i> is better - we've measured memory bandwidth at 230MB/sec on the  
</I>&gt;<i> 400/500, vs 145MB/sec on the 550/667.
</I>&gt;<i> [Again this is not news to regular readers here and was noted in my  
</I>&gt;<i> earlier comments above comparing the PB G4/667 (2001) to my PB G4/400.  
</I>&gt;<i> It's good to see an example of where this has an actual applications  
</I>&gt;<i> impact.-Mike]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What this means is that for audio use, where many simultaneous  
</I>&gt;<i> realtime DSP processes are required, the old PBG4/500 will perform  
</I>&gt;<i> significantly *better* in many operations than either the 550 or the  
</I>&gt;<i> 667.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A simple test using simultaneous stereo Platinumverbs in Logic Audio  
</I>&gt;<i> 4.7.3:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *	PB G4/667 (2001) - 9 platinumverbs
</I>&gt;<i> *	PB G4/550 - 7 platinumverbs
</I>&gt;<i> *	PB G4/500 - 13(!) platinumverbs
</I>&gt;<i> *	PB G4/800 (2002) - 18 platinumverbs
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (He later said his Umax S900 w/<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/macproaudio.html">G4 at 473Mhz</A> managed 6 Platinumverbs on  
</I>&gt;<i> 67MB/sec memory bandwidth.-Mike)
</I>&gt;<i> We didn't test the PBG4/400, but it's likely that will also outperform  
</I>&gt;<i> the 550 and perhaps even the 667... Memory bandwidth is the key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While end-of-stock, secondhand, or refurbished PBG4/500 and PBG4/400s  
</I>&gt;<i> are available, they are a *much* better choice for audio work than the  
</I>&gt;<i> new 550 or 667... The 400/500 also have the advantage of allowing the  
</I>&gt;<i> processor speed to be reduced which increases battery life &amp;  
</I>&gt;<i> eliminates fan noise - the 550/667 do not allow this I believe.
</I>&gt;<i> John Pitcairn &quot;
