<PRE>Generally speaking, Macs are substantially quieter than PCs.

There was one recent Mac, I think it was the original G5 tower, which 
was very noisy and that attracted a great deal of criticism but Apple 
revised the design and dealt with the problem.

Apple have always taken acoustic noise levels very seriously. After the 
bondi blue iMac, G3 iMacs had no cooling fan. The new G5 iMacs have a 
very sophisticated cooling system to minimise noise - which is very 
important if the whole computer sits a foot in front of your face.

In a studio context, I would hope that you have no equipment with 
cooling fans or hard disks in an area where microphones are used. 
Whatever manufacturers claim, they are not silent. Even transformers in 
power supplies and lighting fittings have been found to vibrate and be 
audible.

Presumably you're concerned about acoustic noise within the control 
room. I would have thought that the ideal solution is to put all 
equipment with fans into racks that have doors ( with the rack being 
independently ventilated ). That way it's accessible but not audible.

Much depends on the level that you monitor at. At high levels, even a 
quite noisy PC isn't troublesome, but at low levels, you can hear all 
sorts of things.

I'm puzzled why your colleague is so keen on PCs for audio.  OS X has 
many advantages for high quality audio and the new version of OS X will 
further strengthen support for pro audio.
