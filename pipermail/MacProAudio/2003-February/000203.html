<PRE>&gt;<i>Save the conversion to 16 bits for CDs for the very last step. 
</I>&gt;<i>However, I don't have enough experience to know whether this is in 
</I>&gt;<i>fact a practical consideration.
</I>
	I'm doing everything 24-bit now... the only thing that's 
really changed for the 'worse' is the file size... my Mac seems to be 
handling everything fine.  I haven't done a test to see how many 
tracks I can actually record and/or play back at once, but I've never 
made the processor meters (or my Ultra 160 SCSI drives) sweat yet. 
The ONLY processor-oriented limitation I've run into so far has been 
with plug-ins... usually AltiVerb.

	Another benefit of 24-bit recording - I spend a lot less time 
worrying about getting mic preamp levels as hot as I can without 
clipping... with a little more headroom, I'm finding myself hardly 
EVER sticking my tail between my legs and asking players and singers 
(and myself) for &quot;one more take for me because we're now playing 
louder than we did during sound check and my peak LEDs are starting 
to blink at me&quot;.  The downside of this is that people who work in 16 
bits take a while to get used to the idea of letting something fly 
with levels that average around -24 and peak at around -6.  We're 
STILL exceeding CD's 96dB of dynamic range, and I just LOVE not 
having to face digital distortion the next day when I examine tracks.

	Though it's still fairly new for me, I couldn't be happier 
with archiving to DVD-R.  It took away all my concerns about moving 
up to 24-bit, and it solved my problem of not being able to archive 
audio Image Files onto CD-R that were longer than 70 minutes.  Plus, 
it's drastically reducing the amount of physical space required to 
archive projects.
