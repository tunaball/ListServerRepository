<PRE>I have the audio interface; I also have a pre - amp. CDs are cheap. One 
doesn't need much HD, as one can burn then discard the data from the 
HD. I have three HDs (one 10GB in the Powerbook), but an 80GB in the 
tower and also an 80GB in a firewire case. And I have burners as well. 
Plus some of the LPS, expecailly some '60's symphony ones, are far 
superior to CD recordings, being beautifully recorded analogue tracks.

My time's worth a heap, but then I'll connect the powerbook to the 
pre-amp and just play the record. The time will be the setting up of 
the record - no big deal. I'll put the music onto either the external 
firewire drive, and then connect that to the desktop mac. I am going to 
airport this house, which would bypass the need for  firewire method of 
data transfer (or use the Powerbook as an external hard disk).

OK I am organised on those fronts.

But I'd like the de scratch software most of all. And having one in 
system X is better I think.

I could use my son's notebook: it has firewire, and on the PC, there's 
lots of cheap de scratch software. But for the Mac, there's not much 
around it seems.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are you sure you want to do this?  Keep in mind that you have to do

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your computer, figure at least an hour/CD to &quot;clean up&quot; the tracks 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and burn the CD.  So if you are very efficient 200 hours for this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You need: (assuming you have a CD burner)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an audio interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> audio software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hard drive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 100 CD blanks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes a new hard drive. To convert 100 albums to CD quality sound you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will need about 50 gig's of space. (CD Stereo audio is 10 MB/min)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So figure about $500.00- $600.00  to get everything you need.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then figure what tying up your computer and 200 hours of your time is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worth.   ($10.00/ hour? = $2000.00)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So about $2,500.00 (25.00/CD) to wind up with 100 CD's that I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guarantee will be of lower quality than commercial CD's.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Consider replacing your collection with CD's.
