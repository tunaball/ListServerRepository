<PRE>Hi Lukas,

I'm a little more confused now as to what you are after...

You want a cartridge with &quot;umph&quot; and &quot;kick&quot;? What do you mean by that?

You said in your original post you want something that is of high
quality. I would think you would want a cartridge that does not color
your sound. Most decent cartridges have flat freq response. In fact,
while I haven't followed the audiophile market real close lately, I
wouldn't think there are any cartridges on the market that would
purposely color freq response.

I was the one who asked about your receiver...Again, although your
Kenwood isn't a McIntosh (although the difference between them and most
other brands is nothing like what it was 20 years ago), I would think
you'll have less distortion and coloration of sound that going through
all the mixing equipment.

So, I'm not sure if you want to have the audio as &quot;original&quot; as
possible, or whether you purposely want to modify things.
