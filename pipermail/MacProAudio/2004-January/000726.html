  The AppleLoop format is supported, yes, and you can create your own. I 
believe the Soundtrack Loop Utility comes with SoundTrack. I doubt 
you'll find it included with GarageBand, but that's just a hunch. 
However, it *IS* available as a SDK from Apple (although specifically 
mentioned on that page that it's NOT intended for end users... :-) and 
you can make your own loops with it.

&gt;&gt;<i>  Also the question has come up of how many of the &quot;apple loops&quot; are

  Indeed. People got what they want, felt it was a fair price, and 
complain later that market conditions or other business decisions were 
made. I've never understood that viewpoint because if you felt 
something was a horrible value, you shouldn't have bought it. Better 
deals ALWAYS come along and you just have to live with it. :^)

  Consider that GarageBand comes with ~1,000 samples for $49.95.  
Soundtrack comes with ~4,000.

  You can add an additional ~2,000 loops to GarageBand for $99.95, 
bringing the price up to ~$150, and you are still 1,000 samples less 
than Soundtrack. I think that at that point, Soundtrack has enough 
extra features that you can say it's still a very fair value for the 
price if you are interested in doing that kind of work. I mean, it even 
supports 126 tracks instead of 64 in GarageBand, etc... Truly it is a 
Pro level application with a much larger scope. I wouldn't confuse 
GarageBand with a pro app.
