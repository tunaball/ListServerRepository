</I>&gt;<i> Your concern is the lament of all Mac pro audio users.   OS X has been

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MOTU showed DP for OS X at the NAMM show this year, and their latest 
</I>&gt;<i> ETA for DP is &quot;early 2003&quot;.   Your frustration is shared by many.  As 
</I>&gt;<i> for your request for information from MOTU, they are well known for 
</I>&gt;<i> their crummy communication.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still boot into OS 9 to use DP.  It doesn't work with classic.   It 
</I>&gt;<i> is a pain, but I am reluctant to switch platforms, so I wait.........
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;Musikmesse&quot; (world's largest music products show) started today 
</I>&gt;<i> in Frankfurt.  Perhaps there will be an announcement from there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as switching to another platform, that is a matter of personal 
</I>&gt;<i> taste.  Logic, DP and Cubase all have their strengths and weaknesses, 
</I>&gt;<i> but there is a rational for going to Logic.  Apple bought Logic last 
</I>&gt;<i> year, so you know that their products will always be up to date with 
</I>&gt;<i> respect to OS.  Logic for OS X is shipping and most reports indicate 
</I>&gt;<i> that it is working well with Jaguar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I believe all these products have competitive upgrades. Check their 
</I>&gt;<i> websites.

</I>&gt;<i> These two discussion forms are more active than this MacProAudio.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have recently moved from hard disc recording to DAW and I am

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only OS9 app I use. Logic 6, Pro Tools, and CuBase are all now on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OSX. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> must admit, I haven't put much time into DP because of the OS9 issue. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bought DP I was told the OSX version was imminent.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As we all know this is not the case. MOTU has been unresponsive to my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inquiries about the timeline. I don't want to invest any more time or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> money
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in DP if they can't make their move soon. Any ideas on why I should 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consider
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Logic 6 or the others? Are there competitive upgrades? Are there real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advantages with each based on recording instruments versus MIDI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just want to get this dialog moving in case there are others like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are new and frustrated by the OSX audio road map. I want to create
