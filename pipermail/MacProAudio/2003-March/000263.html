<PRE>Rick,

Your concern is the lament of all Mac pro audio users.   OS X has been 
(and still is) a difficult road for audio.

MOTU showed DP for OS X at the NAMM show this year, and their latest 
ETA for DP is &quot;early 2003&quot;.   Your frustration is shared by many.  As 
for your request for information from MOTU, they are well known for 
their crummy communication.

I still boot into OS 9 to use DP.  It doesn't work with classic.   It 
is a pain, but I am reluctant to switch platforms, so I wait.........

The &quot;Musikmesse&quot; (world's largest music products show) started today in 
Frankfurt.  Perhaps there will be an announcement from there.

As far as switching to another platform, that is a matter of personal 
taste.  Logic, DP and Cubase all have their strengths and weaknesses, 
but there is a rational for going to Logic.  Apple bought Logic last 
year, so you know that their products will always be up to date with 
respect to OS.  Logic for OS X is shipping and most reports indicate 
that it is working well with Jaguar.

  I believe all these products have competitive upgrades. Check their 
websites.

These two discussion forms are more active than this MacProAudio.
