<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey guys!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyone in here using  the FW-1884 with their OSX 10.2.8 setup?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I just got one and it, so far is very cool, minus some occasional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dropouts...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> Hey, I've been looking at that item; tell me all about it! I've been itching
</I>&gt;<i> to hear some user experiences with it. What software are you using? What all
</I>&gt;<i> do you use it for? And what are these dropouts you're speaking of?
</I>&gt;<i>

Well I so far love it!

I am running Logic 6.3.1/OSX 10.2.8 on a DP 1.25GHZ G4.
So far I've used it to convert my old Tascam688 analog vocal a cappella tracks to digital. I did a
tape/direct out of the 688 into the 8-balanced ins on the FW1884 into Logic. All 8 tracks imported
simultaneously and flawlessly into Logic. My understanding is in addition to Phantom power on all
channels, it has a guitar input for that below level line and a switch so you can flip it between
guitar or line/mic. I have not hooked a guitar up to it yet, but have sang vocals in and it sounds
great. 

Now the audio dropouts occured when I soloed trakcs in Logic to listen to them. The audio would just
drop and then it came back. It was random, but it did only happen when I solo'd tracks. It wasn't
frequent enough to cause alarm, but an oddity I would like to get remedied. There is nothing like
recording tracks while listening to others or even mixing down, trying to fix a track or trial
effects and the audio disappears on you. BUT having said all that the audio is clean with no real
crazy mechanical buzz, although I did hear some, it could be my rig. Its got 8 XLR and 1/4&quot; and you
can actually get 18simultaneous ins. It works great as a monitor mixer too without it attached to
the computer. I tested that with my setup and it works. The LED meters are great and are pretty
accurate in their representation of level.

For me where it shines the most is the Control Surface(drool...100mm motorized faders!!!!!) I'm a
tech geek so I like the automation of it, and believe me its well worth the geeky discovery. It
works flawlessly with Logic 6.3.1 after installing the plug-in. Move your fader on screen with your
mouse and the motorized fader on the FW18884 follows :) The one issue I have is that datawheel,
while it is fantastic, it is VERY sensitive. You can move pretty quickly across your data increments
so having a steady hand is key there. The shuttle option is great and I love being able to move the
the song pointer in real time..like a record player :)

MIDI worked as it should and because it has 4in/out it is very flexible. Currently I had only one
unit plugged in directly but it all worked fine. FW1884 has a midi merge and route function which I
have not tried yet, but it sounds as if it will serve as a pretty good mini-MIDI patch bay.

Anyway so far I would rate this unit pretty high on the must have list. For the price you truly do
GET 3 in 1.

Hope this wets your appetite!
