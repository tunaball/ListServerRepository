<PRE>
&gt;<i>Thanks to those who helped me through my minor problems, I got
</I>&gt;<i>GarageBand to do what I needed it to do, although I missed a few
</I>&gt;<i>features PTFree had, namely:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>ability to edit the waveform itself (I didn't need it this time, but it
</I>&gt;<i>has helped with some spikes in the past)
</I>
It is possible to do simple edits, as you know. Editing is in what Pro
Tools would call Slip mode. You can then butt the results together.
Certainly lacks the editing subtlety of PT.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>edit the waveform directly in the track (as opposed to in the editing
</I>&gt;<i>window at the bottom)
</I>
Sorry, not that I know of. You can move it in the main window, or
option-drag to copy it.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>ability to make the waveform TALL - this doesn't effect the function of
</I>&gt;<i>the waveform, but it gives a feeling of control.
</I>
Nope.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>ability to adjust the track volume when zoomed in very very close (it
</I>&gt;<i>just doesn't seem to work)
</I>
Haven't tried this.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>length in beats, etc... I am not a musician, so it would be nice to
</I>&gt;<i>have it in minutes. This is for audio (speech) editing.
</I>
Just to the right of the counter you'll see a little musical note. Click on
it, and the counter will become a real time clock.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One huge file, instead of a folder with the individual files in it. If
</I>&gt;<i>I end up editing a conference, I am going to have to break the talks up
</I>&gt;<i>into small pieces, such that can fit one project on CD (no DVD-R). Does
</I>&gt;<i>an Archive do this?
</I>
See below, if I understand the question.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The exporting of two+ separate tracks in ONE project. Something along
</I>&gt;<i>the lines of a way to mark the timeline to export segments as Track 1,
</I>&gt;<i>Track 2, etc... PTFree would export each &quot;track&quot; on the timeline as
</I>&gt;<i>individual wav files, which was sometimes helpful, often too
</I>&gt;<i>troublesome.
</I>
A clumsy workaround is to create duplicate real instrument tracks (no
effects) and then drag the individual track there. Mute unwanted tracks and
export.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Is Soundtrack a bit more complicated (ie, better) than GarageBand?
</I>&gt;<i>Would it address my concerns above?
</I>
Soundtrack is strictly loops. No provision for recording, as far as I know,
though I haven't used it and I could be mistaken. No MIDI either. It does
support Quicktime video, and it has something GB lacks: Markers!

There are a couple of good books out there, and since GB is so cheap, it's
worth the investment in one of them. To get a good handle of all the iLife
apps, check out Jim Heid's iLife 04 book. If, like me, you're more attuned
to getting the most out of GB, I can recommend APPLE TRAINING SERIES:
GARAGE BAND by Mary Plummer (very detailed)$34.95 US, and GARAGE BAND
IGNITE! by Orren Merton at $19.95. The latter is a quickstart sort of thing
with lots of details, and each had info the other lacked.
