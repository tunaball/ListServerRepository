<PRE>	I guess 'perfect' is 'relative'...  :-)  If I've got a cold, 
I'm usually flat by about 20 cents... otherwise, I can hear if 
something's out if it's about 5 cents either way.  I'm much more 
accurate in the mornings after sleeping well.  I never need another 
external reference pitch.  The only times I have trouble is if I'm 
trying to identify material from one source and there is music 
playing from another source, particularly if it's louder - i.e., 
restaurant muzak while I'm composing.  I can easily create my own 
internal reference pitches or chords to get me back on track if 
needed.

	Contrary to what most people initially think, it really 
doesn't bug me that much if an instrument is out of tune or if 
somebody sings slightly off key.  I kindof allow for a certain amount 
of slippage... kindof like when a soprano substitutes an excessively 
wide vibrato for accuracy.  However, I cannot listen to Kenny G... he 
consistently plays about 8 or 9 cents sharp.  I keep waiting for him 
to even it out, but it never happens.  What's bright to one is an 
icepick to another.

	While the 'parlor tricks' wear off quickly (identifying 
notes, chords, intervals and the like, without a reference), I 
appreciate it the most when I'm composing, since I can hear the 
completed piece in my head at the correct pitch and write it down 
wherever I am, as long as I've got blank staff paper and a pen.  Many 
times, I compose directly into Finale when I'm at home, turning off 
the sound of my Mac and MIDI keyboard.  It's a little faster, but I 
still enjoy writing it out by hand the most.

	The hardest thing is for me to transpose by sight... can't do 
it.  If I see a C, I gotta play a C, and it's gotta sound like a C. 
I have tremendous respect for those who can transpose effortlessly. 
I suppose it's a fair tradeoff!  Our choir director occasionally 
transposes some of the shorter elements of our Church Services, and 
it really knocks me sideways... kindof like sight reading times four 
and a half.

&gt;<i>You Jedi, with your mind tricks.:-)
</I>&gt;<i>Just curious, how perfect is perfect? How many cents  does it take 
</I>&gt;<i>for you to hear that pitch is off and can you quantify it? And does 
</I>&gt;<i>it have to be relative to another pitch?
