listers,
	well, i finally got my upgrade to dp4, which is very exciting. 
replaced my amiii card with an m-audio quattro. plugged everything in 
and ran the driver installer from the cd. install seemed to go fine; it 
asked for a restart, which i ok'ed. however, when my g4 dp533 came back 
up, the m-audio driver cd was no longer mounted, even though it was 
still in the drive. hitting the eject key had no effect. finally, i ran 
disk utility, which saw and correctly identified the cd and reported 
that it was 'unmounted.' repeated attempts to use the 'mount command 
failed. the only way to eject the cd was to boot into os 9. when i was 
back in X, i tried inserting the cd again. it refused to mount, but at 
least i was able to eject it with disk utility's eject command.
	so...does anybody have any idea what went wrong? it is a small 
problem, since the quattro is functioning fine; but there is other 
software on the m-audio driver cd, which i'd like to take a look at. i 
supposed i could boot into 9 and copy it to my hard drive, but that 
seems kludgy.

thanks in advance,
tl
