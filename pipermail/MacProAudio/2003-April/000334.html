Well, print magazines go to print very early, so they often get it 
wrong. MOTU's been pretty far off on their projections, though, I'll 
agree. I'm also anxious to get Mach 5! Do they even have pricing for 
that yet?

I think a lot of people are waiting on DP4 for OS X. I've not heard 
very many people who switched DAWs in their migration to OS X -- as 
some had predicted. There's not been a max exodus to Logic, for 
example; if any software has picked up more users it's probably Cubase 
SX just because it's a much stronger release than previous versions, 
just anecdotally, though I have no idea what actual sales numbers are. 
People seem pretty loyal to their software of choice.

PT for OS X has shipped, though, I might add. I'll be trying that out 
soon, though I vastly prefer working in DP, even with projects that 
don't require MIDI.

Peter
