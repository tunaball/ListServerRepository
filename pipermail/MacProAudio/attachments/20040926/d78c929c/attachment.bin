Hi 

TODAY (in caps) you do not need to buy more the 3 GB of memory as
10.3.5 can handle only 2 Gb process

So if you use Logic or Cubase or Protools 2 GB are required for them
plus 500 GB for MAC OS X, you add a 500 MB for security that all


This should change with 10.4 (Tiger) but application has to be
corrected to use it !
