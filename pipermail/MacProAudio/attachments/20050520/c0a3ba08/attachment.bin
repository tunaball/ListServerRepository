My professional musician friend who I wooed over from the PC side is
after comparable sound program to something he used on his PC.
Something called Sound Forge 4.5 I understand it to be a full featured
stereo waveform editor, as in mastering software, not a multitracker.
Something afforable. Shareware etc. He has tried out Sound Studio and
it doesn't offer up the same feature set. I am hoping the legends on
this list will have the answer.


Thanks in advance.

Rod


BTW: He is now a HUGE Mac fan.
