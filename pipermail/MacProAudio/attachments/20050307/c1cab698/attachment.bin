Hi David,


 I am having the same problem. I wish I had an answer. i am using the
M-Audio audiophile with my G4 and I go through my EV mixer. It is
driving me crazy with the hum.


If you find a solution, would you mind sharing? I will certainly do
the same.


Thanks and good luck

<excerpt>Hi all, is anyone else experiencing sound problems in 10.3.8?
Is there a known problem?  I get low frequency hum from my connected
stereo, and feedback buzz from my plugged in guitar.


running this on both a 17" powerbook and a G5 2.5. The guitar is
connected to an M-Audio Firewire 410.


Thanks


David
