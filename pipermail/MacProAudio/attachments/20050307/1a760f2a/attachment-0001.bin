<excerpt>Hi all, is anyone else experiencing sound problems in 10.3.8?
Is there

a known problem?  I get low frequency hum from my connected stereo, and

feedback buzz from my plugged in guitar.


running this on both a 17" powerbook and a G5 2.5. The guitar is

connected to an M-Audio Firewire 410.


Thanks

It sounds like what you're experiencing is a ground loop. Make sure
that

everything in your computer system and your audio chain (interface,
mixer,

etc.) is using the same A.C. electrical circuit ... use one or more
power

bars if needed and have them all going to one plug-in at the end.


Alternatively, if the M-Audio interface or any of your other audio
equipment

has a ground lift switch, lift the ground to see if that solves the
problem.
