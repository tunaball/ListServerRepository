A colleague has proposed a PC based system [ I won't be doing that :)]
but he also raised the issue of whether the Mac we choose may be noisy
? CAn anyone help me with the some advice on how to keep down noise
and is the Mac especially noisy ?


</excerpt>I will not argue with what your friend said about MAC, but I
have serious doubts, the G5 is not noisy compared to the G4

You have 2 solution, either you buy a cabinet to put your G5 ( Omnirax
has nice one) or you put it in a separate room

If you can afford a Protools system go for it, otherwise the solution
Motu (PCI) + Logic is a very good ration quality/price
