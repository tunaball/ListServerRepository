<PRE>&gt;<i> The recording setup is pure simple -Plug into the RCA tape outputs from
</I>&gt;<i> the rack using  RCA cables to a RCA to phono plug adapter cable to the
</I>&gt;<i> microphone jack on the laptop. The current maximum cable length is
</I>&gt;<i> 30ft. Currently using AudioIn to record input.
</I>&gt;<i> After capturing entire sermon - burning it to audio CD.
</I>&gt;<i> ======================
</I>
I think you should be able to get considerably more than 30 ft of usable
cable length, if you're dealing with a line-level signal coming out of those
RCA jacks...  I remember doing a DJ gig years ago (in a showroom at a big
hotel) where their audio guy took the line-out from my mixer, and ran a
cable several hundred feet, to reach their audio system input... and it
sounded fine.

Maybe using heavier, well-shielded microphone cable (XLR type) would give
you more range. Another option would be to get two cheap mixers, and use one
at each end, to give you a low impedance signal (running the rack-out RCA's
into the first mixer, then taking a mic level output) and running that nice
fat mic cable as far as you want, into the other cheap mixer, which would
then boost you back to a signal level appropriate for input into the Pismo.
Sounds complicated, but it really isn't too bad -- and it would definitely
be the &quot;inexpensive&quot; solution.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the future - Is there a way to use a WIFI network to wirelessly
</I>&gt;<i> extend from the sound rack and remotely record the service on the
</I>&gt;<i> laptop? I would like to be able to get 100 to 150ft range.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my limited networking experience, the only way I could figure out
</I>&gt;<i> how to do it - is to put another laptop next to the sound rack and use
</I>&gt;<i> it as the server for recording. I would use the WIFI net to remote
</I>&gt;<i> control the server.
</I>
The dual-laptop theory would seem to be the most complicated -- and
certainly most expensive -- solution.  I think you might be better off with
a wireless audio system, like the ones that guitarists use to connect with
amps or audio racks that are offstage, often quite a distance away. Here's a
link (I hope it come through in a useable form) to take a look at a
Sennheiser unit that might do the trick, for just under $300:
