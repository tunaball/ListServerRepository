<PRE>Hi Kathy,

Frustrating? Heck yes!
Unfair? Probably not.

You might want to take a look at the license agreement that was 
included with the product. I'd be willing to bet that the license 
agreement says something similar to &quot;Educational versions cannot be 
upgraded.&quot; This is pretty typical for Educational products. Try reading 
Adobe's license agreement... it also includes a statement that 
Educational software cannot be resold at all.

In addition, most software companies will upgrade your *new* software, 
but the cutoff is usually 30 days. This really killed me when I bought 
Retrospect Server 5.1 ($549) for my school 40 days before the upgrade. 
They reconfigured the software so that there really isn't a comparable 
product... the &quot;upgrade&quot; (really a new product) price was almost as 
much as the full price on the original product. Ugh.

I'm not saying that you asked for your situation, because you didn't. I 
am saying that there is no free lunch... and there's a reason that the 
software is so inexpensive for educational customers.

smiles,
Jamie &quot;Read your license agreement and weep&quot; Pruden
