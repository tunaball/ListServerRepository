<PRE>look at it this way - you'll still have paid less than full price
after the upgrade

&gt;<i> Just curious - wondering if I'm the only one that thinks this is
</I>&gt;<i> wrong....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I purchased Logic Express 6 from Apple about 45 days ago. Brand new. I
</I>&gt;<i> bought it thru the Education Store for $149 (regular pricing is $299).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Logic Express 7 just came out. I thought that since I just made this
</I>&gt;<i> brand new in the box purchase so recently that an upgrade at no cost
</I>&gt;<i> would be the appropriate thing to offer customers - say to those who
</I>&gt;<i> had just purchased their new software within 60 days of this revamped
</I>&gt;<i> version being released.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the website there IS an upgrade price of $99 for regular store
</I>&gt;<i> customers. That's 1/3 the cost of the whole program (at $299). So, I
</I>&gt;<i> then assumed that the upgrade price for those who paid $149 for the
</I>&gt;<i> whole program would also be 1/3 - which comes to $49.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no &quot;free&quot; upgrade if you just purchased Logic Express 6 before
</I>&gt;<i> the release of 7.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no &quot;$49&quot; upgrade if you want to move up to 7 from 6.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, if you shelled out the full $149 for the brand new version a
</I>&gt;<i> few weeks ago, you now must pay the $99 upgrade path that was
</I>&gt;<i> implemented for the $299 pricing OR you might even have to pay a whole
</I>&gt;<i> new $149 for the new Logic 7 because the $99 upgrade may not install or
</I>&gt;<i> be compatible with the &quot;academic&quot; priced Logic 6 (although I doubt this
</I>&gt;<i> theory since the box for Logic 6 still has eMagic on it and Made In
</I>&gt;<i> Germany and NO mention of Academic on it anywhere - I think Apple just
</I>&gt;<i> priced it academically but there probably is not any difference in
</I>&gt;<i> serial numbers etc...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Before I get branded as a complainer let me say that I do indeed
</I>&gt;<i> recognize the wonderful educational pricing of $149 for my software. I
</I>&gt;<i> thought I was making a great savings and great deal. I knew Logic 7
</I>&gt;<i> would be out someday but could not see it anywhere soon on the horizon
</I>&gt;<i> so I bought now. I appreciate that I have this at half price from
</I>&gt;<i> regular retail of $299. But let's be realistic about the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i> problem: Having to pay the same amount again or even $99 just to get
</I>&gt;<i> the latest version only weeks later seems quite unfair. If Apple
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't want to honor a 30 or 60 day arrangement for people who just
</I>&gt;<i> freshly bought this version of 6, well that's their choice. But at
</I>&gt;<i> least offer fair pricing for those of us who paid $149 just a few weeks
</I>&gt;<i> ago. I wouldn't squawk about paying $49 to get version 7. But having to
</I>&gt;<i> put out almost the same amount of money is ridiculous.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, my purchase of Logic Express 6 in August was a complete
</I>&gt;<i> burning of money. I have to rebuy it all over again because there is no
</I>&gt;<i> fair upgrade price or complimentary upgrade.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are many other software companies out there who offer free or
</I>&gt;<i> reduced price upgrades to their latest version for those people who
</I>&gt;<i> JUST freshly bought an outdated version. At the very least, if Apple
</I>&gt;<i> knew that Logic Express 7 was just weeks away from shipping out the
</I>&gt;<i> door, what kind of ethics do they have to continue selling Express 6
</I>&gt;<i> right up to the last minute with NO notice to customers that 7 will be
</I>&gt;<i> out within a month or so and that their purchase will be honored for a
</I>&gt;<i> free upgrade? They should have announced this and allowed people the
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to either wait for 7 or to purchase now and get a voucher
</I>&gt;<i> for a free upgrade to 7 or reduced price upgrade to 7 when it was
</I>&gt;<i> released.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am I the only one who thinks this timing loophole is a bit unfair?
