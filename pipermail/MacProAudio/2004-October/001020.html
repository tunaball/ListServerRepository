<PRE>Every year it comes around, the time when all of your major software 
programs become &quot;obsolete&quot; as the manufacturers  release a new improved 
version.  And every year the list and forums light up with people 
complaining about how they got caught in upgrade hell. Are you getting 
ripped off? Or is it a good idea to take advantage of the upgrade path?
Let's look at two of my favorites, Apple's Logic and Steinberg's (Now 
Pinnacle's) Cubase.
Both have a &quot;high end&quot; and &quot;mid-level&quot; product. For Logic, the &quot;soon to 
ship&quot; new versions are Logic Pro 7 at a whopping $999.00 (read $1K!) 
and Logic Express at $299. For Cubase the new versions are Cubase SX3 
at $799 and Cubase SL2 at $499.  I f last year you had bought the then 
current &quot;high end&quot; versions of these products, you would have shelled 
out  $949 for Logic Platinum or $599 for Cubase SX2. To upgrade to 
Logic Pro 7 from Platinum you're looking at $299 and to upgrade from 
Cubase SX2 to SX3 you're looking at $149.
In my opinion, I would pit Cubase SX against Logic Pro feature for 
feature any day. And to me ( although I haven't done it yet) the Cubase 
upgrade path seems reasonable. You pay $50 less for upgrading than 
buying the new version. On the Logic side of things, $1k for audio 
production software is outrageously expensive. And then to tag you for 
almost a third of that price for a upgrade is almost criminal. Is LP7 
$300 better than Platinum? Maybe. But the upgrade path is not very 
rewarding for product loyalty.
I f you look at the Logic line now, Apple has phased out the 
&quot;mid-level&quot; Logic Gold and  while Logic Express is touted as mid level 
we are really left with an  &quot;entry-level&quot; product.  Logic Express at 
$299 is  twice as much as the &quot;entry level&quot; $149 Cubase SE!  Now I am 
an Apple fan, but someone there had better take a look around at the 
competition. You can even get into Pro Tools LE with the M-box included 
for $500. (BTW Digidesign is even worse, upgrade wise)
Bottom line? You have to chose your product and the time to buy it 
carefully in the first place and then decide If the upgrade path is 
worthwhile for your product.
