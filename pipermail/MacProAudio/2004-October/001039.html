<PRE>Hi all,

First, a quick thanks to all the replies in regards to my last post 2 
weeks ago about the Logic Express 7 upgrade pricing.

Do any of you know or have an idea about Steinberg's Nuendo?

I just purchased, fresh and sealed in the box, a retail version of 
Nuendo 1.6. I know that it is not OSX compatible and only for OS9 but I 
bought it for a cheap upgrade path and I got a great price on it.

To get to Nuendo 2 would cost me $299 right now.

But Nuendo 3 is not far from release (and if any of you read my posts 
about getting caught in the worst possible timing with Logic Express 6 
you'll understand why I am asking this).

If I wait for version 3 do you think it will still be a $299 upgrade 
for version 1 owners to go directly to version 3?
Do you think there will ONLY be an upgrade path for owners of version 2 
forcing me to go thru 2 paid levels (pay for version 2 first and then 
again for version 3?).

Or do you think that version 2 to version 3 will be about $299 but 
maybe version 1 to version 3 will be $499 or something different?

I have been a Cubase user for years but I stopped with version 4.1 
because I stayed in OS9 longer than most. After I switched to OSX I 
ended up with Pro Tools and now Logic Express. But I have followed the 
Cubase SX upgrade news and see that SX1 users can upgrade to SX3 and 
that some SX2 users felt ripped that the upgrade price was the same for 
those who had already made at least one upgrade.

Anyhow, it's hard to guess what the Nuendo pricing might be. I could 
jump right up to version 2 now but with my luck version 3 will come 
within 6 weeks and I'll have to pay another $299 again. I'd rather sit 
on this original version 1 until version 3 comes out if I know for sure 
I can save a bundle by being patient.

Any thoughts on how it might  be handled when 3 does come out? Anyone 
know any timeframes?

Thanks in advance,
Kathy
