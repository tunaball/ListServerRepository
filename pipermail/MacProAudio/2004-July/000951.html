<PRE>Thanks, Colin,

I've reached a similar conclusion, re: USB v Firewire. However, I'm thinking 
of versatile studio and mobile solutions, and the non-USB selection seems 
limited.

I'm seeking users' opinions on the various apps and interfaces available. So 
far, Cubase, Digital Performer, Live, Logic and Metro have raised their 
heads. Steinberg's System 4, which combines Cubase SL with an audio/MIDI 
interface, seems to be a ready-made, integrated option. ProTools is always a 
front-runner on the audio side, but most of my current composition involves 
MIDI. help

Among interfaces, the M-audio FireWire 410 looks good, as does Mackie's 
Spike and M-Audio's Ozone, on the USB side. MIDI's the priority, with any 
interface that provides multiple ports (especially /outs/) looking better. 
Mic pre's are a necessity, since the interface will probably encounter a 
good deal of mobile use.

Thanks for your advice.

FWIW I find USB MIDI interfaces to be less than 100% reliable and would
prefer to get in to FireWire.

If you need versatile music scoring capabilities along with MIDI and
audio, then Cubase would do well. There are several versions and the
latest&#160; full app is very powerful but easy to learn and use the main
functions. There are whole areas in it that I don't need and have
forgotten how/never had the time to find out etc.

I haven't kept up with Logic as I need cross platform capability.

BTW your post seems to have acquired an embedded image which makes it
very hard to reply on this list.

Hope this helps,

Colin McDonald
