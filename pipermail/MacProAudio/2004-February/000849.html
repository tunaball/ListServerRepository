Thanks to everybody for replying. Kathy, I managed to hunt down the Core
Audio drive for Jaguar (which is what I'm now running) but haven't had a
chance to install or test it yet.

David, you mentioned that you are only able to get one app working at a
time, namely PT. Are you using the driver that PT installed or the
standalone Core Audio drive? Digidesign stuff has always been picky about
sharing their hardware. At work (using an M-Box system), if someone has
changed the output/input in the system sound preferences to the Digidesign
hardware and you try and start ProTools, it comes up with a &quot;hardware
already in use&quot; message, or it just quits with an unexplained error.
However, I believe other native apps (iTunes, Quicktime, system sounds,
etc.) should be able to share the hardware to some extent.

I'll have some time tomorrow to install and test, but don't have the OSX
version of ProTools yet, so won't be able to check that out.
