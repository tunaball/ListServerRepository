<PRE>	WEDNESDAY MAY 19

IT HAS BEEN CALCULATED THAT IF EVERYONE IN THE UNITED
STATES DID NOT PURCHASE A DROP OF GASOLINE FOR ONE DAY AND
ALL AT THE SAME TIME, THE OIL COMPANIES WOULD CHOKE ON
THEIR STOCKPILES.

AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD HIT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WITH A
NET LOSS OF OVER 4.6 BILLION DOLLARS WHICH AFFECTS THE
BOTTOM LINES OF THE OIL COMPANIES.

THEREFORE MAY 19TH HAS BEEN FORMALLY DECLARED &quot;STICK IT UP
THEIR behind &quot; DAY AND THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION SHOULD NOT
BUY A SINGLE DROP OF GASOLINE THAT DAY.

THE ONLY WAY THIS CAN BE DONE IS IF YOU FORWARD THIS E-MAIL
TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN AND AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN TO
GET THE WORD OUT.

WAITING ON THIS ADMIINSTRATION TO STEP IN AND CONTROL THE
PRICES IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
REDUCTION AND CONTROL IN PRICES THAT THE ARAB NATIONS
PROMISED WEEKS AGO?

REMEMBER ONE THING, NOT ONLY IS THE PRICE OF GASOLINE GOING
UP BUT AT THE SAME TIME AIRLINES ARE FORCED TO RAISE THEIR
PRICES, TRUCKING COMPANIES ARE FORCED TO RAISE THEIR PRICES
WHICH EFFECTS PRICES ON EVERYTHING THAT IS SHIPPED. THINGS
LIKE FOOD, CLOTHING, BUILDING MATERIALS, MEDICAL SUPPLIES
ETC. WHO PAYS IN THE END? WE DO!

WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IF THEY DON'T GET THE MESSAGE
AFTER ONE DAY, WE WILL DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.

MARK YOUR CALENDARS AND MAKE MAY 19TH A DAY THAT THE
CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES SAY &quot;ENOUGH IS ENOUGH



</PRE>
