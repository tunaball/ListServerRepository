</I>&gt;<i> It is depending how many tracks you want to play ;o)

</I>&gt;<i> ====================
</I>
Hi Cyril,

I hear ya, but keep in mind that needing to record 54 tracks at a time is a
situation that most of us will never be fortunate enough to experience! :-)

I run a MOTU 828 (FireWire interface) into an iMac G3 500; the 828 can
handle 8 inputs and 8 outputs (analog) simultaneously, and has never balked
when required to do so...  although to be honest, I rarely have used more
than the 2 outputs needed for stereo monitoring. For the work I do every day
(voiceover and small-studio music recording) the iMac/FW/828 combo has
proven to be rock solid, and a great bang-for-the-buck solution.

&gt;<i> ===================
</I>&gt;<i> I have moved to a G5 2x2 because of QLSO. On the beast you can
</I>&gt;<i> record up to 96 simultaneous tracks
</I>&gt;<i> On you Imac I doubt you could do this with a FW 400 interface.
</I>&gt;<i> ===================
</I>
Oh, I agree with you!  As an analogy, though, I could say that our Toyota
Camry is a great car... but I wouldn't take it to compete at Indy!  (...or
Le Mans...) Two entirely different playing fields -- and two correspondingly
different budgets! 

&gt;<i> ===================
</I>&gt;<i> I have friends having FW disk, FW audio on a PowerBook that have
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of problems.
</I>&gt;<i> ===================
</I>
That's surprising....  But (as I'm sure you know) there are so many
variables that can effect any computer-based system. I can tell you that I
have often run 2 FW hard drives, a DV-video input (FW), and the MOTU 828,
all simultaneously, and without any glitches whatsoever. I'm always amazed
at the FW HD's, which act as if they are internal drive units; totally
smooth input and output, it's as if they are &quot;part of the machine&quot;...


&gt;<i> ===================
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to do a song with 10 track a FW will do the job
</I>&gt;<i> But I have not seen any of this song lately ;o) you get song
</I>&gt;<i> with 40 track easily !
</I>&gt;<i> ===================
</I>
Again, I think it's like comparing the street in front of my house to the
Indianapolis Speedway!  :-)  Now also, keep in mind that I can do a song
with 40 tracks on my setup ---  just not 40 tracks of INPUT simultaneously!
But as I mentioned, I never realistically have the need to do 40 in at once.

Now recording an orchestra as you do, THAT would be different!


&gt;<i> ===================
</I>&gt;<i> With a Motu system you can start with one module and add up to 3
</I>&gt;<i> (4 in total), so your system can grow with.
</I>&gt;<i> ===================
</I>
Yes, I've been very happy with my MOTU product (and I've been lusting after
the new 828 Mk2!)  You can add/stack these units as well, for higher in/out
track count capabilities.

I have been EXTREMELY impressed and happy with FireWire as an input/output
protocol --- I almost can't imagine how fast FW 800 is going to feel!

Thanks for your &quot;input&quot;, Cyril!  I'll look forward to hearing some of the
orchestral music you've been working on!

All the best,

Gene
