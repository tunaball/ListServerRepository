<PRE>OK Peter. Point well taken. I'm just thinking that if someone is 
willing to wait a day, G3 compatibility is not an IMPOSSIBLE feat. I'm 
thinking of the tube iMac market. As for me, I'm a Cube driver and we 
are about to have dual 1.2 GHz Cubes from PowerLogix. So rendering the 
Movies and the MPEG-2 files will be pretty fast. Frustration is a good 
word to describe the feelings I have. Thanks.

A significant minority of us in the Cube world are searching for an OEM 
source of the 2x slot load DVD-R/CD-RW drive that Apple has just 
introduced in the 17&quot; Aluminum PowerBook so we can develop a Cube 
compatible mounting bracket for our Cubes to become iDVD 3 and total 
iLife compatible.

Steve's not God. Just a Son of a Gun.

</I>&gt;<i> A G3 processor is REALLY going to struggle with DVD burning, so

</I>&gt;<i> missing and that's because the G3 is way too slow for MPEG encoding 
</I>&gt;<i> and authoring.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for crippling compatibility with FireWire drives, I am frustrated 
</I>&gt;<i> by that. (See my article at www.powerpage.org on the new 
</I>&gt;<i> applications.) I have a LaCie FireWire drive plugged into my PowerBook 
</I>&gt;<i> G4/400 that has the same mechanism as the SuperDrive, and, sure, I 
</I>&gt;<i> want to use it! Another caveat, though: my G4/400 would certainly be 
</I>&gt;<i> PAINFUL for regular iDVD use. But it would be at least possible if 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple would allow it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, this is still not a standalone iDVD. As I learned so gently 
</I>&gt;<i> when I got flamed for writing a story Saturday in which I quoted CNET 
</I>&gt;<i> saying this is the first time Apple has charged for upgrades, it 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't. I should've remembered that iDVD 2 was also a fee upgrade. This 
</I>&gt;<i> is still an &quot;upgrade&quot; rather than a standalone product -- something 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple could stand to publicize better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Despite my frustration, let's keep in mind that Apple has squeezed 
</I>&gt;<i> slot-loading SuperDrives into PowerBooks starting at $2600 (after 
</I>&gt;<i> yesterday) and eMacs starting at $1500 (or is that $1700, can't 
</I>&gt;<i> recall). In other words, Jobs may not be God, but I say his eternal 
</I>&gt;<i> soul is probably safe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For now. :-)
