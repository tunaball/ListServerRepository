<PRE>Thank you Peter. That is an outstanding piece that gives me hope the 
transition will be sooner than later. But I do think there are a lot of 
pros that won't make the switch until OS X versions 2 or 3 of apps they 
depend on are proven to work flawlessly. And then there's the interface 
adjustment learning curve too. That's why I think it may be 2005 before 
the entire industry has switched. But I certainly hope it's sooner.

It will be interesting to see how quickly the diffusion will happen 
once all professional applications are fully operational with the 
existing hardware infrastructure. And I'm curious how much impact the 
IBM 970 PowerPC processor Macs will have on accelerating the switch 
curve as they enter the market in the last quarter of this year.

</I>&gt;<i> . . . just to name a few.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pro Tools is theoretically shipping now, though I haven't seen it in 
</I>&gt;<i> person. It should support all Digi hardware by the end of the spring.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And some major holdouts -- the Quarks of audio -- are due literally in 
</I>&gt;<i> the next 4 months, NOT the next 12 months:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Digital Performer
</I>&gt;<i> A NEW MOTU sampler we've never even had before (I'm looking forward to

</I>&gt;<i> MetaSynth (which has been tweaked now to run in Classic)
</I>&gt;<i> Reaktor
</I>&gt;<i> Absynth (I think - can't recall if that announcement was official)
</I>&gt;<i> Jitter (companion to MAX/MSP)
</I>&gt;<i> Pluggo -- meaning LOTS of plugins!
</I>&gt;<i> Mac-only AltiVerb reverb processor plugin
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first list means that many people are already running OS X. I have 
</I>&gt;<i> too many items on the second list -- and I expect I'm not alone on 
</I>&gt;<i> this list. But by Memorial Day at the latest I don't expect to be 
</I>&gt;<i> doing any audio booting into 9 -- and holdouts at that point will be 
</I>&gt;<i> cautious (nothing wrong with that) but hardly stranded in 9.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Developers have worked really hard on this getting things up to speed 
</I>&gt;<i> so quickly with a number of serious challenges. It's important to 
</I>&gt;<i> point out that I'm NOT saying it's taken this long to basically make X

</I>&gt;<i> MAJOR upgrades to existing software, and they do indeed benefit from 
</I>&gt;<i> enhanced performance in many cases and certainly enhanced reliability 
</I>&gt;<i> in all cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, don't lose the faith NOW (I've been whining and complaining at 
</I>&gt;<i> developers for YEARS on this now). We're finally almost, almost there 
</I>&gt;<i> (and some people are in fact there already).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be happy to document some of the rough bits for the list as we 
</I>&gt;<i> all make the switch.
