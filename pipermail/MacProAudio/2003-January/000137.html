<PRE>Thanks Vic,
Yes we need some balance between those of us who are OS X proponents 
and those who are still suffering the distance that we make them feel 
as they continue to need OS 9. It's a very seriously transitional 
yeah&#8212;&#160;especially for the audio world.

By year-end, all the pro applications will be entering their first 
stages of OS X debugging (I hope not much) and enhancing beyond 
versions one. But there will still be a lot of pros holding back.

Next year, the hardware and the software will be too profoundly 
superior for any of the pros to be able to hold back any longer. I see 
the entire pro audio world on OS X by 2005.

Is that fair to say?
