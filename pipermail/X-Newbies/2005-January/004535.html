<PRE>Miles, you gave me more things to think about.

It is installed as Administrator, so the other users should see it.  
The basic game goes in by dragging the entire folder icon from the CD 
to the hard drive.  There is no &quot;installer&quot; and there is no EULA 
statement until launching the application on the hard drive.  It copied 
to the top level of the hard drive.  Then, initially, I slid it into 
Applications.  After reading this and the other responses, I trashed 
the Zoo and re-installed it.  Leaving it at the top of the hard drive, 
I then attempted to run it from the user accounts, and got the same 
error message as before.

&gt;<i> However, it can also be the case that only one user may license the
</I>&gt;<i> program,
</I>
Ouch!  There is nothing like that in the license statement.
&gt;<i> rogue amoeba, for instance, has a program Audio Hijack which will
</I>&gt;<i> not run for the other users on the machine because the license is for a
</I>&gt;<i> single user.
</I>&gt;<i>  Don't really know what to offer in this, other than make sure that 
</I>&gt;<i> the CD
</I>&gt;<i> is in the tray when starting, as Birgit wrote, and perhaps install it 
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> the user in question with their applications directory?
</I>
I just installed Zoo again, this time in one of the user accounts.  It 
WORKS!  But I still get the license statement each time.  Will have to 
let the kids live with that.

Thing is that I had the grandkids' account set up in Simple Finder.  
That will not do now, because Simple Finder does not support installs.  
So I'll have to reset the kids' account as &quot;Managed&quot; with some 
limitations.

Thanks, everyone,

Al Poulin
