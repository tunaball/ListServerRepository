And, it seems, those few who do experience problems tend to have 
multiple items of third part hardware installed internally or attached. 
  Others may have a boatload of unusual applications.  Or they have 
messed around with the OS.  But if your equipment is pretty much 
mainstream and your software is mostly major/name brand, you are very 
unlikely to have any problems.  Also, with 10.3 Panther being very 
mature by now, all the responsible hardware and software vendors have 
already caught up with any patches required to their drivers and 
software.  So, for any add-ons and applications you have installed, 
check the vendor sites in their support pages for any updates and 
download them to be ready for installation right after your OS upgrade.

For the actual upgrade of the OS, back up your data.  Repair 
permissions using the copy of Disk Utility that is on your target hard 
drive, consider using the Archive and Install option, run the OS 10.3 
up to its latest version 10.3.7 with downloads from Apple, using the 
Combo version of the latest update.  Repair permissions again.  Then 
update your drivers and applications if appropriate.  Repair 
permissions again.

Oh, some have said that Panther can reveal deficiencies in third party 
RAM by refusing to completely install or to run as it should.  
Reputable RAM vendors routinely replace such RAM.

For routine reference, I have David Pogue's Mac OS X Panther Edition 
The Missing Manual.  This is the book that gets most mention.  Robin 
Williams also has a book that some folks in my user group like because 
it uses a lot of screen shots.

Problems?  Come back to this list.

proactive self-defense is for the rest of us.
