Lynn, 

First of all don't despair :-)

I had a not too dissimilar problem recently with a partition on a drive that
would not appear on the desktop and yet in DiskUtility I could see it and
verifying and repairing the disk gave me the re-assurance that everything
appeared to be ok. But...still no access.

The recommendation from all authorities was DiskWarrior. It is available as
an online download that you can then burn direct to CD (for near instant
use) if you don&#185;t have a copy yet. Find it here:

<A HREF="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/">http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/</A>

I was very lucky, I did not need to use DiskWarrior in the end. After 2 days
missing in action, the partition in question simply appeared on the desktop,
without any action at the time by me. One of life's little mysteries.

Hopefully yours too is just taking an extra nap for a while. Otherwise try
DiskWarrior - it seems to be the best thing for these situations if luck is
not on your side.
