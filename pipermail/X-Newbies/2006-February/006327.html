<PRE>10.4.5 is 10.4.5 and depending on whether you use Software Update or  
an installer downloaded through Apple's support site, the security  
fixes will only include any previously issued security fixes (if one  
hasn't installed those previously) plus the one listed in my last e- 
mail. The update didn't change on 2/14, Apple just got around to  
posting the specifics of the security updates included in the 10.4.5  
package. If Apple was including something more, then they would have  
made a specific announcement about a (hypothetical) 10.4.5-1 update  
(which they haven't done) or would have posted a separate security  
update to include the security fix I mentioned which has been in  
10.4.5 since it was originally posted.

Apple wouldn't post two versions of the same 10.4.5 update without  
some way of differentiating them as doing so would create all sorts  
of problems with the built-in Software Update mechanism.

Also, if you check Apple's downloads site, the only 10.4.5 updates  
for the client listed are the combo update, the delta update, and the  
intel specific update. All are dated 2/14/06. No other updates to the  
10.4.5 update are available nor is there a more recent security update.

Jane, I'm a pretty experienced Mac user dating back to 1984. I'm also  
a fairly proficient user of OS X. I really try not to make assertions  
about matters without doing my research first. I've noticed during my  
time on this list which goes back to the early days of OS X that you  
often speak first and have to backpeddle later. It would do everyone  
some good that if you want to speak with authority on a matter, that  
you at least make sure of the facts before posting.

That's not to say that people on this list shouldn't feel free to ask  
questions and even propose hypotheses for the answers to those  
questions. It's just important that those more experienced users who  
are serving as a resource to the &quot;Newbies&quot; on this list do their best  
to give factual answers to the questions raised and discern between  
certain knowledge and educated guesses.
&lt;/soapbox&gt;
