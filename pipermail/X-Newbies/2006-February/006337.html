I'm not making a federal case out of anything. Merely pointing out  
your repeated behavior of stating opinion as fact, and then backing  
out of it later.


&gt;<i> This was what I was talking about from the site:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This document describes the security content of the Mac OS X  
</I>&gt;<i> 10.4.5 update, which can be downloaded and installed via Software

</I>&gt;<i> I am not saying I absolutely am telling people this or that, I am

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have never told anyone NOT to get the fix for the virus....I'm

</I>&gt;<i>

There is as of yet, no fix for the trojan from Apple. You stated that  
the 10.4.5 update contained the fix for the virus. You stated it  
without equivocation. If you don't know you are correct, say so in  
the post, not 3 posts later. Don't act as if you are an expert when  
you know not much more, and apparently much less, than the average  
denizen of the newbies list.


&gt;<i> I thought this was a discussion list. 'Statements' will from now on  
</I>&gt;<i> have a ? after them to make sure they are understood by everyone to  
</I>&gt;<i> be something I am exploring as well as a WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? in  
</I>&gt;<i> caps. How's that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Better. A simple &quot;I think...&quot; would work. If, as you say, you are  
'exploring', or 'trying to figure out', say so in the post.

&gt;<i> &lt;sigh&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Stop whining.
