Not enough free space. 10.2 is slower than 10.3 which in turn is  
slower than 10.4

&gt;<i> Mac Storage with 43.6 GB (41.7 GB Free)

matters not

&gt;<i> Mac OS 9.2 with 6.8 GB (5.6 GB Free)

Get rid of every vestige of Norton. 'Back in the day' it was a pretty  
good product, now, in X, I think I would be safe to say that it  
causes as many issues as it fixes.

Well, yes, it could BUT...while others on the list will not doubt  
offer the 'how to' it's not generally as simple as just dragging  
things over there. X is a whole different animal that 9.

At the core of your issue are three things:

Lack of HD space for X, which you can't do a lot about very easily,  
given that X must be in a partition &lt;8 gig and it must be contained  
within the first 8 gig of the boot drive.
Old OS, which is closely tied to issue #3
Old hardware.

If AT ALL possible, upgrade to a newer machine. It'll come with newer  
OS in all likelihood and won't have the HD limitations of your  
current machine.
