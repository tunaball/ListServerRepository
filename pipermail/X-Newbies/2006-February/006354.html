<PRE>As the one who started the discussion about making sure information  
is either &quot;correct&quot; or is a guess (educated or otherwise), I think  
the back-and-forth has had value. As Steve points out with his ironic  
comment, it's silly for new users to blindly accept all advice, as  
traveling that road has significant danger. I think Jane understands  
that it is important to be a bit more clear in her communications.  
And I've learned that flame wars can certainly take on a life of  
their own!

Now let's get back to helping new users learn to use their Macs  
safely and effectively.

And on that note, there does appear to be a new security threat  
associated with Safari, where downloading a &quot;safe&quot; file that actually  
hides a certain type of shell script can lead to the shell script  
automatically running. A malicious shell script could do all sorts of  
bad things, like, say, erasing your whole user directory. I'd say  
that this is probably a fair bit worse than the Oompa Loompa worm. I  
would expect Apple to address this fairly quickly, but in the  
meantime would suggest that everyone turn off &quot;Open &quot;safe&quot; files  
after downloading&quot; option in the General Pane of Safari preferences.  
Then check the file information for the downloaded file before  
opening it. In the case of a sample exploit, the filename indicates  
that the file is a picture; however, under file preview in Column  
View in the Finder, the file is described as a Unix Executable File.  
This exploit can also occur with Mail.app, but there is not an easy  
fix for that at this point.
