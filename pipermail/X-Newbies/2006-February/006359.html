It's a matter of opinion, but I'd say Mail would be better. In Tiger,  
each message is stored as a separate file, so it would be possible to  
delete only the message in question, just from the Finder. That  
would, of course, be a last ditch effort, because it may not do Good  
things&#8482; for Mail.app's indexing. Besides - I like Mail.app better.

In both Mail.app and Entourage, you can delete a mail without opening  
by closing the Preview pane, then selecting (single click, not  
double)  the message, then delete.
