<PRE>My nephew has the B&amp;W 350 and I got a 300 but just upgraded to a G3 450 
Zif.  So I call him on the phone because in my opinion I have way to 
many wait states and beachballs for my liking and I would think that 
450Mhz would be  enough to power X 10.2.3 and I have 256 meg of ram so 
I should not be seeing all this sluggishness.

So here are the comparison B&amp;W's

His 	B&amp;W G3 350
Me	B&amp;W G3 450

His	12 gig OEM drive to moherboard
His	OS X 10.2.3 on 12 gig
Me	 6 gig OEM drive to motherboard
Me	30 gig ATA 100 drive to ATA card
Me 	SIIG ATA 133 card
Me 	OS X 10.2.3 on 30 gig

His	384 meg of ram
Me	256 meg of ram

His	Epson printer
Me	Epson Printer

His	Epson Scanner
Me	Epson Scanner

His	DSL
Me	DSL

His 	PC VGA monitor
Me	PC VGA monitor

His	CD player
Me	DVD/CD player

Well that is everything now for the question.

Why is it that his slower system takes half the time to load and get to 
the log in screen than my system does?  Why does he have less wait 
states and a much perkier application and over all GUI experience than 
I do.

I have deleted all the plist files that I thought might be culprits.

I have many many more apps than my nephew could that be a reason for my 
system being as slow as it is?

I  notice that when using the newest version of Limewire or MorpheusMac 
that everything seems to come to a grinding stop including the dock and 
application menu bars.

If someone could tell me how to fix this I would so appreciate it.

Many thanks.

Lee
