&gt;<i>I'm taking up bandwidth here because I like to try to help people who are
</I>&gt;<i>NEW [Mac OS X Newbies] to OS X. And I think you may be missing something
</I>&gt;<i>here; in order to run Classic in OS X you MUST HAVE a fully bootable OS 9
</I>&gt;<i>System Folder present.
</I>
And I do...that was not the question.

&gt;<i>The OS 9 System folder HAS TO RESIDE in the SAME
</I>&gt;<i>PARTITION as OS X. 
</I>
In order to run Classic from within X yes.

&gt;<i>The fact that you can go into Startup disk and select it
</I>&gt;<i>to start up seperately is just there because the folder EXISTS.
</I>
Yes I know that.

&gt;<i> If you have
</I>&gt;<i>another partition on your hard drive all you have to do to make it bootable
</I>&gt;<i>in OS 9 is copy the System Folder into it. Drag and Drop no muss no fuss
</I>&gt;<i>(note: This will work for the OS 9 System folder, but for OS X you need to
</I>&gt;<i>use something like CCC or Retrospect.).
</I>
OK, I wanted to keep it separate and I suppose I could try that. I know 
how to make partitions and install separately with my X and 9 disks...on 
other machines, but wanted to keep the applications that ran in X with X, 
but wonder why there is an alias to them from 9.....do I need to copy 
those into the 9 folder?

&gt;<i> The reason your newest 9.2.1
</I>&gt;<i>Universal won't work is (this is just a guess on my part, I have no way to
</I>&gt;<i>confirm it.) that the boot ROM on the new machines only contains
</I>&gt;<i>instructions to look for an OS X system file and will not recognize an OS 9
</I>&gt;<i>System Folder except when told to by the PRAM which requires you boot to X
</I>&gt;<i>set your OS selection in Startup and restart.
</I>
Yep seems that way. That is what they said.....that is how they control 
it usually, the ROM.

&gt;<i> If you want to confirm this,
</I>&gt;<i>you have NEW machines so you are entitled to Apple Phone Tech Support. Call
</I>&gt;<i>them and get the straight skinny from them.
</I> 
I didn't want to confirm it with myself, I knew it, I just wanted to 
explain it to those who doubted it on this list...and then someone 
accused me of bitching to which I smile since sorting all this out could 
seem like bitching because there was never so much to sort out as 
now.......&lt;sigh&gt;
