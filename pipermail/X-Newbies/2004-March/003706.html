That's the old definition.  More modern interpretations allow for a
single entity to possess control over a vast majority, i.e. a near
monopoly, of the masses.

:<i> If you use monopoly to describe a freely made 
</I>:<i> choice, then it becomes an essentially meaningless term.
</I>
Free choice is a meaningless term too.

</I>:<i> There are plenty of people who explicitly let someone else make the 
</I>:<i> choice for them (e.g. I let my son/niece/etc. pick my computer because

</I>
In my experience, this is the main reason why a majority of people own a
Windoze box.

:<i> But the vast majority of people pick the PC because they *want* it.
</I>
I disagree with this statement on so many levels, but mostly over the
notion of &quot;majority&quot; and &quot;want&quot;.  Think &quot;jumbo shrimp&quot;.

:<i> That's the cold reality that most Mac people 
</I>:<i> don't want to face. The typical PC user will complain about Microsoft 
</I>:<i> and mock the Mac in the same breath.
</I>
Nope, typical Windoze users mock Mac users for the reason that bullies
taunt other kids: to make themselves feel better and to hide problems in
their own lives.

:<i> Going on about Microsoft's &quot;monopoly&quot; just reinforces the denial of 
</I>:<i> self responsibility - that someone else is responsible for their crappy 
</I>:<i> computing experience.
</I>
In general, this is true.  The vast majority of people do not and cannot
adequately tailor their computing preferences to fit their needs.

:<i> Certainly, not every person can make the choice 
</I>:<i> in the work environment, but they can still pick their own computers. 
</I>
If most work environments prevent you from make a free choice, it also
has a monopoly over where you can work.  It's not a free choice if you
can't find work in another environment that supports a computer platform
that you prefer.

:<i> I've used a Mac at home, even while being the chief software architect 
</I>:<i> for a 100% PC company. So no, I don't engage in the delusion that 
</I>:<i> Microsoft has a &quot;monopoly&quot; on personal computing.
</I>
It wasn't that long ago that M$ was busy killing off Netscape.

It wasn't that long ago that M$ forced PC makers to bundle only Windoze
and no other OS.

It wasn't that long ago that M$ tried to force Apple to &quot;knife the baby&quot;.
