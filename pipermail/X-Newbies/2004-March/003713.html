There is a universe of reasons between the terms &quot;simply&quot; and &quot;don't&quot;.
And to ignore the reasons behind the choice is destroy the notion of
free choice.  One cannot be free to make a choice if one has no reason
to make that choice.

You also completely ignored three behaviors (of quite many I'm sure)
listed in my earlier post that demonstrated M$'s history of monopoly
power abuses.  M$ destroys reasonable alternatives to Windoze so that
all that remains are Windoze products or no product at all.

:<i> The PC user's reasoning may be suspect - like, &quot;I bought a PC because
</I>:<i> I don't want my friends to make fun of me&quot;, but whose fault is that?
</I>
If M$ makes it sound uncool and unfashionable to own anything other than
Windoze products, then M$ does share most of the fault.  When this kind
of fashion statement gets tranformed into IT/IS/management mindshare and
thus the choice of platforms has an effect on job security, then M$ is
absolutely at fault.  FUD kills free choice.
