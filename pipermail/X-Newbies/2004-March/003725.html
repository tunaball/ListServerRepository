I think Mac OS X is a great choice for many reasons.  However, I believe
that Steven Rogers' point is that under certain circumstances Windoze is
also a reasonable choice and that Windoze users make this choice freely.
While I think Steven's point is valid, my own experiences tell me that
his point is valid only for a small minority of Windoze users.

</I>
Nah, I prefer the view that OS X is really a new platform from Apple,
one that has attracted traditional Mac users, traditional Windoze users,
lots of Unix users, and not a few new computer users.  The result of
this diversity is that OS X users have widely different opinions on the
most seemingly basic topics.  Getting someone to dive into an OS X forum
just to cause havoc is as unlikely as getting Windoze virus writers to
write OS X viruses.
