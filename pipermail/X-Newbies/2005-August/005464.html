</I>
First, I forgot to mention I'm on digest, so if you've been wondering 
where I've been, I just received the latest digest.

Thanks, Steven, for the pithy and reassuring answer.

After posting I went back and observed more carefully, and realized 
that my memory of the occurrences had been flawed (imagine that;-).

It isn't the whole window, it's the contents. For example, in Mail, if 
I'm just in a mailbox, viewing one of the messages, it's the message 
(not the list of messages or the window). In the finder, which I view 
by columns, it's the contents of the column furthest to the right. In 
Explorer, it's just the window's contents. In this [Mail] composition 
window, it's the message contents, not the header.

And it seems it does sometimes occur in the background windows, too.

It occurs intermittently, which originally led me to the &quot;service 
attacks&quot; assumption. The &quot;jump&quot; is about one line of text.

I had posted the same question to the MacWizards list and one of the 
Wizards made a suggestion that sounds right, but I haven't followed up 
on it yet: He suggested it might be the scroll wheel on my mouse, (even 
though he had no way of knowing I had a two-button mouse with a scroll 
wheel...) The jumping is similar to the movement produced by the mouse 
(a Kensington &quot;Mouse in a Box&quot;).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the router, most of the pages about that box are in
</I>&gt;<i> Japanese, so that makes it difficult to figure out what the options
</I>&gt;<i> are. I doubt that there is no firewall for it, but figuring it out
</I>&gt;<i> could be tricky. Probably much easier to buy a cheap little router
</I>&gt;<i> box with a firewall than figure out how to retrofit the Buffalo.
</I>
You're probably right. I'll go back to the web page and see how complex 
it looks.
Somebody has pointed out that the firewall built into OS X is probably 
all that's necessary anyway.

Yes. Actually, the window's content, as I clarified above.

Thanks,
Rodney
