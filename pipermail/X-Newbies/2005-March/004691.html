&gt;<i>I would like to hear
</I>&gt;<i>some views on OS X and the Darwin/BSD undercarriage. Is OS X as
</I>&gt;<i>unstable as some people make it out to be? 
</I>
Normally it is as stable as a rock.  I haven't had a system crash in the 
last 4 years.  I've only had a handful of application crashes, which I 
dealt with by simply re-launching the application and continuing on with 
my work.

You can surf the Web for hours on end and never have a crash due to 
memory management problems.  (Doing this was guaranteed to cause a crash 
under OS 8/9.)

&gt;<i>Programs can't be killed
</I>&gt;<i>cleanly, etc? 
</I>
They can be killed (when necessary) as cleanly as you could want.  Go to 
the Apple menu and choose Force Quit.

&gt;<i>I saw a demo G5 at a shop here in Jakarta where the tech
</I>&gt;<i>guy in trying to find the terminal app crashed 4 programs running and
</I>&gt;<i>couldn't kill them seperately, but had to reeboot 2 times!!!
</I>
If you don't know what you are doing, I strongly advice staying entirely 
away from the Terminal.  In fact, I've found that there is just about 
nothing that you can't do from the graphic user interface.
