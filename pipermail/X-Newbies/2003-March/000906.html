&gt;&gt;<i>OK fair enough...now here's a question for you:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I recently dumped a lot of my pref files. I just went over to the X 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>machine and found that something had again &quot;taken&quot; it over.
</I>
&gt;<i>Would you define for me what you mean by &quot;taken it over.&quot; 
</I>
I could not get anything to work, the spinning ball, etc....like &quot;stuck&quot; 
but not quite frozen, as if some process was running in the background.

&gt;<i>I don't 
</I>&gt;<i>understand what you are intending by that. Do you mean that the machine 
</I>&gt;<i>will not respond? Doesn't behave like it did a moment ago? A restart or 
</I>&gt;<i>two ago?
</I>
I had to restart it. But it wasn't like that when I left it.... 
 
&gt;<i> &gt;I made sure 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that automatic QT and Software updates are turned OFF. Is there a central 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>location from which to turn off INDEXING?
</I>
&gt;<i>Was Sherlock trying to Index everything? Or are you talking about some 
</I>&gt;<i>other function? Is this INDEXING related to &quot;Taken it over,&quot;?
</I>
Sherlock is the internet. It does not index files on your drive that I 
know of. In any case I am not connected to the internet on that machine...

Indexing is turned on by going into each GET INFO window or where else 
have you? That was my question -- how to make sure it's not running 
automatically. By &quot;taken over&quot; I meant it would not respond in a 
reasonable time yet was not actually frozen completely. In other words, 
it was not allowing &quot;multi-tasking&quot; (just like it does not do &quot;kernel 
protection&quot; when TE crashes)
