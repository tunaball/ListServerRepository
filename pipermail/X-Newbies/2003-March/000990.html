Synchronicity. So did I. Got onto my train, flipped her open and...

I'd used DAVE. Same difference.

Likewise. Cost me six minutes plus the time I spent hoping it'd just 
timeout _before_ doing the restart. Plus the time to get the apps 
back up just as I needed them.

&gt;<i>

Amen. And the really sad part is that a similar flaw existed even 
with connection to TCP/IP under OS 9.

&gt;<i>Second, seeing that we are stuck with this until at least OS 10.2.4, does
</I>&gt;<i>anyone know of a reliable way to manually tell this thing to give up on a
</I>&gt;<i>disconnected Samba server?  One thing that definitely does not work is to

</I>&gt;<i>disconnected Samba server seems to increase the panic.
</I>
None of which I'm aware. I really wish that there was a panic button 
which would present aan opportunity to do drastic things that one 
might absolutely want to happen, no matter how inadvisable. 
CMD-OPT-ESC does it for running applications. Perhaps it could have a 
tabbed interface and have a tab for shares, another for print jobs, 
another for copy/moves. Just allow me to make it go away, interrupt 
everything when I say so, and let me tell you what to do. Dammit &lt;g&gt;.

Speaking of which, that was my 2nd restart in one day - I opened a 
folder containing notes and tips, mistakenly CMD-a, selecting all, 
then dragged to the desktop. I really omly intended to drag one item 
onto DevonThink in the Dock but alas. One thousand, eight hundred and 
eighty-one items onto the desktop! It took 55 minutes before I could 
get things back to normal. But that's a story for another day...
