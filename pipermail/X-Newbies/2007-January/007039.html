</I>&gt;<i> are full of reports of this happening. My machine worked fine for
</I>&gt;<i> about eight months, then all of a sudden it wouldn't read CDs. Then
</I>&gt;<i> it wouldn't read DVDs. Then it wouldn't burn anything. It had the
</I>&gt;<i> same clicking sound as the reader above.
</I>&gt;<i> I took my machine in and, after having it shipped to Apple, had it

</I>&gt;<i> I also can't mount the iLife '05 DVD in my PowerBook G4 (15&quot; 1.5 GHz,
</I>&gt;<i> Jul 2004, Matsushita UJ-825 SuperDrive). The DVD will mount just fine
</I>&gt;<i> on my 3rd Gen iMac G4 1 GHz (Sony SuperDrive). I even copied the DVD
</I>&gt;<i> on the iMac and the copy would not mount on the PowerBook! The disk
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't spit out, it just spins a while and then stops spinning.
</I>&gt;<i> A while back a friend gave me some pictures on a CD and didn't finish
</I>&gt;<i> the session (I do not know what PC software she used). The unfinished
</I>&gt;<i> CD wouldn't mount on the PowerBook but would mount just fine on my
</I>&gt;<i> iMac. I'm wondering if Apple finished the session properly on these
</I>&gt;<i> iLive '05 DVD's? As for my drive going bad, I just don't think that's
</I>&gt;<i> it, or the copy would've worked? It seems like it has to do with the
</I>&gt;<i> formatting of the DVD. I guess I'll have to call Apple.
</I>
Hmmm something to watch out for in the future. In my case, I tried
zapping the PRAM (4x) and now finally, I have the iLife programs
installed again on my G5.

Cheers,

Brian
