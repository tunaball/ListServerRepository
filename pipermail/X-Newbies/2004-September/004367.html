There is really no other practical way to address his need.

I don't know of any Mac anti-virus programs that scans for *all* Windows 
viruses, rather than just selected Windows viruses.  Maybe Sophos does, 
their pre-sales information is unclear (they say that they handle viruses 
that are &quot;considered to be a threat,&quot; which doesn't sound like they 
handle *all* viruses), but none of the others do (at least according to 
their employees, who I have spoken with about this.)

IS personnel who prefer Windows are probably always going to be biggots 
who scapegoat the Macintosh.  That doesn't change the fact that Windows 
viruses aren't a Mac problem, they are a Windows problem.  Macs don't 
actively (or even passively, usually) spread Windows viruses, so Mac 
anti-viral software doesn't look for all of them.  The threat from a 
Macintosh spreading a Windows virus is almost insignificant.

Windows viruses are a Windows problem.  An IS manager who does not have a 
good Windows anti-virus program, meticulously updated, on every Windows 
machine in his shop, is either grossly negligent or incompetent.  If a 
Windows machine suffers at the hands of a virus, it is invariably the IS 
person's fault for not protecting his Windows machines adequately, not 
due to any threat from Mac's.
