Unix was originally designed in 1969 by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs 
(according to legend, so he could play games on a DEC PDP-7 
minicomputer). It was highly successful and it was eventually adopted 
by many manufacturers, who distributed and supported their own variants 
or version, to the extent that nowadays the term &quot;Unix&quot; (originally 
spelled &quot;UNIX&quot;) means a family of related operating systems, rather 
than any specific one. (Apple had its own version, the late unlamented 
A/UX.) Mac OS X is based on a member of this family, the BSD version of 
Unix, developed at UC Berkeley.

Linux (a contraction of &quot;Linus Unix&quot;) was originated by an engineer 
from Finland, Linus Torvalds, who re-wrote a Unix kernel (i.e., basic 
elements of the operating system) without using any proprietary code, 
thus creating a version which was free from any corporate restrictions.

So both BSD (on which the Mac OS X is based) and Linux are Unices (some 
prefer &quot;Unixen&quot;), i.e., flavours of Unix. Therefore, in geekspeak, you 
should have replied, &quot;Mac OS X is built on BSD, not Linux&quot;.

And, to be pedantic about it, officially there never was such a beast 
as &quot;Macintosh OS&quot;. Apple applied the name &quot;Macintosh&quot; both to the 
computer and to the operating system. Eventually, the powers-that-be in 
Cupertino decided that was too confusing, and, sometimes in the '90s (I 
can't recall when), officially baptized the operating system &quot;Mac OS&quot; 
(not &quot;Macintosh OS&quot;).
