Yes

There's no reason why the Belkin shouldn't be able to do what you 
need though unless its wireless component is substandard or the 
distance between the router location and the desired signal is 
outside of its spec. In which case it is practical to have the router 
at one desired or mandated location, and a separate WAP at a more 
location that is more practical as the origin of the wireless 
network. Bear in mind that you should also be able to disrefard the 
other features of the Belkin and just use it s WAP functionality. 
You's do this by turning off its ability to give out IP addresses 
(DHCP server off) and plug the patch cable into its &quot;LAN&quot; side, if it 
has a multi-port switch capability. I'm generalising as I have no 
specific experience with the Belkin product.

I'd at least test the range with it turned off. Not necessarily with 
the intent to leave it unprotected in normal operation, but to get a 
feel for how much the range is compromised by the security. If it is 
compromising your range in an unacceptable way then you might have to 
start comparing that specification for different WAPs. Or consider 
different ways of extending range - antennae, location, higher-rated 
equipment, etc.
