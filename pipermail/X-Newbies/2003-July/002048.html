Well, there is no Outlook Express for X, is there an Outlook? I would not 
be using that unless forced to use an Exchange server (yuck) and I have 
no Office on there since AW seems to handle all that now.

Here is a response I just sent to Andy:

Yes Andy, we are going back and forth about this, and my cousin swears 
it's not her, however, the other night I called and she was indeed ON the 
computer at that time I got the mail and her BROTHER, the only other 
likely suspect, was NOT......so, I guess she will just have to face up to 
it that it's her!
I HAVE gotten mail from her brother's &quot;address&quot; but the information 
attached even had her name in it with her financial information and stuff 
about where she'd surfed so I knew it was her. (NEA Teacher benefits, 
Fidelity Investments, Morningstar Trading, Baby stores as she is a new 
grandma, etc.....all stuff that had her name on it even though appearing 
to be sent by her brother's computer -------- she was horrified! LOL)

Of course, being on a Mac, she was amazed at how I knew all this stuff.. 
&lt;veg&gt;
It's kinda funny.....not really but you know what I mean. :-)
