OS X is vastly better in terms of making one's computer usable, and in 
terms of Apple's viability as a company. It is not really an issue of 
trade-offs between OS X and OS 9, so much as whether individuals are in 
a position to take advantage of the benefits of OS X.  OS 9 is an 80's 
operating system - a brilliant innovation that was very long in the 
tooth.

Raising a silly pseudo-issue like this to the level of a comparison 
between OS X and OS 9 just shows that while some people are torn 
between real migration issues, others are simply stuck in the past and 
resenting change itself.

And even if one were to set the facts aside and entertain the merits of 
OS 9, the point still stands that OS 9 is a dead horse. At some point, 
it becomes only an issue of nostalgia along with the merits of the 
Amiga, Osborne, Lisa, etc. If there are constructive criticisms to be 
made about OS X, they have to stand on their own rather than coming 
from a comparison between OS 9 and OS X.
