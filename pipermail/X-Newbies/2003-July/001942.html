Indeed, you missed it. Since I was referring to material you quoted, my 
remark concerned the author of that material, not you. I clearly 
indicated that by double quotes. They indicated that my comments were 
about material quoted, not written, by you.

&gt;<i> Please revisit the links. The background for the idea that the 
</I>&gt;<i> impetus/inspiration was Minix is in Linus' notes and postings during 
</I>&gt;<i> the 0.x phase of Linux' formulation.
</I>
Impetus or inspiration is one thing. The origin of the name is another. 
The very material you quote says:

&gt;&gt;<i> [...] I'd like any feedback on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [...]
</I>
It's perfectly natural for Linux to resemble Minix &quot;somewhat&quot; -- both 
are more or less based on Unix. Linux made its first inroads among 
users of Minix for good reasons: both systems originated in academia, 
were designed to run on cheap machines, and provided the source code. 
Eventually, a controversy developed within the Minix community on the 
relative merits of the two operating systems. According to one legend, 
the impetus to develop Linux came to Torvalds during a lecture at the 
University of Helsinki in which a professor was unable to get a Minix 
machine going; the professor disparaged the 'brain-dead' design of 
Minix and exclaimed that someone should write an OS just to show that 
'weenie from Amsterdam' how things should really be done. The 
counter-legend claims that Torvalds actually only re-wrote parts of 
Minix to improve it; to claim that &quot;Linux&quot; stands for &quot;Linus' Minix&quot; is 
really to take this view.

Minix's author, Dr Tanenbaum, clearly distinguishes between Minix and 
Linux (from a debate in early 1992 on the comp.os.minix newsgroup, 
widely available on the 'net):

&gt;<i> MINIX is a microkernel-based system. [...] LINUX is a monolithic style 
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>
And Torvalds' feelings are made clear in the same forum:

&gt;<i> [...] your job is being a professor and researcher: That's one hell of 
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> good excuse for some of the brain-damages of minix. I can only hope 
</I>&gt;<i> (and
</I>&gt;<i> assume) that Amoeba doesn't suck like minix does. [...]
</I>
So much for Linux meaning &quot;Linus' Minix&quot;.

At any rate, this is clearly irrelevant to most subscribers to this 
list, and I don't intend to carry it any further.
