<PRE>Anne:

This e-list dropped me about a week ago and I had problems getting back on.
I do not know exactly where you are in this thread.  But I'll try to address
your questions in general.

What I missed here with the stoppage in X Newbies Digests is the connection
between updating to 10.2.8 and clean install.  I do not know whether clean
install here refers to 10.2.8 or a version upgrade, like Panther.

</I>
Clean install is now shorthand for what Apple calls &quot;Archive &amp; Install.&quot;
When you take that option, all the things you mentioned are left untouched.
Your Home folder is untouched.  Archive &amp; Install of a version of OS X seems
to be the best and safest choice for most people.  The other install options
have caused problems.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do any of the manuals have a comprehensive list on what to do. I need
</I>&gt;<i> Step-by-Step.
</I>
Go by the .pdf file (what used to be called &quot;Read Me&quot;) that comes with the
software.  Also, brouse through Apple's Support pages for software topics
related to what you want to do.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I'm on dialup and have had no success getting uncorrupted files.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any other
</I>&gt;<i> way? (Other than letting my brother d/l on Windows and mailing me a CD).
</I>
If that worked before, why not?  If it did not work, someone here may be
glad to collect downloads from Apple, burn a CD, and send it to you.  I
could do that.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In light of the security update, maybe I have to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could I choose to just update? Will I lose anything if I do it? As I
</I>&gt;<i> recall, going from
</I>&gt;<i> OS 10.1 to 10.2 was pretty effortless, but then I didn't do a clean
</I>&gt;<i> install there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also don't want to eliminate my scanner, which I notice has no OSX
</I>&gt;<i> driver, the lastest
</I>&gt;<i> one they have is for 9. I use it through Classic.
</I>
Your classic things are not affected.

Good Luck,
