<PRE>Wow that's brutal, glad I haven't run into that.

How are you connected to the Epson? Ethernet? USB

I don't think this is the fix, but worth a try - I saw something mentioned
in the log about timing.. if you are running the connection through a
hub/network - try plugging the printer directly to your machine.

I used to work on the same machine - printed often to an older big format
Epson through Ethernet.. Hooking up directly to the machine solved nearly
every problem I had with that device (meaning I had a bad connection in the
network somewhere).

Murphy's Law dictates that any print job needed within x amount of time will
require at least 2 times that to complete.  ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> fine. I do have a problem each time I go to print to the epson. It says
</I>&gt;<i> there is a communications error and I have to go to the print monitor,
</I>&gt;<i> stop the job and restart the job. Then it prints fine. I have to do
</I>&gt;<i> this each time I print. I haven't had time to chase that problem down
