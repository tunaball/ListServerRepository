</I> Do NOT delete parts of the OS to make it go faster. That was something that
worked on earlier versions. However, that is no longer the case. There are
other things that you can do, though. For one thing, go over macosxhints.com
they had a list of how to tweak things so that less of the processor is tied
up dealing with Aqua. Things like dealing with antialiasing and whatnot.
  I have had my system folder on an external drive before, but didn't seem
to notice anything faster. If anything I think that it was a little slower.
  Has your machine been able to run the cron clean up tasks that are set to
work at 0315? I have seen others make the observation that their machine was
noticeably slower when the maintenance scripts weren't able to run. I think
that I would try that first. Miles
