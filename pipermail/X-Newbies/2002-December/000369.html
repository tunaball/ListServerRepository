<PRE>I'm using Photoshop 7.0 on a sawtooth G4 (400mhz agp) with 10.2.2 and 
704mb of ram.
Today I had just printed a 45mb file to my Epson 2000P. When I returned 
to the machine, the print was just finishing, and Photoshop had closed 
down. When it doest this, I'm usually not at the machine when this 
happens and there is no dialog box saying PS has crashed and that other 
apps are not affected. I do get seemingly random crashes of other apps. 
Explorer last night, for example. I haven't been able to reproduce any 
of these crashes.
Do I need to reinstall X? or Photoshop? I have X on a spacious new 
120gig drive. I installed it fresh a couple of months ago, though I 
would have used CCC if I'd known about it then.
I looked at the Adobe Photoshop 7.0crash.log in the CrashReporter 
folder and found the information below. There are similar entries for 
other crashes all with the same exception: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (0x0001).

What does this mean and what should I do about it?

Hmmm, I've just had a look at the console log and it talks about an 
error while printing! This happened while I was printing a 13x19 sheet 
in the printer. Aside from being a bit off color, the print worked 
fine. I do have a problem each time I go to print to the epson. It says 
there is a communications error and I have to go to the print monitor, 
stop the job and restart the job. Then it prints fine. I have to do 
this each time I print. I haven't had time to chase that problem down 
yet. I've just been happy it prints. Any Ideas? Reinstall the printer 
driver?


Thanks in advance.
