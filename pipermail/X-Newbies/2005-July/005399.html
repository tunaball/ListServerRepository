If you're just running programs and not reading mail in Windows, then  
the virus issue isn't as drastic as it is for the regular Windows user.

You have to do everything to it that you have to do with regular  
Windows, because it IS windows.

&gt;<i> Is the VPC 'stable', does it need rebooting etc at any different

It has the same kind of crash characteristics as Windows. Perhaps  
slightly less crashy than a real PC, because the low level emulation  
is more consistent than a real PC.

I was very satisfied with the functioning of VPC, but I ditched it  
after 5 because the upgrades were coming too fast, and at too much  
cost. Its slowed down now, but I could have easily bought a PC for  
what I paid for Version 3, 4, and 5. PCs are so cheap now, that I  
wouldn't recommend going with VPC unless you just don't have the desk  
space for a real one. Even laptops are down in the $600 range, which  
is pretty amazing, and a good way to get PC capabilities on the side  
without killing a ton of space.
