Archive install does not remove prefs. Applications which are  
installed in /Applications (and not installed as part of OS X) are  
retained. Items that these apps may have installed in /Library are  
not retained. If you archive install, you'll have to reinstall  
Stuffit, either move a file or reinstall Photoshop, and possibly  
reconfigure or reinstall other apps, depending on where they put things.
An Archive install is similar to OS 9's &quot;clean install&quot;. It moves  
your existing system to &quot;Previous Systems&quot; and installs anew. If you  
check the 'preserve user and network settings', it doesn't move your  
home folder. I highly recommend checking this box if you do do an  
archive install.

Haxies may or may not be removed, inactivated, or cause issues. It  
depends on how they do their magic, how well behaved they are, and  
where they are installed.

I would not yet recommend an erase &amp; install as we don't have enough  
information to go on. What exactly do you mean by &quot;have restored&quot;?  
What are the peculiarities to which you refer? If there was disk  
damage, what does Disk Utility's first aid report now?
