It appears that part of your issue is that you don't understand the  
difference between a mail server or service such as Apple's .Mac or  
SBC/Yahoo and a mail client such as Apple's &quot;Mail&quot; application. So  
let's see if we can clear that up.

Mail being sent to you ends up at a mail server such as Apple's .Mac  
or your ISP's - SBC/Yahoo in your case. To read your mail you start a  
client, an application local to your computer such as Apple's &quot;Mail&quot;  
or Eudora, it connects to the servers you've told it about, and your  
mail is downloaded to your machine and may or may not be left on the  
server - depending on the features of the server and your client's  
settings.

Sending mail works in the opposite direction. You compose the message  
in your client, which then connects to your service provider's  
server, and that server then sends your message to the appropriate  
place.

SBC/Yahoo doesn't have a mail &quot;program&quot; that I know of. They provide  
a mail service/server that you can access either via a web page or  
the email client of your choice. Are you currently accessing your SBC  
email via a web page and not aware that you can get to it from  
whatever client you might want to use?

For me or Charles or someone else to help you we need to know how  
you're currently accessing your SBC email. Once we know that we can  
advise you as to the pros/cons of storing mail in your local client  
or a server, how to move mail from one server to another (which may  
or may not be easy depending on the destination), and how to have new  
mail coming into one server be automatically forwarded to another  
either directly by the receiving server or possibly by your mail client.

As I asked above, I suspect that you're currently accessing your SBC  
mail via their web page and that if you switch to using a mail  
client, such as Apple's &quot;Mail&quot;, your complaints about &quot;not having the  
full experience&quot; will go away since their mail service is basically  
like any other mail service.

If none of this is making any sense feel free to contact me directly  
and we can arrange to talk via telephone or something like Skype or  
iChat.

Phil
