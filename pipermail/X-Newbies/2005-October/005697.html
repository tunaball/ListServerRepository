<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Tony Johansen &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-newbies.html">tjoh7019 at bigpond.net.au</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> The only info she provides is confusing. She said she had a file  
</I>&gt;<i> she had
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded from the internet which she was trying to 'save to Word'
</I>&gt;<i> apparently wanting to find it among the documents she actually  
</I>&gt;<i> creates in
</I>&gt;<i> Word in future.
</I>
Yeah, I can understand what she means: she meant &quot;I opened it in Word  
in order to have it automatically save back to the RIGHT PLACE  
[meaning where I keep all my own Word documents] so I don't lose  
track of it.&quot;

I might suggest to you that both you and your wife would find this  
sort of situation easier to deal with if she had a bit more  
understanding/training on the basic concepts behind OS X. I'm not  
talking about anything near a Computer Science degree, just a few of  
the most common concepts explained in clear language. There are a  
number of good books on the subject, but for her I might suggest &quot;OS  
X for Dummies&quot; by David Pogue. If nothing else, he's an entertaining  
writer (for a computer-book guru).

&gt;<i> One solution occurs to me: Would anything prevent me from simply  
</I>&gt;<i> creating a
</I>&gt;<i> new account for her, dragging her documents that will open over to  
</I>&gt;<i> the new
</I>&gt;<i> account then just deleting that current account?
</I>
Yes. Permissions. That idea is a nightmare that IS theoretically  
possible, but a big pain to actually accomplish. Don't bother.

&gt;<i> Would Word simply start
</I>&gt;<i> with a fresh Word Settings folder?
</I>
Why not simply delete the troublesome Word Settings folder (or put it  
in the trash but not empty the trash) and force Word to create a new  
one? That should solve the problem.

Cheers

Claiming that the Macintosh is inferior to Windows because most  
people use Windows is like saying that all other restaurants are  
inferior to McDonald's.
