<PRE>

I recently purchased a new iMac, running Tiger, and need some advice 
regarding my Netscape files. I hope there is someone on the list who 
uses Netscape (sometimes I feel like I am the only one left in the 
universe!) who might be able to help me.

I am moving from an old iMac (circa 2002, on which I could switch 
between OS 9 and OS X). I mostly used OS 9 because that is what I was 
comfortable with, but now that most of my clients are moving on, I am 
going to do the same. My browser and e-mail program of choice has been 
Netscape (again, because it is what I am comfortable using, and have 
been for years), and I have downloaded a version of Netscape (7.2) that 
works on Tiger. I have been using the browser, and it looks very similar 
to what I was using in OS 9, and feels stable, so I want to move my 
e-mail onto the new computer so I can finally stop using the old one, 
except when it is needed for something OS 9 vintage.

The salesman who helped with my iMac purchase told me I could transfer 
the files from one computer to the other one using a Firewire cable, 
which I have purchased. He didn't give me much in the way of 
instructions, but said something about bringing up the new system, 
holding down the &quot;t&quot; key, and that my hard drive from the old computer 
would appear on the desktop of the new one. I think I can handle that, 
but I have no idea where the destination should be for the old mail 
files on the new computer. In the OS 9 version, all of the mail files 
appeared in the Preferences folder, but as far as I can tell, there is 
no such folder in Tiger. Also, if it is possible to move the files, will 
I still need to set up the mail accounts in the new Netscape or will 
they be set up by moving the files alone?

Thanks for any help anyone might be able to provide.

Best regards,
Linda
