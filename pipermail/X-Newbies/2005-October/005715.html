</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas?
</I>

I have tried trashing the Word settings folder as I discovered that trying
to open that also produces the spinning ball, but that did not help anyway,
Tried restarting the machine, and tried pulling my hair out, but all seem to
be equally ineffective.

Unfortunately I never use Word so am totally unfamiliar with the program and
have no idea how to help her further. The problem is totally in her account.
