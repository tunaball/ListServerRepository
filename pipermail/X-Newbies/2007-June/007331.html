</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [X-Newbies] Printers for OS 9/USB?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there such an animal left to buy as many of my people don't still
</I>&gt;<i> want to go with X because they would have to buy a whole new computer
</I>&gt;<i> yet their printers are dying....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes I have suggested they just get a new computer but that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> always fly with the older set.

Mac OS X has been out for almost SEVEN years now.

There is ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE for not having made the transition by  
now. Including budget -- a used Mac capable of running OS X might set  
you back as little as $50. Any Mac that has at least a G3, firewire  
ports and (I would suggest a minimum of) 512MB of RAM can run Tiger.  
That takes you back to 2001, and apparently from then till now is how  
long you can have your head buried up ... I mean in the sand.

You should have been firmer with these folks a LONG time ago, and now  
it's come back to bite them.

I empathise with the resistance to change in older clients, but just  
as with cars, television and government, change is an ESSENTIAL part  
of the process and you CAN'T ignore it without consequences. The long  
lead time of Classic was intended to foster a GENTLE transition, but  
even THAT ended almost three years ago, and nobody who's made the  
transition has really missed it much!

I believe there are a SMALL handful of Epson, HP and Lexmark printers  
that still offer OS 9 drivers. You'll need to cross-check the product  
pages of each's current offerings and see. In the meantime, I would  
**strongly** suggest you get these folks who's machines qualify or  
who are near/in the market for a new machine moved over to OS X **NOW**.

Cheers
Chas
