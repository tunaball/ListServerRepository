That's all probably true.

On the other hand, it won't &quot;Play havoc&quot; with your directory, it  
won't cause runaway corruption, and in fact...it won't cause any sort  
of problem at all.

The Mac OS is still the Mac OS, and users aren't *forced* to organize  
their files the way that Apple dictates.  (There was rampant fear  
about this when OS X was first released, and it was quickly dismissed  
as untrue.  I'm surprised that this baseless FUD has reappeared now.)

I have an old blue G3 sitting here that has been running OS X since  
OS X was first commercially available.  (Over five years.) It has  
never seen Disk Warrior.  IIt has multiple folders at the root level  
of the drive, each full of a whole bunch of applications and  
utilities, organized so that I know what applications I've reviewed,  
and when.  Every one of those applications has worked just as it was  
intended to, and the computer has been dead stable for as long as it  
has run OS X.

Once again, I don't think that this discussion is appropriate for a  
&quot;newbies&quot; list.  I don't think that we should be scaring the newbies  
with this.  If you want to continue it, I suggest that we move it  
over to the X4U list.
