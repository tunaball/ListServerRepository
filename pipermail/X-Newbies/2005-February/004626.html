<PRE>Daniel,
I don't know if I've been able to find anything that is &quot;the reason&quot;, 
same as you, I'm just pleased it worked. Things I thought were causing 
it but were not:

1) I had DNS servers listed as suggested when the Safari timing out 
issues were occurring before upgrading to 10.3.7, I had removed them 
and rebooted but no change, but maybe it took effect by stopping 
services and restarting?
2) I had fast user switching on, at some point it seems like it was a 
problem, and I turned it off and rebooted - no change.
3) I had a helvetica font I suspected and trashed, I ran all the ONYX 
defaults from their automatic tab, I ran a command line check for 
damaged .plist files and deleted what I found. Also trashed .plists 
that were modified during start up.

The whole time my account was slow the other account on the same 
machine never had the problem.

</I>&gt;<i> One of the similarities in our systems is that we share a connection
