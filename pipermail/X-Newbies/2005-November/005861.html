<PRE>Hi Chas,
Thanks, but the situation is getting WORSE by the minute. I am wrting 
from my son's computer, since mine is freezing every 5-20 minutes.

1. I rebuilt the mail boxes and that  did not help the problem.
2. Then before running Disk Utility i thought I was going to back up 
some files, so I  started to use my external Jaz drive (with a 
SCSI/USB2 connection).  it seemed not to work, could not copy on the 
disks. (when it was working fine last week).
3. So then I proceeded to do the automatic Update software hoping that  
was going to do the trick.
4. To finish, I was asked to to do the Firmware 5.1.8f7 (press the 
button to start until i hear a loud noise).  Which I did and I was told 
to restart.
5. my son got on the internet on my computer and was playing a game 
online (from newgrounds.com), the computer froze...

Since then, it restarted but kept freezing over and over, i actually 
have to shut it down  maunually with the button, I can't even do 
restart from the menu or do a &quot;force Quit&quot;.

6. So I repaired Pernission from &quot;Disk Utility&quot;, that did not do 
anything (freezing kept on going), so i thought I was going to do it 
 from the install CD, so I restarted holding the &quot;C&quot; but I could not 
find the &quot;Disk Utility&quot; on the CD, I was only given the option to 
reinstall OSX , i agreed and it froze again at half way.

NOW, The message I get when it freezes is VERY SCARY: a Black box with 
white text in 4 languages telling me: &quot;you have to restart your 
computer. Hold down the power button for several seconds or press 
restart button.&quot;

Well, Doctor, What do you think?  I haven't backed up in a week.  An my 
computer freezes what even i do 9that I am on the internet or not).

Thank you I am TOTALLY FREAKED OUT!!!
Carole

Subject: [X-Newbies] Re: Corrupt mail application?

  &gt; From: Carole Wessel &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-newbies.html">carwesg at aol.com</A>&gt;
 &gt; I am running Mail 1.3.11 on my G5 10.3.9
 &gt;
 &gt; Dear team, I hope you can help me
 &gt;
 &gt; In the last few days the mail application seems to be corrupted:
 &gt; - Either it looks for ever for mail (grey circle turns and turns)
 &gt; eventually stops and then I can't read half of them.
  &gt; - Or, the one I have just read disappear from my in-box, and then 
the
 &gt; grey circle turns and turns...
 &gt; - If the computer goes to sleep, same thing, and the mails that I've
 &gt; read come back with the blue mark for unread, or the deleted ones
 &gt; reappear.
 &gt; - Then, sometimes I have the beach ball for ever and I have to force
 &gt; quit
 &gt; To go faster I have to go to my 2 accounts directly through the web
 &gt; (Verizon &amp; AOL).
 &gt;
 &gt; What should I do?

  Sounds like a troubled inbox. Before you reinstall the app (which 
might not do any good), here's a couple of tricks to try:

 (the following is taken directly from Mail's help file)
 &gt; Messages are missing, incomplete, or garbled
 &gt; Rebuild your mailbox. Choose Mailbox &gt; Rebuild.
  &gt; For POP accounts, the table of contents file (which you don't see) &gt; 
is moved aside and rebuilt, using data in the mbox file and &gt; elements 
of the old table of contents file.
 &gt;
  &gt; For IMAP accounts, the table of contents file is moved aside, and &gt; 
locally cached messages are also discarded. All the messages are &gt; 
retrieved again from the server to your hard disk and the table of &gt; 
contents file is rebuilt from the newly downloaded messages and &gt; from 
data in the old table of contents file.
 &gt;
  &gt; Since your mailboxes are stored on your hard disk, make sure you &gt; 
have enough free space on your hard disk.

  &gt; This might be a symptom of a larger problem. Run Disk Utility, &gt; 
located in Applications/Utilities (or click the link below) and &gt; 
verify and repair the disk if necessary.

  Give that a shot and see if it helps. DO NOT delete the preferences 
file (a common solution for most apps, but in Mail there is vital info 
in there). If it doesn't solve the problem, let us know and we'll 
proceed from there.
