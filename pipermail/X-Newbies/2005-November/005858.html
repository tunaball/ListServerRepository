Agreed. I've ordered an acquaintance of mine whose PC I keep running  
to put &quot;dust the computer&quot; every 3 months into her Palm calendar with  
an alarm. I'm not sure how she gets so much dust into it, but the  
last time I opened it the heat sink was literally clogged with dust.

Without getting into a detailed discussion of device I/O and how an  
OS should handle memory exhaustion, whether it's Mail, Safari, or a  
P2P program a user land program can't cause a kernel panic. It takes  
bad hardware or buggy privileged code to do this. I took a closer  
look at the stack trace and Brian ran into a bug in the NVidia  
graphics driver and the fact that a couple of P2P programs where  
running at the time is just a coincidence.
