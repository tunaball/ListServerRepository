<PRE>Carter I'm not a newbie.

I'm simpl trying to determine definitively that it was Comcast who  
did this, which I suspected from the start, even though they are  
denying it.

I had already said that:

In order to install a virus I would have had to download something -  
and I did not.
I did not change the settings myself.
There is no one else in the house.
There was no 'technician' who configured the router I doesn't exist.
There is no one who used my computer.
It wasn't used anywhere else when the 'change' happened.

So, I have been saying all along that it was Comcast... I used to be  
the one that fixed all the settings after they screwed them up on  
people's Macs for years.

I'm just trying to determine that it was them so I can complain to  
them with authority...

For years, Mac users helped others selflessly and ably across the  
internet. We had to stick together and support each other because we  
were a minority and always being attacked by PC users.

Now Mac users have become snobs who could care less about making  
people love the brand. I refuse to let that happen to me... I've been  
using, teaching and fixing Macs for too long.
