<PRE>Wow, didn't know she was still around!

Just so everyone knows, the original poster, GL, is also called the  
Macintoshlady.

She's been on this list, and I think a few others, for years. We  
rarely ever hear from her. Once in a while she'll pop up with a  
question, a good one even, but then the thread has a tendency to  
degenerate.

It works like this...she'll ask a question, a sincere one. People  
will answer her with good intentions. She'll take some of the answers  
and sort of turn them around as if people are being condensending to  
her, or treating her like she's a newbie when she's not, sometimes  
she'll claim it's a sexist thing the way she's treated, usually  
mentions she's a teacher (and then everyone thinks to themselves,  
thank god she wasn't  any of my teachers).

She'll usually refuse to believe she could have caused the problem,  
she'll then start to get in arguments with people, lots of sarcasm  
goes back and forth, the threads degenerate.

People will start thinking she is, or call her a troll. I don't think  
she's a troll, but just starts to exhibit troll behavior and won't  
let it go. Has to get the last word.

You guys can check the archives for her name, the Macintoshlady, and  
you'll see what I mean.

Best thing to do is answer her questions, but when she gets pissy and  
belligerent, just leave her alone. Don't let her frustrate you.

I'm sure I'll get bashed by her for this.

Good luck everyone!
