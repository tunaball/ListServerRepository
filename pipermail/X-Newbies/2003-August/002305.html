Thanks for the replies.Someone on another list gave me the answer to the 
&quot;can't open&quot; and it was indeed booting into open firmware and setting it 
to default (set-defaults [ return] reset-all [return]). I doubt the RAM 
was a problem, since the first 2 times OS X installed and I was able to 
run it for a couple of hours, and it recognized the RAM. I just couldn't 
boot into 9.

I think the reason I couldn't reboot into OS 9 after the first 2 
installs was that the Apple drivers had not been updated (installer said 
couldn't do it). I found a way around this at www.bombich.com (nlessing 
systems in open firmware), but couldnt try it because the installer was 
freezing. After low formatting my drive I was able to update the 
drivers, even though my HD is a non-apple (IBM Deskstar), so perhaps it 
will work next time, if there is one, that I install it. The most recent 
problems must have been caused by either the second installation or the 
erasing of it somehow messing up the open firmware settings on my CPU.
