<PRE>Hi folks,

I have made some progress with this. A little at least.

The new (to me) machine is a blue G3.  I took my OS X.2 installation 
discs and installed.  It took fine and looks great.  Remembering some 
of things posted here about my original query I was careful to use the 
same user name and password. I also note that the G3 has an ethernet 
port just as my iMac does.

Then comes the first snag.

I started trying to make what was there (appleworks icon in the dock 
for instance) mirror what I have on the iMac and in the process 
discovered that the set of 5 discs for software restoring didn't work.  
Disc 1 goes in fine (knows itself to be a software restore) and starts 
up and then tells me I have  the wrong disc, that I should insert one 
with a design matching that shown on screen. I look at the design. I 
eject the disc. The disc that it says is the *wrong disc* is has the 
design.  I try it again.  Same deal. No clue what to do about something 
like this.

Finally to come back around to my initial query.

What I want to do is copy software applications from my iMac to the G3. 
I am not averse to networking but this was not my goal, I want each 
machine to be able to run a selection of programs that I have on just 
the one right now--- MS office suite, Photoshop and a few others.

If I understand correctly what I need now is an Ethernet cable. With 
this I will be able to copy these applications to the G3... is that 
correct?  (Here would be where I would need some step by step if anyone 
has the time and inclination.)

There were mentions of &quot;sync tools&quot;  ... do I need these if I am not 
sending documents and such from one machine to the other?  That is, I 
simply want the software switched over, not documents made with the 
various applications.

Thanks for all the help so far.

It'll be gratifying to reach the stage where I could offer assistance 
to newbies myself.

jlo
