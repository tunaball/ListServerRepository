So do I, and I prefer to remember one rather than 100. But your point 
is well taken, that's why I'd like to be able to print the content of a 
keychain.

&gt;<i> It's more that I am one user with 16 computers......whereas if you are

</I>
I manage a similar number of computers, two thirds of them Win, two of 
them located some 6,000 miles from where I am. Keychain is a useful 
(and time-saving) tool for me. I can also tell you that, prior to 
Jaguar, I'd sort of given up (not without regrets) on the Mac (the 
first computer I ever owned). OS 9 and earlier was simply too limiting, 
too unstable, and too inflexible for my needs; it was simply no 
competition for Win 2k and even Win 98. I began upgrading to OS X with 
considerable reluctance, but now Jaguar is my main OS and I turn to the 
Win XPP machines only when I can't help it. My chief problem -- other 
than learning to use it to its full capacity -- is to get a reluctant 
client to move to OS X. Troubleshooting his OS 9.2.2 is a major 
headache.

&gt;<i> that doesn't mean I want it to do
</I>&gt;<i> everything for me like Windows. After all, it was touted as being more
</I>&gt;<i> powerful than the former OS and putting us in more control, not less.
</I>
Believe you me, Windows _doesn't_ do everything for you. Not even 
close. Perhaps it's a subjective feeling, but I feel much more in 
control on OS X than on OS 9 or Win, which (again, IMHO) offered a 
greater degree of user configuration and control than OS 9.
