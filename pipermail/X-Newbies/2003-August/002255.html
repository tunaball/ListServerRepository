When we say &quot;Mac&quot;, we usually mean two different operating systems, the 
&quot;Classic&quot; Mac OS, and Mac OS X. Neither is invulnerable to currently 
known malware. On one hand, there is the malware written for the 
&quot;Classic&quot; versions, which, as Randy pointed out, can also infect the 
Classic environment in OS X (just as Win viruses can infect the Virtual 
PC environment). On the other hand, (as you point out) there are the 
cross-platform macro viruses, which can infect both systems.

&gt;<i> you don't need a virus utility to protect you from Mac OS X viruses - 
</I>&gt;<i> none are yet known to exist
</I>
If that's how my post read, then I must have not expressed myself very 
well. I certainly didn't mean to get a anti-virus utility as protection 
against a future virus. An anti-virus utility is necessary for 
protection against (a) native Mac malware (see 
<A HREF="http://www.sherpasoft.org.uk/MacSupporters/macvir.html">http://www.sherpasoft.org.uk/MacSupporters/macvir.html</A> for a quick 
overview), (b) cross-platform macro viruses, (c) inadvertently 
spreading PC malware. IMHO, the greatest threat is represented by 
cross-platform viruses, that's why I stressed that an up-to-date virus 
utility is especially desirable for Mac users who share Word and Excel 
files with Win users on a regular basis.

Mac users who use Virtual PC should also consider a Win anti-virus 
utility, especially if they do downloading and e-mailing from the VPC 
environment (yes, there are a few...).
