<PRE>First, from MacintoshLady's original post, I didn't realize that the 
problem wasn't the drag and drop, but the maintenance of the text in 
the Subject field once the message was sent. That is a different issue, 
albeit related somewhat to drag and drop. In fact, as noted below, I 
agree that Mail doesn't maintain the dragged text in the subject field 
when it was placed there by drag and drop.

Second, I certainly wasn't being dismissive. I tried to do what it 
appeared ML was doing and the text dragged and stayed in the subject 
field. I didn't subsequently send the message until later when I 
confirmed the problem. By this point a number of other posts dealing 
with the issue had appeared and it seemed redundant to respond.

If you go back through the archives, you will see that I don't get 
involved in being dismissive about people's posts, I try to help and I 
don't participate in flame wars. I'm a bit offended to be accused of 
doing something of that sort. I've been on this list since the beta 
days and it bothers me how short-fused members of this list have become 
over the past year or so.
