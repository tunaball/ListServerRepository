Norman Cohen &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-newbies.html">nacohen at mac.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> First, from MacintoshLady's original post, I didn't realize that the
</I>&gt;<i> problem wasn't the drag and drop, but the maintenance of the text in
</I>&gt;<i> the Subject field once the message was sent. That is a different issue,
</I>&gt;<i> albeit related somewhat to drag and drop. In fact, as noted below, I
</I>&gt;<i> agree that Mail doesn't maintain the dragged text in the subject field
</I>&gt;<i> when it was placed there by drag and drop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, I certainly wasn't being dismissive. I tried to do what it
</I>&gt;<i> appeared ML was doing and the text dragged and stayed in the subject
</I>&gt;<i> field. I didn't subsequently send the message until later when I
</I>&gt;<i> confirmed the problem. By this point a number of other posts dealing
</I>&gt;<i> with the issue had appeared and it seemed redundant to respond.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you go back through the archives, you will see that I don't get
</I>&gt;<i> involved in being dismissive about people's posts, I try to help and I
</I>&gt;<i> don't participate in flame wars. I'm a bit offended to be accused of
</I>&gt;<i> doing something of that sort. I've been on this list since the beta
</I>&gt;<i> days and it bothers me how short-fused members of this list have become
</I>&gt;<i> over the past year or so.
</I>
. . . after my comment that the problem was real. [See below.] I am 
sorry for being so testy so early in the morning. Should have had a 
coffee first. Perhaps I came out of the gate quickly because this bug 
drives me crazy. Dragging some words from a message body to the subject 
area seems such a natural thing to do. When I first encountered it many 
moons ago I thought it was my computer, so I tested it on a few others 
to be sure.

Again, my apologies.

&gt;<i> Sorry, Norm, it's NOT that clear-cut:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Blank message window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Type a couple of words in the message area, making sure not to type
</I>&gt;<i> a carriage return or any other character that would get blamed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Highlight and drag to subject line. Heck, drag same from BBEdit
</I>&gt;<i> with show-invisibles on just to be sure there is no carriage return.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Save as draft, send to yourself, whatever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. I consistently do not get the dragged subject saved, as Macintosh
</I>&gt;<i> Lady described [OSX 10.2.6/Mail 1.2.5] and have had this problem
</I>&gt;<i> through every iteration of Mail to date.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a problem with this. Being so dismissive really isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> helpful. &lt;-- the naughty bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
