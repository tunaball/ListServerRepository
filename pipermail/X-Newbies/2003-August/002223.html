Randy offers the cool voice of reason and common sense, but I think 
he's still somewhat naive. The chief reason for absence of Mac viruses 
is neither better security, nor a better quality of users. It's simply 
that Apple has less than 5% of the market share, and that less than 5% 
percent is not in any crucial area. This has two consequences. First, 
the pool of potential authors of malware is much, much smaller than for 
Windows. (Possibly, this is even further restricted by the 
higher-income demographics of that tiny fraction of the market.) 
Second, there is virtually no incentive to attack Macs. What most 
malware authors crave is notoriety, if not for themselves at least for 
their products. There is no notoriety to be had in attacking Macs. 
Write a worm that cripples Mac e-mail systems, and you might make page 
40 of the New York Times -- if your masterpiece is particularly nasty. 
Forget about CNN or BBC anytime, let alone primetime. Write one that 
buggers Windows -- and the whole world will be talking about you.
