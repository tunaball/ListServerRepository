Like I said in all my posts, its about the very common discussion that 
everyone hears, not necessarily limited to what was posted on the list. 
Aside from that, (B) was the thesis of the article referenced on the 
list via link - that's why it came up.

It seems like you're just trying really, really hard to find something 
wrong with what I'm saying, at the expense of accuracy. If you don't 
like the thread, take the time to post a good rebuttal or just quit 
replying and let it die. Posting snide and inaccurate quips just wastes 
everyone's time.
