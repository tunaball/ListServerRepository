&gt;<i>What I want to do is copy software applications from my iMac to the G3.

&gt;<i>If I understand correctly what I need now is an Ethernet cable. With

I found a previous message from you to the list that says that you have a 
17-inch flat panel iMac.  That's good, because it means that you have two 
machines that both have FireWire.  While networking the two machines 
together using Ethernet will work, it isn't the easiest way for you to do 
what you need to do.

By far the easiest way would be to use FireWire target disk mode.  This 
allows you to connect the two computers together with a FireWire cable 
and transfer the files as if you were transfering from one drive to 
another (simple drag and drop):

One minor problem is finding someplace to purchase a FireWire cable that 
won't charge you $36, like CompUSA would want to. Here is a 6ft. one (6 
pin to 6 pin, which is what you need) for only $8:

More info on FireWire Target Disk Mode:

<A HREF="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=75414">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=75414</A>

Make sure that your G3 has all the relevant updates, especially the 
FireWire update:
<A HREF="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=31002">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=31002</A>

Connect the Firewire cable between the two Macs.  Start up your iMac with 
the &quot;T&quot; key held down until the bouncing FireWire symbol appears.  If 
necessary restart your blue &amp; white G3 to make your iMac's hard drive 
show up on the desktop.  Now simply work with the iMac's drive icon as if 
it were an external drive to your blue &amp; white G3 and drag and drop any 
software, or entire folders, that you want to copy from one machine to 
the other.

Good luck!
