</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's go with &quot;Please keep your opinions to yourself&quot; - instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;please shut up&quot; it's just a little bit more&#8230; the right way to say it:)

Thanks for giving me an opportunity to clarify that sig a little.

As should be obvious (but perhaps isn't), I don't tailor my sigs for 
just this forum -- I rotate them and they appear on ALL my outgoing 
correspondence for that day, or week, or however long till I'm bored 
with that one and switch it to another (see below).

So let me make it clear to all participants on this fine list -- I'm 
not telling anyone HERE to &quot;shut up,&quot; only those sanctomonious writers 
who attack (or proselytize the film, for that matter) the film *without 
having seen it.* To the best of my knowledge, nobody on this list has 
offered ANY opinion on Moore's film, including me.

The sig is ALSO not, contrary to the opinion of at least one list 
participant, an endorsement of the movie (except in the sense that I 
think it's important to make up your own mind about it, which would 
involve seeing it). I simply encourage every American who gives even 
the slightest damn about this country and its government to *go see the 
film* before falling mindlessly behind the hype one way or the other.

The biggest single problem in this country is not who's in charge or 
who wants to be in charge -- it's the fact that not enough of us 
*participate* in the process. &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; has already been shown 
to be a film that gets people off the fence (focus studies done in 
Michigan and elsewhere). To me, that's a good thing -- no matter which 
side of the fence they fall off TO. :)

To reiterate: none of my sigs are aimed at anyone here in particular 
and should be taken as broad statements, not list-specific. I'm not 
going to change the wording of that particular sig because it's not 
aimed at nice people like you guys, it's aimed at hypocrites in the 
media and blogosphere -- who really *should* &quot;shut up.&quot;
