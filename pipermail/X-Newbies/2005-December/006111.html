</I>
Was the subject title too unwieldy? :-)

Thing is, though, when you change the subject you break the thread 
for users of most email clients other than Mail.app.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Several applications have *an* address book, which must be noted as

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Yes, that does sometimes cause confusion, particularly for people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>transferring from Outlook/Entourage. But it really *is* quite silly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>for every internet-related app to have it's *own* address book, don't

I don't quite understand - right here you say that your only need for 
addresses is for email. But in the very next sentence you mention 
your Teledex. But Address Book can centrally hold, for each and all 
contacts, the following at least: name, nickname, postal addresses, 
telephone numbers, email addresses, web site URL, instant messaging 
handles, as well as notes.

&gt;<i>  And if I wanted to put addresses for any other purpose (to remind 
</I>&gt;<i>me what to copy when handwriting envelopes)
</I>
You can print envelopes directly from Address Book.

&gt;<i>  I used to stick them in the address book in OE (Mac) if I could not 
</I>&gt;<i>be bothered to put it in my Teledex. I knew where to go. But 
</I>&gt;<i>apparently there are zillions of other non-email related reasons?
</I>
Printing envelopes :-)

Tied to iCal reminders/meetings/tasks

Lookup for maps and directions (built-in for USA addresses, available 
support for some others from 3rd parties)

Synchronisation to personal organisers, phones

Synchronisation to .Mac online for backup and availability

[A few short of a zillion but...]

&gt;<i>  I really need to need more and lead a more complex life where 
</I>&gt;<i>addresses are needed for all kinds of other things... so that I can 
</I>&gt;<i>truly get the benefit of a &quot;simplification&quot; that only appears 
</I>&gt;<i>absurdly complicated...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;:<i>)
</I>
You should also bear in mind that the personal computer caters to a 
diverse group of users, some of whom do have differing needs and 
usage.

And even more relevant is that Apple's provision of the Address Book 
does three things for developers:

1) frees the developer from the *need* to write full address book 
code, perhaps giving them more time/resources/freedom to spend on the 
email stuff itself.

2) even if the application already has address book coded, 
facilitates calling the Address Book to supplement the info that's 
local to the app. Eudora does this.

3) gives an opportunity to conceive, implement and deliver additional 
Address Book features. An example is Google Maps directions from 
within the Address Book.
