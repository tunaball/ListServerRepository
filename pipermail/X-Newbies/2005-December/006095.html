<PRE>Heh, Heh, starting a new rumor here.  As General Motors struggles to 
stay ahead of Toyota, they will come out with a new model vehicle and 
name it &quot;Car.&quot;

Al Poulin
Anger, hate, and revenge are for the devil, forgiveness is for God, 
proactive self-defense is for the rest of us.

</I>&gt;<i> involving those apps, trying to hold a conversation with someone 
</I>&gt;<i> unfamiliar with the current Mac, trying to explain a 
</I>&gt;<i> multi-application** technique - these all suffer from those names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Several applications have *an* address book, which must be noted as 
</I>&gt;<i> distinct from *the* Address Book app. A conversation about a problem 
</I>&gt;<i> goes blooey at the &quot;OK, now open Mail&quot; point when the user launches 
</I>&gt;<i> their browser and goes to the web mail (or opens mail, in another 
</I>&gt;<i> client).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think when the &quot;i&quot; prefix started being made fun of, Steve decided 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OK, we'll just leave it off and see how you like it!&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah well, I don't suppose I'd have been impressed by the names iMail 
</I>&gt;<i> and iPages anyway. And iBook was already taken. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** example &quot;multi-application&quot; technique: emailing a bunch of holiday 
</I>&gt;<i> photos to a family member. A friend called me up earlier, while 
</I>&gt;<i> already on a call to their family computer wiz (all-PC) who was trying 
</I>&gt;<i> to instruct her in sending her batch of photos. Frustrated by 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion of &quot;compression, zip, properties&quot;, she called for more 
</I>&gt;<i> help. I said &quot;Forget all the tech stuff, make an album with the 
</I>&gt;<i> photos, use the Share menu and email it. She did so, chose 
</I>&gt;<i> medium-size, got an OK on the file size from the wiz, was momentarily 
</I>&gt;<i> disconcerted by the delay as iPhoto did its thing before handing off 
</I>&gt;<i> to Mail.app, and was then OK and done. But the PC wiz, a good guy who 
</I>&gt;<i> knows exactly what he's about, couldn't quite get any handle on what 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd told her to do. Statements like &quot;OK, now just wait for Mail to 
</I>&gt;<i> open with the message just needing addressing.&quot; or &quot;If the address is 
</I>&gt;<i> already in your Address Book...&quot; carry no audio clues about the 
</I>&gt;<i> application being used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't know, you're waiting for the rest of the info - Outlook? 
</I>&gt;<i> Eudora? Web client? An Apple-specific app? What're you using? Yes, 
</I>&gt;<i> yes, I know it's mail, but what is the *name* of the program?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those who've been helping end users for any length of time are 
</I>&gt;<i> accustomed to the users' tendency to impart generic terms. It's not 
</I>&gt;<i> Internet Explorer or Mozilla FireFox, it's &quot;my Internet&quot;. It's not 
</I>&gt;<i> Outlook Express, it's &quot;my email&quot;. When these helpers hear Mac users 
</I>&gt;<i> say &quot;Mail&quot; and &quot;Address Book&quot;, they're already leaping into 
</I>&gt;<i> clarification mode.
</I>&gt;<i> -- 
</I>&gt;<i> 'tis as said. [Reality is defined by being described]
