David:

Take a look at &quot;Mac OS: Moving files from your older Macintosh to a new 
one&quot;:
<A HREF="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25575">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25575</A>

Then follow the links from that article to others.  These articles at 
Apple's web site help make sense out of all those little, disconnected 
Help files in the Finder.

Also, at Apple's web site, you can search on related terms including 
ethernet, file sharing, apple talk, and TCP/IP, and maybe even 
connecting computes.  Years ago, I found it very helpful to borrow the 
books from the public library on Macintosh.  The networking and file 
sharing chapters were very helpful in understanding the basic ideas of 
what to do.

Today, I use David Pogue's Mac OS X, The Missing Manual series for 
basic reference.  Robin Williams also has excellent books out for 
reference.

Al Poulin
Anger, hate, and revenge are for the devil, forgiveness is for God, 
proactive self-defense is for the rest of us.
