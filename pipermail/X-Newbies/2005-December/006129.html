</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Several applications have *an* address book, which must be noted as

</I>&gt;<i> I don't quite understand - right here you say that your only need for

</I>&gt;<i> handles, as well as notes.
</I>
A Teledex is a red plastic thing which flips open and has cards in  
alphabetical order. Just to be sure. I have one main need for  
addresses on my computer and that is email. I am a lazy sod and  
sometimes write a note for non computer used addresses as in envelope  
addresses. This addition has made me seem to contradict myself. If  
you think just a tiny fuzziness to logic, you will see I am only just  
below average in intelligence and not a complete idiot... :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  And if I wanted to put addresses for any other purpose (to remind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me what to copy when handwriting envelopes)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can print envelopes directly from Address Book.
</I>
No I can't. Untill I buy another printer for this G4 or find a  
reasonable priced ethernet serial bridge or work out how to use a  
simple crossover ethernet cable to my 7300 which is connected to a  
perfectly good laser printer... And even then, i would not dream of  
printing an envelope. Why? Because it would be silly to go to the  
trouble of loading up envelopes and fishing about under my desk for  
the odd snail mail. I can't tell you how quick i am at whipping an  
envelope out of a pack, writing an address, putting on a stamp (they  
are in my wallet) etc. I am faster than Charles Bronson at the start  
of Once Upon A Time In The West when the train pulled away and he  
blasted away three low life gunmen on the other side of the rail track.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I used to stick them in the address book in OE (Mac) if I could not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be bothered to put it in my Teledex. I knew where to go. But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> apparently there are zillions of other non-email related reasons?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Printing envelopes :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i> Tied to iCal reminders/meetings/tasks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lookup for maps and directions (built-in for USA addresses, available
</I>&gt;<i> support for some others from 3rd parties)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Synchronisation to personal organisers, phones
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Synchronisation to .Mac online for backup and availability
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [A few short of a zillion but...]
</I>
  I don't know a single person who ever uses these things but I  
accept your point that there are folk... for me, these are perfectly  
useless. It is a particularly irritating MS type of thing giving  
everyone everthing because some might want somethings... But what can  
I do?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I really need to need more and lead a more complex life where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addresses are needed for all kinds of other things... so that I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> truly get the benefit of a &quot;simplification&quot; that only appears
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> absurdly complicated...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You should also bear in mind that the personal computer caters to a
</I>&gt;<i> diverse group of users, some of whom do have differing needs and
</I>&gt;<i> usage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And even more relevant is that Apple's provision of the Address Book
</I>&gt;<i> does three things for developers:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) frees the developer from the *need* to write full address book
</I>&gt;<i> code, perhaps giving them more time/resources/freedom to spend on the
</I>&gt;<i> email stuff itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) even if the application already has address book coded,
</I>&gt;<i> facilitates calling the Address Book to supplement the info that's
</I>&gt;<i> local to the app. Eudora does this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) gives an opportunity to conceive, implement and deliver additional
</I>&gt;<i> Address Book features. An example is Google Maps directions from
</I>&gt;<i> within the Address Book.
</I>&gt;<i> -- 
</I>&gt;<i> 'tis as said. [Reality is defined by being described]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The &quot;first&quot; world has gone mad with precious wanky wants.

Don't mind me, Vincent. I know you are saying intelligent things. I  
appreciate practical help and know better re addressing on X now. But  
I am in no mood to be nice about what this mad crazy over wanting  
world wants  :)
