Really more &quot;piling on&quot; than replying.

You can make some really cool looking text in Illustrator. If they  
can't be bothered to PDF their Word file (or type their two lines  
directly into the email program), perhaps I can't be bothered to PDF  
my Illustrator document. It cuts both ways . . .

&gt;<i> why would one conceive of responding to a text message with the  
</I>&gt;<i> output of an illustrator's tools? Is it somehow heinous to respond  
</I>&gt;<i> to a letter with one generated by Word?  . . .
</I>
Speaking from experience from the OS 9 days when I didn't have  
office, it can be a real pain when people just assume you have Word,  
and use it to send a one or two line message as an attached Word  
document.  Its annoying because A) why do you just assume I have this  
expensive program, and B) why are you using a word processor to send  
me two lines of plain text as an attachment?

But I agree - how does this frustration translate into a problem with  
Word?  It isn't the program, it is the *user* who is the problem.  
Don't they understand that I don't want to launch a program to read  
their two lines of text? Do they not know how to type into their  
email program?  Thankfully, this seems to have tapered off a LOT in  
the last few years, but that could be because I don't know that many  
true internet newbies anymore.

There are lots of things I hate about Word (mostly relating to the  
way it handles images), but I still use it quite a bit for cranking  
out the &quot;numbered sections&quot; kinds of documents, and circulating them  
for mark-up. Its reasonably good at that. I just don't assume that  
everyone else in the universe has it - any more than I assume they  
have Illustrator.
