<PRE>&gt;<i> From: david_elmo &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-newbies.html">david_elmo at optusnet.com.au</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to add an address to the address book in Mail without waiting
</I>&gt;<i> for the addressed person to email me (then I know how to do it!).
</I>
Open Address Book (the application in your applications folder),  
create a new &quot;card&quot; (by clicking on the + key) and enter the data.  
Address Book (the application) also functions as Mail's address book.

&gt;<i> I go to the help files.  It says:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You can add addresses to Address Book when you send and receive
</I>&gt;<i> mail, and when you view your messages and Previous Recipients list.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, &quot;when I send&quot;? Well, when is &quot;when I send&quot;? Is it when I am about
</I>&gt;<i> to send, or when I have just sent or the very moment I send it? I
</I>&gt;<i> have before me a new composed message and I have addressed it
</I>&gt;<i> lovingly by hand. I want to add it to the **ing address book. What do
</I>&gt;<i> I do?
</I>
One of several things, as explained by the help file. You could:
1. Highlight the address and right-click (control-click) to add it to  
your Address Book.
2. Click on the arrow in the Smart Address bubble, which presents a  
pop-up menu (if you're entering an email address FOR THE FIRST TIME,  
you won't get a Smart Address bubble).
3. Click on the &quot;Add to Address Book&quot; button you added to the menu  
bar (customise menu).

&gt;<i> Excuse me? What is a &quot;a Smart Address&quot; when it is at home?
</I>
Maybe it's just that you come from a Windows environment, but I  
assure you there's no need to believe that your computer is out to  
humiliate you. Everything a Mac does (and says about itself) is there  
for good reason. If you don't know what a Smart Address is (and can't  
seem to work it out from the name itself), then open the Help file  
and type in &quot;Smart Address&quot; and see what it says. You might also want  
to read the page about Tiger's redesigned Mail at Apple's own web site:
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mail">http://www.apple.com/macosx/mail</A>

&gt;<i> Honestly, the Mail design and the help files look like a diabolical
</I>&gt;<i> joke. Surely these programs should cater for people who are just
</I>&gt;<i> below average in intelligence?
</I>
Must ... resist ... urge to flame ... such a great ... opening ....

Ahem. The concept of &quot;smart addresses&quot; and many of Mail's other nifty  
features is detailed in an overview called &quot;What's New in Mail&quot; which  
can be accessed by calling up the help menu and not ignoring the main  
splash page. Why not give that a read-over and see if that doesn't  
help clear things up.

Cheers
Chas
