<PRE>Hi all,

this afternoon I tried to do a Google search but received the reply that
my request was refused as they were receiving excessive multiple
requests from my address.  It sounded like a DDOS attack coming from
from my machine.  I was advised to get some AV software and eradicate this.

I fired up Interarchy and found stuff was going to
www2.vip.ukl.yahoo.com (217.12.3.11).  Trying that in Safari got a page
not found.  I blocked the traffic with Snitch and Google resumed normal
service.  another IP was 224.0.0.251 to which regular connections were
being made.  

This has me a bit worried.  Whether it was spyware or something that
simply flooded Google with spurious packets I don't know.  The only
thing I can put it down to was a Beeblefish widget which might have been
a trojan.  It came from MacUpdate which is usually reliable.  I suspect
the thing is still installed somewhere and only Snitch is stopping it
operating, but other than using spotlight - which shows nothing - I
don't know where to look.

I've always harboured doubts about widgets - they smack too much of
Active-X for my liking with consequences we all know.  

cheers,

Chris

</PRE>
