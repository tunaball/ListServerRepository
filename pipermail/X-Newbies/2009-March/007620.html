GOOD LORD NO! I've been using Macs since 1995 and have 30 of them,  
all kinds. :-)

Since it's been ages since I used a different type of printer, that's  
all I needed to hear from others who have. Sometimes when we don't do  
something for a long time, we don't keep up with the details of the  
pitfalls etc. and we greatly appreciate the fact that Mac users are  
very willing to share what they know.

When OS X first came out, people I help asked me why I wouldn't  
recommend it yet. If you remember, 10.1 was quite 'raw' and I felt  
they would be frustrated. I mean you could not even edit your SMTP  
server without line commands and since the people I work with do not  
even know yet what a 'browser' is or how to copy and paste after 8  
years of intensive instruction, I certainly did not want them messing  
with that. When OS X became more civilized I promptly recommended  
they buy new computers and get with it.

I just finished converting the last of the OS 9ers last year when the  
web wasn't working so well for her....thanks to no upgrades. She is  
83 years old, and under my guidance for all her Mac career. I was  
able to guide her purchase of a Mac Mini with a 3rd party flat  
screen, the whole package surprisingly affordable when all tolled.  
She kept her mouse and keyboard and got some external speakers for a  
birthday gift. We worked hard one afternoon getting her set up with  
her printer, etc, and translating documents and transferring and  
getting them in folders neatly, a little lesson on how to name files  
more efficiently and now she rarely has a problem.

I have many elderly &quot;customers&quot; including my own 87-year old Dad who  
is a retired musician and adores his 24&quot; iMac and super duper iPod!

Thank you very much Randy for your reassurance. I'm so busy that if I  
had time-consuming disaster I might need to be carted off to the  
loony bin. :-)
