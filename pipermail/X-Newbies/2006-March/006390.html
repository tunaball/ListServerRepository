If you believe your external drive is set up correctly, hardware wise, 
perhaps you could try cloning with something called SuperDuper.  But 
first, you could make a disk image of a known good bootable CD or DVD 
of your OS and putting that on the external drive to test that.

Anger, hate, and revenge are for the devil, forgiveness is for God, 
proactive self-defense is for the rest of us.
