Try &quot;syntactical, semantic or comprehensive contortion&quot;. I'd say you're 
on the right path.

&gt;<i> I only do plain claptrap.
</I>
As long as it's both semantic and contorted, or only comprehensive?

&gt;<i> See original query, pray.
</I>
It was:

&gt;<i> How do I get my picture in my emails like some of you have? Will it 
</I>&gt;<i> show up then in all my email messages even to people using other mail 
</I>&gt;<i> programs?
</I>
Why was cricket incorrect? Because he said:

&gt;<i> all users of Mail (and .Mac webmail) that receive messages from you 
</I>&gt;<i> (from your .Mac address) will see this picture automatically. There is 
</I>&gt;<i> no configuration required.
</I>
That was incorrect because, as I pointed out, if the option &quot;Display 
images and embedded objects in HTML messages&quot; is turned off, the 
picture will not be seen (unless it has been previously cached). 
TheMacintoshLady's reply to the original query was

&gt;<i> This is a setting in your mail accounts prefs to show it as a link or a
</I>&gt;<i> file.
</I>
True, it was wrong in the &quot;show it as a link or file&quot; -- but it was 
right in that there was a setting that would turn the picture display 
on or off. Rather than &quot;completely and in-no-way-related-to-the-query 
incorrect&quot;, it was both partially correct, and definitely related to 
the query. And cricket was &quot;definitively&quot; wrong &quot;(and boy do I mean 
'definitively')&quot; in stating that there was no such preference. So, if 
our main concern is &quot;the elucidation of others who are better served by 
correct information than by completely erroneous offerings&quot; 
(incidentally, what about the partially erroneous offerings?), then 
surely the self-professed software entomologist (what could be more 
post-modernist than that, I wonder?) must be corrected.
