Vince, pal. That's between me and my spiritual adviser.

Beg your pardon?

&gt;<i> Fortunately cricket's reading of plain fact is as on point as your

</I>
(Why &quot;fortunately&quot;? Did you have money riding on this?) I'm not a great 
one for post-modernist claptrap, and, anyway, I'm not sure this is the 
place for semantic analyses -- or even semiotic ones, however 
interesting and revealing they might be. But -- given that we are all 
subject to making mistakes -- this might be the place for a little 
courtesy and common sense. So TheMacintoshLady made a mistake. The 
initial reply was actually:

&gt;<i> This is a setting in your mail accounts prefs to show it as a link or a
</I>&gt;<i> file. No it will not show up to people who use text, and some have it
</I>&gt;<i> turned off or only use text apps so they will just get it as an 
</I>&gt;<i> attachment.
</I>
But it was well meant, and cricket, instead of jumping with both feet 
(er, beg your pardon, all six feet, of course) on it could've said, 
&quot;That's not quite correct; perhaps you mean this preference&quot;, etc., 
etc. You know, being helpful (let alone mature), which is the point of 
this list, ain't it? Because, after all, that was the part of the issue 
of the original post. And our estimeed entomologist and Samaritan was 
neither entirely helpful, nor entirely correct. &quot;There is no 
configuration required&quot;, quotha.
