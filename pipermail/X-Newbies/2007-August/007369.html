I'm not sure what post you are referring to.  It looks like my last  
post to this list was a month ago.

&gt;<i> I treat add-ons and little programs with a very jaundiced eye,
</I>&gt;<i> especially where the program involves basic OS operations.
</I>
With the advent of OS X, Apple very consciously decided to move away  
from allowing add-on extensions to the OS that might cause a conflict  
and a problem.  So, well-written OS X add-ons are written as separate  
applications, with the benefits associated with them being so.  The  
biggest such benefit is that they run in a protected memory space, so  
if they crash they don't bring down other applications or the OS.

One or two companies have been known to add kernel extensions to OS  
X, and, not surprisingly, these companies' software has a  
corresponding reputation for instability and for causing damage to  
your computer.  Just about anything from &quot;Norton&quot; or &quot;Symantec&quot;, for  
example.

Otherwise, there is little reason to be fearful of installing a  
program that adds functionality to OS X.


&gt;<i> ...I know that
</I>&gt;<i> many add-on utilities do have proven track records and fulfill many  
</I>&gt;<i> users'

Your post sounds much more like something that someone from the  
Windows side of the aisle, rather than the Mac side of the aisle,   
would say.  Generally, on the PC, shareware is looked at quite  
suspiciously, both because it might run poorly on your computer, and  
also because it might contain a Trojan, spyware, or virus.    
Historically, even before the advent of OS X with its lack of malware  
and its protected memory, these have not been serious concerns for  
Mac users.  (I often have new Mac switchers tell me that they are  
afraid to add new software to their Mac because they are afraid of  
&quot;breaking it&quot;!  That sort of fear is unheard of among long-time Mac  
users.)

While it is true that if you are in a work environment where your  
data and the stability of your computer are paramount, it is a good  
idea to forgo adding any new software until it has been throughly  
tested on a separate computer set aside for just this purpose.  But I  
can tell you that this probably really isn't at all necessary for the  
Macintosh.  I've downloaded and tested literally hundreds (probably  
actually thousands) of shareware products over the years, and I have  
never suffered a single serious problem from doing so.  Macintosh  
shareware has traditionally be of supremely high quality.  I'm at the  
computer that I entrust my client files to right now, and it has a  
bunch of software on it from tiny developers, without a single  
problem from any of it.

It's true that some software suffers from bugs and incompatibilities,  
especially when that software is a 1.0 version.  But it is extremely  
rare that this causes a truly serious problem like data loss or  
crashing.  (Ironically, the exceptions that come to mind came from  
Apple themselves.  OS X 10.3, when first released, had a bug that  
caused users' FireWire drives to lose data.  A similar problem  
occured with the release of OS X 10.4 and LaCie FireWire drives.)  So  
it is a good idea to hold off on installing newly released  software  
until after you have heard the feedback from other users.  (I  
personally usually wait a month or two before upgrading to a new  
major version of the Mac OS.)

If you are really interested in learning about new software  
experiences, or software incompatibilities, before installing it  
yourself, it is not at all hard to find out about this, you can  
follow these Web sites daily:

Macintouch
<A HREF="http://www.macintouch.com">http://www.macintouch.com</A>

But the general paranoia that is rampant among Windows users  
concerning adding or changing anything on your computer, is simply  
out of place with regard to the Macintosh.  It seems to me that it is  
especially a bad idea to be promoting FUD (fear, uncertainty, and  
doubt) on a Mac newbies list.
