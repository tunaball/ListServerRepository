<PRE>Jpegs are jpegs. AFAIK, all digital cameras upload their images as 
jpegs. You may or may not have to add the &quot;.jpg&quot; extension to the file 
name, but any program that can open jpegs can be coaxed to open the 
file.

Usually the easiest app in OS 9 to open the jpegs is PictureViewer, a 
component of the (free) player version of QuickTime. I really like 
PictureViewer for OS 9 images.

My second choice for jpeg or gif files is any internet browser. Just 
drop the image file on IE or Netscape, or whatever.

Third choice for me (but many people's first choice) is Graphic 
Converter. It's shareware, and worth the $35, but you can use it for 
free if you're willing to tolerate a delay.

A problem in PC to Mac transfers is often the compression method used 
on the dark side machine. They have an affinity for zip files, which 
aren't used very much over here in the sunshine. Not to worry! Aladdin 
Systems' Stuffit Expander will expand zip files as well as the usual 
hqx and sit files. (www.aladdinsystems.com) Maybe this is part of your 
problem.

Finally, (finally specifically addressing your comment) the only 
proprietary Microsoft format I can think of are their formats for 
Windows Media Player files. A reader that will read most of these files 
is available from MS at their website: mactopia.com

The sureest way (and probably the most nerve-wracking for a newby) to 
control the file that opens a document by changing the creator (and 
possibly the type) in the file's resource fork. I use an old program 
called File Typer in OS 9; other people seem to like File Buddy. In OS 
X, FileType is a freeware program that does the trick very nicely. But 
these programs are not for the first ninety days or so. ;-)

HTH.
