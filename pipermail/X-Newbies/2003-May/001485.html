<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Gregory Cortelyou &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-newbies.html">chefgreg at mac.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is so annoying. Whenever I try to send a photo taken with my 
</I>&gt;<i> camera and
</I>&gt;<i> processed in iphoto to someone on AOL, they can't open it.
</I>
Here is the solution.

If you are sending a single photo, be SURE that it has the extension 
.jpg on the filename. This is a common mistake Mac users make. AOL's 
idiotic server software does not know what to do with ANY file that 
does not have an extension on it. A single photo should send properly 
if it has .jpg on it. If it still doesn't or you want to send multiple 
photos, see next paragraph

For multiple or problem photos, before attaching the photos to your 
email, use Aladdin's DropZip to make a ZIP file of it. Stuffit Expander 
can read Zip files just as easily as SIT files and that way you can 
send the photo to anyone on any platform without a worry.

Finally, another option for .Mac owners (and probably any other people 
with web space) is to make a quick-n-dirty web page of your photos and 
simply send the URL in email. That way everyone can see them who 
*wants* to, and the people who weren't interested don't have to deal 
with MBs of photos in their inbox.

James Lileks, on Apple's iMovie versus XP's Moviemaker:
&quot;Was [my bro-in-law's] machine cheaper? Yes. But time is money; I've 
never had to claw my way through the sodden mess of a corporate website 
looking for the one driver that will let me do what I want to do. I've 
never had to spend a Sunday afternoon trying to understand what iMovie 
wants me to do, because it does what *I* want it to do. He said that 
Moviemaker made him feel stupid, because he couldn't figure out the 
simplest tasks.
I'll say this for his machine, though: if he ever wants to back up that 
3.3 GB movie file on floppy disks, he's all set.&quot;
