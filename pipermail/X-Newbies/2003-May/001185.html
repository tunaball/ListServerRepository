I have a lite-on 48x24x48 which boots and works. I just did a reinstall  
of OS 9.2 and OS X.2 using it on a new HD.  It is supported in OS X.2  
with iTunes, but don't know about the 52x. I mainly use Toast 5.2 but  
you need 5.2.1 for the OS  10.2.5 update. I find iTunes kind of awkward  
but is convenient for burning your lists from MP3 to Audio CD.

BTW, I bought this under the name Buslink for only $20. I believe  
Cendyne sold some Lite-on. Look on box and see if has a &quot;LTR&quot; plus  
model number at your local OfficeMax, stapes, etc. But it doesn't  
always list it on the box. Cendenye did but Buslink didn't. With these  
companies you never know what you are going to get. I've gotten 2  
entirely different brands from I/O magic which was suppose to be  
48x12x48 and one of them turned out to be a 52x24x52 but I used them in  
PC's.

I just bought a Cendyne but it wasn't a Lite-on . It said on the box  
48x12x48 but turned out to be 48x24x48. It doesn't have a brand name  
that I can tell but it gives model number 4824P, so I guess it would be  
considered generic. But it seemed to worked pretty good in my Beige G3  
Mac without any flash upgrade. Toast 5.2 recognized it but didn't test  
it for iTunes for some reason. Booted and everything. I've tried some  
others in Mac's  before I put them in PC's and they don't all work; as  
some will hang; at least for me. Sometimes if you get them flash  
upgraded on a PC, they will work. The only thing lately is that I find  
more CDRW with contoured front covers which look nice but they will not  
fit the Beige G3 Bezels correctly. I imagine they will fit the firewire  
cases if they are completely opened in the front. But I've long had my  
Beige G3 cover off and have sheet of plastic on top to accommodate  
other drives.

Also go to accelerate your mac:

There's an interesting article. It really praises the 48x lite-on CDRW  
but for PC:

I have a Beige G3 DT with a rev b rom upgrade and haven't tested  
whether it works in a rev A.
