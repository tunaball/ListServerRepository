Hi Anne,

I'm sure you will get many different points of view on this.  I'm going 
to say this--put it where it is the most convenient/least irritating 
for you.  Try it out for several days or a week in each location and 
see which you like the best.  (Sort of like voting for 
politicians--it's not which is best, but which is least bad. ^_^ )  You 
can set your Dock to hide, so that it &quot;disappears&quot; from the Desktop 
except when you need it.  This way it won't cover anything except 
momentarily when you are selecting something from it.

I put my Dock where I'm most comfortable with it--where I instinctively 
want to go to &quot;find&quot; it with my mouse--on the bottom.  I make it small 
enough so that it doesn't cover the resize widget if I have full-sized 
windows open (which I rarely do).  I do not have it set to hide, since 
I am often switching between apps and don't like to wait that fraction 
of a second for it to &quot;unhide&quot; itself.

I don't like it on the right, because that's where new files/folders 
are created by default.  I don't like it on the left because that's too 
far over for me to mouse if I need to access it (I have a dual monitor 
set up).  I also have 42 items in it permanently, so I need the extra 
width that having it along the bottom allows.

HOWEVER, these are my personal preferences; other folks have different 
ones, as I notice each time I work on an OS X system here in our lab.

Play with it and see what you like best; you're the only one who can 
provide the &quot;correct&quot; answer.

Gretchen
