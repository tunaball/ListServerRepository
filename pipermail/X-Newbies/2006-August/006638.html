<PRE>I just installed a new hard drive in my G4/533/10.2.8. Don't know if 
this makes any difference or not: the new drive is set to the slave 
position, but I have it set to be the startup drive. I made a clone of 
my original drive using Superduper. Everything seems to be fine, except 
for the fact that when I click on an item in the dock to open a new 
program, it opens with an additional icon down at the &quot;far&quot; end of the 
dock and the little black triangle that's under open programs is under 
the new additional icon rather than the original icon that 
&quot;permanently&quot; resides in the dock. Any idea what's going on and how to 
change it back?

Now for the Mail issue: About a week ago (before installing the new 
hard drive) my darling 16 year old daughter decided it would be good to 
put a bunch of her CD's onto the computer so she could play them in 
iTunes. At the time I only had about 3 gig's of free space left on my 
40 GB hard drive. She came to me and said: &quot;Dad, the computer says that 
it's out of space. What should I do?&quot; I deleted the new music and 
restarted the computer. Everything seemed OK except that since then, 
the action of the junk mail folder has changed. It used to be that 
after I quit Mail, anything that was in the junk mail folder was 
automatically deleted. Now, the junk mail stays in the folder until I 
delete it myself. Is there a setting somewhere that will put it back to 
the &quot;Delete after quitting&quot; status? I've checked the rules for what to 
do with junk mail, but I don't see a setting for doing what it used to 
do. Any help for this problem?
Thanks very much.
