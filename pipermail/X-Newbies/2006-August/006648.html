</I>Hi Vincent,
I do have the old drive still connected. It is in the &quot;master&quot; position 
with the new drive in the &quot;slave&quot; position. I tried just dragging the 
icons off the dock and dragging the application back on. Didn't work. 
What finally did work was: clicking on the icon in the dock, dragging 
the new icon, which then opened up, to the position right next to the 
original, and finally dragging the original off the dock. Don't know 
why that worked, but it did.
Since installing the new drive, I've found a few more settings which 
had to be changed, mainly(perhaps only) dealing with downloads. A few 
programs, SuperDownload for instance still pointed to my old original 
hard drive as the location to put downloads.
Curious about why you ask if the old drive was still connected?
Thanks for your response,
Mark
