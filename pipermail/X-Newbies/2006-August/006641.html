<PRE>Sorry of the delay, but I hope this helps.

True, it makes no difference that the new drive is set as slave.  I 
suspect that the Dock retains its original &quot;aliases&quot; from your original 
drive.  Try dragging the aliases out of the dock; they will go &quot;poof.&quot;  
Then drag the corresponding applications' icons to the dock.  Then 
things should behave.  You might test this with one alias/icon first.

</I>&gt;<i> Now for the Mail issue: About a week ago (before installing the new 
</I>&gt;<i> hard drive) my darling 16 year old daughter decided it would be good 
</I>&gt;<i> to put a bunch of her CD's onto the computer so she could play them in 
</I>&gt;<i> iTunes. At the time I only had about 3 gig's of free space left on my 
</I>&gt;<i> 40 GB hard drive. She came to me and said: &quot;Dad, the computer says 
</I>&gt;<i> that it's out of space. What should I do?&quot; I deleted the new music and 
</I>&gt;<i> restarted the computer. Everything seemed OK except that since then, 
</I>&gt;<i> the action of the junk mail folder has changed. It used to be that 
</I>&gt;<i> after I quit Mail, anything that was in the junk mail folder was 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically deleted. Now, the junk mail stays in the folder until I 
</I>&gt;<i> delete it myself. Is there a setting somewhere that will put it back 
</I>&gt;<i> to the &quot;Delete after quitting&quot; status? I've checked the rules for what 
</I>&gt;<i> to do with junk mail, but I don't see a setting for doing what it used 
</I>&gt;<i> to do. Any help for this problem?
</I>
In Mail Preferences, open the Accounts pane, then select Special 
Mailboxes, and reset the instructions for Junk.
