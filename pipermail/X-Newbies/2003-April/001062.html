<PRE> This is a copy of a letter I had sent to another list. I had a lot of
suggestions, which I will display, but I still can't install Jaguar. I have
installed OS X 10.5 on a separate partition. Thanks for any suggestions.
Bill Greene
 
I'm running a beige g3 with 352 mb ram and my hard drive is a 40 GB Seagate
Ultra ATA Barracuda . I have partition my drive and the 1st is 7.5 GB and
the 2nd is 29 GB. On my 2nd partition I'm running 9.2.2 and have been for
some time. I had installed 0S X 1.5 on my 1st partition with no problems.
The problem comes when I try to install OS X 2. ( I'm using the full
install, 2 disks) and I get within 6 minutes of the 1st disk finishing
installation when the monitor goes black and I can't get it to finish. I
have set my energy saver on 9.2.2 so that it never goes off but same
problem. I have sat at the monitor and have tried tapping the space bar at
least once a minute and still the same. I used the disk utility on the cd
when I partitioned the drive and each time after that I would erase that
partition with disk utility. No matter what I tried same results. I get to
the same 6 minute mark and nothing. I then have to reboot.
I called Apple support- they had no Idea.

Well so far not too encouraging advice. Several asked if I had tried booting
from the Jaguar Disk. Yes at least 10 times. One suggestion that possibility
I had a bad cd disk and to try to copy to my hd. That was no problem.
Another suggestion was to use a custom installation and use basic
installation but that was what I tried to do with no luck. Unfortunately the
following letter from Brian seems closer to the mark. Thanks to all who so
quickly responded. Bill Greene

I would not recommend for one moment the idea of moving a drive to a
different system to accomplish the installation. An installation is
customized (by the installer) for the specific hardware it detects. I think
this option is asking for trouble.

What I have done when I encountered this with an iBook recently was to use
an external firewire CDR/RW drive. The system mounted the CD correctly (from
the external drive) , then restarted from the 10.2 CD and installed the OS
just fine.

Mark 
Thanks Mark, but on the restart the disk would not boot as operating system
on a restart from my external CD R. Bill
