<PRE>Yeah Charles, I know what I just got isn't &quot;modern&quot; in those
terms. But compared to the SE's, LC's, PowerCenter's,
Performa's I'm used to running on the Mac side of things, it
&gt;<i>IS&lt; &quot;modern&quot;, OK? What I meant was that it's the first
</I>machine supported as running OSX that I own. Does that help?

I do (now) have &quot;legal&quot; disks not only for OSX 10.2.2, but
also OS 9.1. But guess what? For some strange reason, I
wouldn't be turning to YOU for help at this point if you
were the only Mac user on the planet.

(Somebody get the boy some PRUNE JUICE.)

&gt;<i> From: &quot;Glenn McGaha Miller&quot; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-newbies.html">gm2 at visionary.nu</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> So I buy this Beige G3 off eBay which is to be my first
</I>&gt;<i> foray into the &quot;modern&quot; era.
</I>
You mean the &quot;ancient&quot; era. The beige G3 were phased out in
1997.
That's *six years ago.* The only place that computer would
be called
&quot;modern&quot; is in a severely underfunded school system.

That's prior to Windows 98 coming out. Geez, we Mac users
really *are*
ahead of the pack aren't we?? :)

I mean, congrats on your purchase and I sincerely hope you
enjoy it,
but I would not under *any* circumstances compare it to a
&quot;modern&quot;
computer except possibly in the fact that you can run Mac OS
X on it.

&gt;<i>  Said computer comes equipped
</I>&gt;<i> with two 4gb drives: One is 9.2.2 and the other is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;supposedly&quot; 10.2. When I let this machine boot as it
</I>wants
&gt;<i> to, there is momentarily a white background with an Apple
</I>&gt;<i> momentarily and then the slashed 0 symbol. Holding down
</I>&quot;c&quot;
&gt;<i> while booting gets me into the 9.2.2 drive which then
</I>offers
&gt;<i> to format the other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question is, is the OsX drive toast or can something be
</I>&gt;<i> done to reclaim whatever is on it?
</I>
If you do not have the original system CDs for this machine,
you
probably have an illegal copy of 10.2 (or whatever) on that
other drive
(actually, I wonder if you really have two drives; you
probably have
ONE hard drive with two *partitions* on it).

I would recommend that you a) buy a copy of 9.2.2 or OS X
(whichever
you have the most interest in running) from a reputable
dealer (yes,
9.2.2 is still available, just not from Apple). Then you
should erase
the hard drive(s) and install the OS of your choice. This
will give you
a fresh, clean, legal system with no problems that you can
set to work
the way you like.

_Chas_

&quot;That the PC world would doggedly stick to a dull,
unimaginative,
clinical term like 'IEEE 1394' (notice how it just rolls off
the tongue
- NOT) for the sole purpose of *saving a few pennies* over
using an
imaginative, exciting, visually-stimulating term like
'FireWire' tells
you EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW about the PC world and that
whole
industry-wide mindset.&quot; - Me, March 2003
