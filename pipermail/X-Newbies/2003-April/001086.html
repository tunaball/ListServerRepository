<PRE>&gt;<i> From: &quot;Glenn McGaha Miller&quot; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-newbies.html">gm2 at visionary.nu</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> So I buy this Beige G3 off eBay which is to be my first
</I>&gt;<i> foray into the &quot;modern&quot; era.
</I>
You mean the &quot;ancient&quot; era. The beige G3 were phased out in 1997. 
That's *six years ago.* The only place that computer would be called 
&quot;modern&quot; is in a severely underfunded school system.

That's prior to Windows 98 coming out. Geez, we Mac users really *are* 
ahead of the pack aren't we?? :)

I mean, congrats on your purchase and I sincerely hope you enjoy it, 
but I would not under *any* circumstances compare it to a &quot;modern&quot; 
computer except possibly in the fact that you can run Mac OS X on it.

&gt;<i>  Said computer comes equipped
</I>&gt;<i> with two 4gb drives: One is 9.2.2 and the other is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;supposedly&quot; 10.2. When I let this machine boot as it wants
</I>&gt;<i> to, there is momentarily a white background with an Apple
</I>&gt;<i> momentarily and then the slashed 0 symbol. Holding down &quot;c&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> while booting gets me into the 9.2.2 drive which then offers
</I>&gt;<i> to format the other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question is, is the OsX drive toast or can something be
</I>&gt;<i> done to reclaim whatever is on it?
</I>
If you do not have the original system CDs for this machine, you 
probably have an illegal copy of 10.2 (or whatever) on that other drive 
(actually, I wonder if you really have two drives; you probably have 
ONE hard drive with two *partitions* on it).

I would recommend that you a) buy a copy of 9.2.2 or OS X (whichever 
you have the most interest in running) from a reputable dealer (yes, 
9.2.2 is still available, just not from Apple). Then you should erase 
the hard drive(s) and install the OS of your choice. This will give you 
a fresh, clean, legal system with no problems that you can set to work 
the way you like.

_Chas_

&quot;That the PC world would doggedly stick to a dull, unimaginative, 
clinical term like 'IEEE 1394' (notice how it just rolls off the tongue 
- NOT) for the sole purpose of *saving a few pennies* over using an 
imaginative, exciting, visually-stimulating term like 'FireWire' tells 
you EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW about the PC world and that whole 
industry-wide mindset.&quot; - Me, March 2003
