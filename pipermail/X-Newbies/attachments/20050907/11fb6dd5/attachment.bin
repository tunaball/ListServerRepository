My college age son called me tonight frustrated because his iBook
(running Tiger - not sure what version) doesn't want to connect to the
internet now. It worked earlier in the evening, but not now. When he
goes to the networking  location in his system preferences he gets
this message: <fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>Your cable for
internet is connected but your computer does not have an IP address
and could not connect to the internet. I had him try to restart and he
got the following message: 10.1.101.28 in use by 00:08:a1:16:9e:55,
dhcp server 10.1.0.222.

Here's what he's tried:

1. Switching connection locations. His roommate's computer connects to
the internet, so my son tried plugging into the wall port that his
roommate was using. Didn't make any difference.

2. <fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>I also had him run disk
permissions - from the hard drive, not from his original disks. (His
original disks are here at home, not with him.) Didn't help.

3. Had him try to set up a new location from within the Network area
of System Preferences. Didn't help.


Any other ideas? Any other information you need about his setup.
Thanks in advance for your help.</fontfamily>
