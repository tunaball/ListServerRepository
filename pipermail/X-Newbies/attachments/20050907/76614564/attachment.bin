Thank you for your answer but according to the "Firmware" window I am
supposed to <italic>start it</italic> while holding the power button,
<italic>not shutting it down</italic>...  that is what's supposed to
start the "Firmware Updater"... 

So still, I am not sure if this is important or not.  And, could I
hurt my computer insisting on turning it on like this?

Best,

Carole

Yep. There is a setting in "power savings" to change this.

<excerpt>Hello,

I have a G5, and I am running 10.3.9.

I did run the Software update but I seem to be unable to update the
"Firmware Update 5.1.8f7".


A window comes up: It tells me to shut down and to restart by pressing
the Power button. I am supposed to get a "long tone or see the power
button light flashing... the firmware starts automatically. A status
bar shows the progress of the update. You may see more than one status
bar....etc"


None of this happens.  I went to the www.apple/support.  I got the
same info.


Am I not holding the button long enough (I am a little nervous about
ruining my computer doing this) ? Is it important that I do this ?  Or
should I just not bother?

Thanks for the imput.


Best, Carole</excerpt>
