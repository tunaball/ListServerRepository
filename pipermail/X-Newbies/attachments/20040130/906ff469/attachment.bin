I've recently lost keyboard control of sound level on my G4/533 -
10.2.6. I can adjust the sound level by going into System Preferences,
but the keyboard no longer adjusts the sound level. 

Any ideas as to how to fix this? I have run Diskwarrior (the older OS
9 version) and it didn't help any.

Thanks in advance for any ideas.

Regards,

Mark
