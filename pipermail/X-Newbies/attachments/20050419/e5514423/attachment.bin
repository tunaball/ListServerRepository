Hi Alex,


Thanks for your mail

Would you try the Pic Blanc tunnel or the Glacier de Sarenne if you
were a novice skier? This is definitely a non-newbie subject. IMHO,
until you can describe yourself as an expert and are comfortable with
rebooting your Mac in single-user mode and reconfiguring your machine
from the CLI, forget about it. Also, IMHO, what the above apps do is
mostly troubleshooting, rather than maintenance. I'm not sure a novice
user needs to run them on a regular basis.

I do not agree with you ; you can use Xupport ; it does it very well,
a Newbie can use it :-)

You do not need "</fontfamily>rebooting your Mac in single-user mode
