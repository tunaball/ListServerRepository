Thanks all for your help. I eventually got the upgrade to work, first
to 10.2.5, (thanks for the link John), then to 10.2.6, then to 10.2.8
via software update (then another software update for all the
'security updates'). My machine is now running spot on after a lot of
headaches and worry.....thanks again for your help.
