Hi Randy


Thanks for your answer


So what is the need for applications like MOX that also "pre-bind" ?

What is it doing ?

It is doing what is known as "pre-binding".  That is, when a program 

launches under OS X, it automatically opens a bunch of supporting
files.  


Prebinding speeds up application launch in the future by creating a 

"list" of what files are needed to launch an application, where they 

reside on the disk, and the order they need to be read and loaded.
