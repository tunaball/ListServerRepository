Thanks for the suggestion - no, the problem does not occur when
setting up a new user. Which preference file might  be the culprit
here? 


Another strange thing now though that I've discovered - when I first
start up my computer, I don't have keyboard control of the sound
level. However, if I log out, log in as a new user, log out again, log
back in as my "original" self, I now have keyboard control of the
sound. Any thoughts as to what's going on or what I can/should do
about it?


Thanks again for any help with this.

Mark
