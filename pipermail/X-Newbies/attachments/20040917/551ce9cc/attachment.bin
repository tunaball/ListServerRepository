Hi all,


I recently had to do an archive and install due to huge problems I had
trying to sort out a dragging problem. This has left me back at a bog
standard system 10.2. Software update is tripping up trying to install
the 10.2.8. combo update. Downloading the combo update from the Apple
site also falls over during installation. According to the
documentation Apple provides, this seems to be a well known problem
and they advise updating first to 10.2.6. then software update should
be able to update to 10.2.8. Only problem is that the 10.2.6 download
they suggest requires 10.2.5. so, how do I update from 10.2?


Any ideas?
