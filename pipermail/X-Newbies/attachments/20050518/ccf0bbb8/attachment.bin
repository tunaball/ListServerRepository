Hi,


I have just started using iTunes, both to d/l from the Apple Music
Store and record my old audiotapes.


Mostly due to the latter, where I have recorded several versions of
each song, the main Library is a horrible mess.

This is not a big problem, because the playlists do sort things out
nicely.


But, I really cannot look at the Library anymore, it makes me
cross-eyed.


Any suggestions?
