McGibney's post response of 10 April:

Hello John: I read your inputs a few days ago where you were
responding to someone's "slow Start Up." You also recommended running
an Apple Script, which I tried, but it gave me an error right at the
beginning of the script after clicking Compile.

I did as you recommended: "<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param>In order
to run this script, simply open the application Script Editor

(located in Applications/AppleScript on a standard installation),
create a new file, paste the above script, click "Compile" then click
"Run." You will be asked for your administrator password several times.


Any thoughts or ideas.


Thanks in advance and regards, Bob</fontfamily></color>
