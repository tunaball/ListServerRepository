Boy!  None of this sounds like Newbies talk to me.  It is
incomprehensible to me.  I'm a <underline>real</underline> basic
Newbie, who worries about things like how external drives work as
backups, and which is best to use, and how much do they cost, and
stuff like that. . . . Leah

not just "another package system like Fink". Fink installs a GNU/SYSV

MacPorts directly leverages OS X's UNIX environment.

I'm not sure where you get that idea from what I can see fink goes out
of its way to avoid messing with OSX, the whole thing lives is /sw

MacPorts is a collection of UNIX/POSIX software ported to OS X. It
uses and leverages OS X's UNIX. Fink installs an entire GNU
environment: libraries, headers, and utilities. To use Fink
effectively you have to put /sw at the front of your path, thus Fink
requires you to interpose it on top of, or in my view, in place of OS
X's native UNIX facilities.
