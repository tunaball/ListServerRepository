<excerpt>Hi all,


I'm setting up a mixed network - 1 Mac, 1 PC and two printers.  Both

printers are to be accessible from either computer. This will be set up

using manual (fixed) IP addresses.


Some points:


Do the IP addresses need to be consecutive or can they be more or less

random within a given range - 10.0.0.X or whatever?

it does everything for you

I have just installed an HP Color Laserjet 2550 on 4 MAC, a dream !

	you go in <color><param>FFFF,0000,0000</param>printer setup utility</color>

	you <color><param>FFFF,0000,0000</param>add</color>

	you <color><param>FFFF,0000,0000</param>select rendez vous</color>
