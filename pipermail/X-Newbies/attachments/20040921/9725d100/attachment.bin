Hi


Do you have the full error message ?


What is the size of the PDF file produced ?

The computer is a G5/2Ghz with 1.5Gbs Ram. System 10.3.4

The printer is an HP 2500 CM Professional Series Colour Printer with

postscript. It is connected to a network via Ethernet. On the network
are a

number of PC's that print to this printer as well.


The problem is:

Printing from the G5 takes ages compared to the PC's.

Using Macromedia FreeHand MX most pages come out with nothing on
except for

the following type of message:


POSTSCRIPT ERROR: undefined OFFENDING COMMAND:

VMSTATUS max: 7720064 avail: 6477900 level: 2


The max: and avail: numbers change depending on which file one tries to

print.


There is a workaround by making a PDF and then printing but the prints
take

ages to come out - sometimes hours!


If one just prints from Microsoft word - the prints are fine and come
out

relatively quickly.


I suspect that the printer needs additional ram but need confirmation
of

this before I can persuade the powers that be to purchase extra ram.


More - is that the windows pc's print to this printer easily and
quickly. So

the manager is not convinced that extra ram needs to be placed into
this

printer - if in fact the printer needs extra ram...


I have posted this question before but had no response, so Im hoping
someone

can offer some sort of advice now...


Kind regards

Gen
