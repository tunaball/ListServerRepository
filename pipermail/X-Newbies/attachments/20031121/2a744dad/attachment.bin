I have a friend who's not on this list who's come down with a strange
problem with his G3 iMac. Here's what he told me:


<SMALLER><X-FONTSIZE><PARAM>10</PARAM>I brushed the keyboard nervously
while speaking to my wife. I was waiting for a web page to appear on
AOL. All my colors reversed. I am typing white letters on a black
background right now! I went into screen effects, desk top, colors,
calibrate, millions of colors, etc. Nothing worked. I reset about ten
times. The colors are correct for two seconds, then change to this
kind of "negative" looking theme.

I formed another user, and the colors were fine, but all my files are
on MY identity. Very odd problem. 

I have an Imac G3 with 305megs of Ram and 10 Gigs of HD. OSX right of
the box, first addition. No updates.


</X-FONTSIZE></SMALLER>Any ideas about what's wrong with his machine?
He can access his files now from a new user that he's created, but
we're wondering if it's a symptom of something more serious.


Thanks for any ideas about this.


Mark
