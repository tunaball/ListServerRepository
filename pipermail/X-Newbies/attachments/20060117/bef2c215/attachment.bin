I've just encountered my first problem using Software Update.
<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param><x-tad-smaller>I have Safari
1.3.1 and tried downloading 1.3.2. It seemed to install normally but
would not open. It sorta blinks but nothing happens. I downloaded a
second time directly from the Apple site with the same results. (1.3.1
remained within my Applications folder and still functions normally.)


Following some advice on a Discussions forum on the Apple site, I
tried removing the following files one by one to the desktop and
attempted to open after each move:


/Users/YourUsername/Library/Safari/Downloads.plist

/Users/YourUsername/Library/Safari/History.plist

/Users/YourUsername/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist


I still could not open 1.3.2.


Does anyone have other suggestions?
