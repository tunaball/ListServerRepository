I am not the one who is keeping this going. It is Alex and others 
trying to discuss it with Alex. I don't even understand what Alex is 
saying which is why I asked him to drop it at least 10 posts ago.

Well, look back and see who is doing the discussing and get it right. 
YOU also have SOME nerve to suggest I &quot;trolled&quot; this problem in the 
first place.

It is also I who have repeatedly asked them to stop discussing it since 
when I went to the person's office on Monday, I fixed it for once and 
for all, no more problems, no more need to discuss it for my sake. 
HOWEVER, if they want to talk about it they have a RIGHT. They know it 
is not for my benefit at this point.

You are unreal and again, have some nerve..
