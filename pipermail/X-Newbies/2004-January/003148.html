Not true. As soon as the quotes were removed, the file became an AW 
file complete with icon. Without it, the file stayed white and the 
application would not let you choose it, it stayed greyed out. TRY IT! 
I saw it with my own eyes.

Yes and I tried them all. Not only over the phone but I did myself when 
I got there....they would neither drag over the icon, nor open with, 
nor get info, nor by contextual menu.....

&gt;<i>

</I>
Why is it that after posting at least 4 times that the problem IS 
indeed solved you don't believe me? Try it yourself. Create a file from 
AW and name it like this:

&quot;somefile-2.cwk&quot; (include the quotes)

Mail it to yourself then try to open it with clicking and choosing the 
application.
Tell me what happens.

I left the client with both problems completely solved...
