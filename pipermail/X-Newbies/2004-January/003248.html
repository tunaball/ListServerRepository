If 98 works for you, the only reason to update is to avoid using the 
Classic environment. If that's not a problem, then there's no reason to 
go to Office X. Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien -- one of the basic rules 
of computing.

</I>
Who are you disagreeing with? I don't think anyone here is saying that.

Word is the best option available -- if you need to collaborate with 
other Word users. Word X may be the best option available -- if you are 
on OS X and you have sophisticated word processing needs. It may not be 
(e.g., it isn't for me because of lack of support for Unicode) -- but 
it's difficult to match the price.

&gt;<i> Having used it for many years, I find it a nerve-wrecking tool, which

</I>
The tyranny of majority. Believe it or not, most users find such 
features useful and time-saving. Those of us that don't must master the 
programme and disable many of its built-in features. That's always the 
first thing I do, and I've never had the experience you describe. It's 
the price you pay for being a minority. As a Mac user, you should be 
used to it by now...
