While the normal unix routines don't have any effect on his issue, they 
are not related to the utilities folder at all. My first guess would 
be: it's on, but asleep, in which case the cron jobs won't run.

BUT: the utilities folder should definitely be put back in 
/applications, since Apple installers don't bother to look for the 
location of, for instance, Disk Utility.app. They just blindly slap in 
the updated files. Since OS X apps are mostly folders packaged to look 
like applications (.app extension, so it's treated as an application 
rather than a folder), they're still folders, so you might wind up with 
what LOOKS like disk utility, but which only really contains a couple 
of updated resource files.

Old-time users who are used to moving apps where they want them, and 
new users who don't know any better anyway are most likely to be bitten 
by this.

Whether or not this is correct installer behavior is a moot point for 
purposes of this questions. From a support standpoint, the folder must 
be put back, and the user taught not to move it, in order to prevent 
further more serious problems. If your users don't mind doing archive 
installs and manually removing old versions from wherever they put 
them, then they can leave it as is. This is NOT recommended.
