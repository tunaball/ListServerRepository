My experience is the opposite of the above on almost all accounts.

I concur that years ago HP's build quality and attention to the 
availability of drivers was excellent. I find however that current 
product, especially multifunction units, ink jet printers and 
scanners suffer from cheap quality and a lamentable tardiness in 
bringing adequate drivers to market.

I also see the opposite in my impression of the lists to which I 
subscribe. Of twelve Mac-specific and five 
graphics/printing-specific, I get the impression (for printing) that 
Brother, Canon and Epson support is good to excellent, HP's is 
atrocious and that Epson gives excellent output at the expense of 
clogging on some models in some environments. I also get the 
impression that Epson gives excellent value in their scanners but are 
sometimes slow to add support for older scanning and multifunction 
devices.

I continue to be comfortable with most HP network Postscript printers 
especially since it is now of little consequence that even they now 
use Postscript emulation. But I've experienced better durability and 
compatibility with Brother products currently. I've no experience or 
impression of Epson laser printing.

Up to three years ago I gave advice as follows:
    &quot;Use Epson ink jet tech for best results, Canon ink jets for best 
non-art-critical value, use HP lasers and avoid Lexmark.&quot;

Now, I'll say:
    &quot;Use Epson or Canon ink jet tech for best results, Canon or Epson 
Durabrite-ink ink jets for best non-art-critical value, Brother 
personal lasers, HP network lasers and avoid Lexmark, and avoid HP 
ink jets.&quot;

None of my comments pertain to colour lasers, CAD output or high-end 
non-art printing.
