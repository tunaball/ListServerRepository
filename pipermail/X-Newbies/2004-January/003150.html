I'm talking both, since the auto opening in the right app won't work if 
they aren't linked...........

I know exactly how it works.

&gt;<i> Now you see what I meant. When you double-clicked

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;something.cwk&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finder should have told you it had no app registered to handle this

</I>&gt;<i> open it (and, by default, go straight to the Applications folder). If 
</I>&gt;<i> AppleWorks was greyed out, you should have chosen Show All 
</I>&gt;<i> Applications, then it should have become available. If it didn't, 
</I>&gt;<i> there was a problem with the system.
</I>
IT DIDN'T BUT THERE WASN'T since there were 500 other .cwk files that 
were associated properly. Taking away the &quot;&quot; fixed it immediately. But 
you seem to continue to ignore this fact. Somehow, the &quot;&quot; caused AW to 
NOT be available no matter what was done. I have done this HUNDREDS of 
times over the phone with MANY people...so I know how to do it.


&gt;<i>  Alternatively, if you did a Get Info &gt; Open With &gt; etc., and again, 
</I>&gt;<i> AppleWorks was still greyed out even with the Show All Apps option, 
</I>&gt;<i> then there was a problem.
</I>
Yes, and the problem was the &quot;&quot; which I removed from the filename and 
all was fixed.

&lt;sigh&gt;
Can we close this thread now?
