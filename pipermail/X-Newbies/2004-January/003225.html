Nah, not a misunderstanding.  Just a difference of viewpoints.  People
underestimate the effort required to communicate with other people.
It's not easy being green!

Yep, you can still do this.

</I>
Again, that depends on your word processing tasks.  If you plan to KEEP
your documents to yourself, there's no need for you to buy M$ Office v.X
and you can check out other alternative apps.

If you plan to SHARE your documents with other people so that they can
EDIT them (assuming that many of these other people are Windoze users),
use of lots of M$ Office features, and avoid as much as possible any
compatibility problems with 3rd-party Word .doc reading/writing, then
you might have the valid need to buy M$ Office v.X.

Regarding other 3rd-party word processing apps, I have no idea how well
they read/write Word documents.  But I think it's more important to
first find out your needs, current and future.  Only after this step can
you look at what word processing apps that best fit your needs.
