My unscientific guess is that if you have an 800 MHz G3 or faster
processor and over 512 MB RAM, that's good enough for M$ Office 98.
Probably a non-issue.

:<i> &gt;2) Running M$ Office 98 in Classic is unstable and crashes often enough

</I>:<i> 
</I>:<i> Yep, and I suppose the only way to find out is to use it and see what

</I>
There might be information in Apple's or M$'s knowledge base.  But I've
seen few reports of M$ Office 98 crashing in Classic, probably just as
few as M$ Office crashing in OS 9.  Probably a non-issue.

:<i> &gt;3) You receive documents from newer versions of Office that cannot be
</I>:<i> &gt;read by M$ Office 98.
</I>:<i> 
</I>:<i> Hadn't thought of this, because I was assuming even new versions of 
</I>:<i> Office would have backward compatibility. Wishful thinking?
</I>
Yes, wishful thinking.  The term &quot;backward compatibility&quot; usually means
that a new thing can read/write to old things.  But it does not mean
that an old thing can read/write to new things.  It's true that newer
versions of M$ Office can save documents as older file formats.  However
I cannot guarantee for sure that an M$ Office v.X file can be opened by
an M$ Office 98 app.  It's the same problem with opening M$ Office XP
documents in M$ Office 98.

Now if you run into this problem, you can ask the sender to re-save the
document as an older file format.  This is an additional, inconvenient
task that can disrupt your work flow.

:<i> &gt;My suggestion (this will take some work) is to list all of your complex
</I>:<i> &gt;formatting requirements. [...]  And the work you've done will give you
</I>:<i> &gt;the hands-on experience you need to determine which app you prefer to
</I>:<i> &gt;use.
</I>:<i> 
</I>:<i> You are right, and I appreciate your help in defining a well-laid 
</I>:<i> out, scientific methodology.
</I>
Apologies if I get too scientific when I try to be thorough.  :-)
