<PRE>OS X Server is the server-version of OS X Client software. It features
special administrative tools to make it easier to adminster users,
privileges, sharing, web servers, etc.  It sells for $999 (unlimited
users, or $499 for 10 users) vs. $129 for Client.  OS X Server can run
on most Macs, including the G5, and you can read about it here:
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/">http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/</A> (the client software details are
here: <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">http://www.apple.com/macosx/</A>).

The PowerMac G5 in the grey &quot;cheese grater&quot; case is considered a desktop
(typical user) machine, but it would certainly make a reasonable server
if you were to install OS X Server software on it. However, you'd be
paying for features (lots of expansion slots, large box, powerful video
card) that you don't really need in a server machine.
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">http://www.apple.com/powermac/</A>

Apple's &quot;real&quot; servers are the Xserves, which have special features for
servers (some redundant parts, etc.), and are designed to fit in a rack
of equipment instead of on the desktop.  <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/xserve/">http://www.apple.com/xserve/</A>

You could, probably (?) install OS X Client on an Xserve, but it
wouldn't make a lot of sense to do so -- it's not necessarily a great
desktop machine, given the noise level and lack of slots for expansion
cards, etc.

Hope that helps a bit, and I've probably glossed some things over in an
attempt to provide a high-level overview.

Hello,

In the Mac lingo  is the G5 dual considered a
'Server' or is there actually different OSX
software for servers and 'regular' Macs as it
concerns OS X 10.3 or 10.3.2??
