I would say that's a bad idea unless you have an unusually good ISP.  
If you're getting broadband from a cable company or big telco, then I  
would advise against using them to walk you through anything on a  
Mac. You're almost certainly going to get incorrect advice. Its  
really very simple anyway, and you should learn how to do this basic  
network setup yourself - you open the network control panel and pick  
&quot;use DHCP&quot;. That's it. You're done.

On the PC, it is not unusual to redo settings that appear correct and  
have problems mysteriously go away, however I have never seen that on  
a Mac. It would be interesting to know what &quot;broadband&quot; setting on  
your iMac mysteriously became incorrect. In general use on a home  
broadband connection, you really shouldn't ever have to open the  
network control panel. If something strange is going on, I wouldn't  
start there, as you might on a PC. If you have someone in the family  
who likes to monkey around with those things, then you might need to  
start there  . . .
