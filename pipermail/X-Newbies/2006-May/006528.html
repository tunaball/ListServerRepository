<PRE>I have a PowerBook 1400/cs that I have retrieved most of my data from,
but would like to retrieve the rest. Here is the scenario:

1) The PB 1400 has a Global Village modem/ethernet PC card that has
problems with the drivers. I may or may not have the original drivers
on floppy that belong to the PC card as there were problems with
updating the drivers in OS 9.

2) The PB 1400 has a Zip drive (interchangeable with extra battery or
CD drive) and Zip drives work without a hitch.

3) I originally transferred the data I have at this time via Zip
drives to my PC (the motherboard having since wonked out, which is the
reason I am writing this e-mail on my G5 single).

4) I am using OS X 10.4.6 and have a Zip 250 drive connected to my G5,
but Zip disks won't mount (I have posted about this issue to the list
and have since found a number of comments from other Mac users on the
Net with this problem as well).

As far as I can see, the only alternative is to connect the Zip 250
drive to my daughter's IBM PC and then copy the data over to a USB
stick. Is this the general consensus? I do remember there used to be
some software made by an Italian out there that provided alternative
USB drivers for devices that didn't have Mac drivers, but I don't know
it this includes Zip drives or if the software still exists. I think
it was called USB Overdrive.

So here comes the last bit of this issue. I have a number of programs
on the PB 1400 that I was thinking of transferring to my G5 and
installing Classic on my extra internal SATA drive in my G5. I am not
sure how these programs would hold up when transferred first to a PC
and then to the G5 (here I am first and foremost thinking about the
resource forks.

Any ideas, advice?

Cheers,

Brian
</PRE>
