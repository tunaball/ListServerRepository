William,
Maybe sometimes the board is a preferable option, but many times it is not. Digital versions (computer or PlayStation etc) of old fashioned board games are often superior to the board version for various reasons (and I have 5 sons and so quite a bit of experience with these things)

(1)Easier to set up, no lost pieces.

(2)If online, can mean playing games and interacting even when physically separated by great distance.

(3) Rules are applied correctly and fairly. It is difficult for cheating to occur by selectively applying rules or inventing non standard rules as the game itself applies the rules without prejudice, so there are less arguments.

(4) Gameplay can be vastly better. Monopoly on Playstation for example is so much better than the old board game it is amazing.

(5) Graphics on a screen mean kids who would not wish to play on a dull old board will happily interact with one another by playing the same (but digital) game.

(6)More options are possible than just face to face contact (although my boys get very excited and noisy when playing the digital games face to face) Options such as being able to interact with one another via a game even when in separate (but networked) personal spaces.

On the other hand there is nothing more beautiful than playing any game in an analog version with a gorgeous woman in front of a fire in winter with Mozart and a good wine...  :-)
