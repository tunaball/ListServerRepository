Then yes, there's an issue with the administrator at juggler.com  
seeing .biz as spam. That's a stupid approach to handling spam, IMO,  
but that doesn't really matter. Every domain is used to originate  
spam. The question is not whether a domain is &quot;spammy&quot; (as if that  
meant anything) but whether you expect to get legitimate mail from  
that domain. Many people could dump some country-specific domains  
like .kr, but generally throwing out all mail from a domain is not a  
solution. You might try saying &quot;I'm not a spammer, and I have a .biz  
domain - what about that?&quot;.

But in any case, it's unlikely that you'll be able to talk the admin  
out of his current approach. If you want to send them email, send it  
from a yahoo or hotmail account - one of those domains that is so  
well known for being spam free.
