<PRE>Keith:

By the way, is AppleWorks the only application that is acting up?

If I had problems like this, I would do one of two things, maybe both.

One:  If fairly easy to do (which it would be in my case), I would back 
up all my Home files, reinitialize the hard drive, and install all 
software from scratch.

Two:  If rebuilding as above is not easy for you to do, I recommend 
going to the AppleWorks discussion forum at the Apple web site.  Also 
consider joining the AppleWorks User Group, now AUG or what used to be 
the CWUG.

If Two does not help, then resort to One regardless of how difficult it 
might be.

Sudden afterthought.  To make sure that your AppleWorks documents are 
okay, you might want to bring or send a sample or two to someone who 
could try to open them.  If they look normal, then that should ease 
some of your concern.  Try one that you have not opened since the 
troubles and another like your 53 page monster.
