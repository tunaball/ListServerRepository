I've had problems as well with firewire enclosures.
Had one go out recently.

Also had another problem.. which is a bit aggravating.
have a firewire enclosure that would not mount running OSX 10.2(what 
ever version was before 10.2.8
no matter what I did.

I updated to the first 10.2.8 upate.. and all of a sudden the firewire 
drive worked ( this was one of the claimed fixes in 10.2.8)   anyway.. 
after upgrading to the second 10.2.8 update, the drive no longer mounts 
again..

Panther is the first OSX update that I haven't been &quot;all over&quot;  usually 
I'm getting these updates the day they are released..  due to 
circumstances beyond my control :-)  I haven't bought panther yet. but 
hope to soon.. but all these reports about firewire drives going out 
have me bothered.. not to mention all the countless other bugs I'm 
hearing about..  but again, that's probably all i'm going to &quot;hear&quot; 
about.. don't hear to many &quot;works great for me&quot;  messages :-)
