First, thanks for answering Norm. It's the one with Jaguar and I'm 
using 10.2.6.
I do not use mac.com, but I manage about 50 domains/various ISP 
accounts (ELN is but one of them)  using Comcast.

&gt;<i> If you have Panther (10.3), you have the new iChat AV.
</I>
Yes I said I realized that on Panther the new iChat AV would be 
installed on it, so not worried about new machines I will get this 
coming year.........but I don't have it yet on the other machines that 
have Jaguar, and was considering getting it if the commercially 
available one was OK, depending on what any of you had to say about it.

&gt;<i>  You only need to separately purchase it if you are continuing to run 
</I>&gt;<i> Jaguar (10.2) and want the voice and video capability, since the beta 
</I>&gt;<i> for iChat AV is expiring soon.
</I>
Yes...I understand this, but my question was, did they fix all the bugs?

&gt;<i>  I haven't had any problems with muting or adding buddies with 
</I>&gt;<i> Panther's iChat AV.
</I>
Well, hopefully this will be so in the one you can buy.
The one I have now behaves bizarrely when I try to add a buddy that has 
IMed me out of the blue and won't work until I add it to the address 
book manually, and then add it.

Also, you can't talk but for more than 1minute and you have to use the 
MUTE button to clarify the voice which gets muzzy.
