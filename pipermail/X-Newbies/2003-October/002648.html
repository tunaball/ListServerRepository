</I>I had a number of rather bizarre behaviors with Jaguar mail from time 
to time. I have found that Panther mail hasn't been giving me the 
problems with difficulty connecting to my 7 or 8 e-mail accounts. I did 
have one problem with the CocoAspell service causing problems with 
Mail; however, once identified, Mail has run very, very well.

&gt;<i> Yes...I understand this, but my question was, did they fix all the 
</I>&gt;<i> bugs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Well, I don't know if ALL the bugs are fixed (in fact I think that 
unlikely), but I've noticed a significant improvement in audio and 
video quality. I have not noticed the sound becoming muffled, although 
I did have that problem with the iChat beta.
&gt;<i> Well, hopefully this will be so in the one you can buy.
</I>My understanding is that the one for sale is the same as the one 
available in Panther. You just get it for free as part of the upgrade.
&gt;<i> The one I have now behaves bizarrely when I try to add a buddy that 
</I>&gt;<i> has IMed me out of the blue and won't work until I add it to the 
</I>&gt;<i> address book manually, and then add it.
</I>I haven't had this happen so can't comment.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, you can't talk but for more than 1minute and you have to use the 
</I>&gt;<i> MUTE button to clarify the voice which gets muzzy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>See above.

Good luck with your decision making.
