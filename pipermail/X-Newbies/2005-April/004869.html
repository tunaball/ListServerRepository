&gt;<i>I had entrusted the upgrade of my system to a

Well, first, OS X is very touchy about RAM upgrades that don't meet 
Apple's specs precisely.  Also, any hardware upgrade, especially a 
processor upgrade, may cause the same sort of problem.  I think that you 
need to take your machine back to your technician and have him remove one 
and then the other, and see if things get better with either or both 
removed.  Both should have warranties.

Second, partitioning your hard drive, in my humble opinion, is something 
that should only be done by someone who both knows *why* they are doing 
it, and who understands how to do it and undo it.  I highly recommend 
against partitioning your hard drive if you don't know why it was even 
done.
See:

Item #12

Third, at this point you have moved system software around, and deleted 
some of it.  Generally that's a bad idea under OS X, and in any case it 
shouldn't be necessary.  You may have irreparably hosed your system.  

I fear that your &quot;expert&quot; is not as expert as one would hope.  What I 
recommend that you do is take your Mac back to him (you've already paid 
him, he should make your Mac work correctly), ask him to remove the new 
RAM, the new processor upgrade, backup your software, reformat your drive 
with one partition only, reinstall OS X, and then check to see if it is 
stable.  If it is, then he can add the RAM upgrade, and see if that is 
stable.  If it is he can add the processor upgrade, and see if that is 
stable.  He can then restore your software to your hard drive.

Good luck.
