<PRE>I had entrusted the upgrade of my system to a
professional who works with these machines more often
than I. He replaced my hard drive (mine was dead),
increased my RAM, and also upped my processor from a
G3 to a G4. He told me that I have a partition that
would be very touchy. (I really am not completely
clear on what this means.) When I got my machine back,
I noticed that I had (3) System Folders. One on my OS
X hard drive, and (2) others in another location named
Large Hard Drive (containing information from my dead
hard drive). When I contacted this professional about
the errors coming up on my screen, he said he didn't
know the root of the cause, but suspected that I have
duplicate conflicting documents, extensions and/or
plug-ins. He suggested that I delete the (2) other
System folders that I found on the &quot;large hard drive&quot;
and then research the errors that I was getting on the
internet. 

I opened all three of the System Folders and
transfered folders found in the Large Hard drive and
not found on the OS X hard drive to that folder. I
then deleted the (2) extra folders. I still have the
errors popping up, and no idea of how to fix them.

Should I reinstall OS X myself, how would I go about
it? I am afraid of my machine crashing yet again...it
has crashed since it's return from getting
repaired--all just from trying to install some needed
software that was lost from my old hard drive. I
needed to have the technician come back to boot from
his disk, and then do some minor adjustments. 

I'm trying to learn, but this newer system seems so
out of reach.
