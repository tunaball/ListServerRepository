Updating the prebinding information. In Apple's words:

    &quot;The Apple installer application performs an optimization step
     at the end of an installation. This optimization step looks at
     the applications on the boot partition and updates their
     prebinding information to match the current system
     configuration.&quot;

What is prebinding? Apple again:

    &quot;Prebinding is the process of computing the addresses for symbols
     imported by a framework or application prior to their use.
     Resolving these addresses before their use reduces the amount of
     work performed by the dyld tool at runtime and results in faster
     launch times for applications.&quot;

In a nutshell, on Mac OS X, prebinding makes applications launch faster.

Here's the long story, in severely simplified, non-techspeak language.  
Let's say John writes an application which, among other things, needs  
to calculate the square root of a number. So he writes a segment of  
code (a subroutine) which does this task. And let's say Peter writes  
another application, different from John's, but which also needs to  
calculate the square root. So Peter writes a subroutine to handle this  
task. This wastes resources -- for instance, if you run both apps at  
the same time, you use up memory twice loading two different  
subroutines which do the same thing. A better way of doing this is to  
put the subroutine which calculates the square root in a separate  
container (a reusable code library), supplied with the operating  
system. This way, neither John nor Peter have to waste their time  
writing a square root calculation routine; they just have to tell their  
applications to use the subroutine from the library; and when the  
applications are launched (executed) the library needs to be loaded in  
memory only once.

But what if the library contains, in addition to square root, many  
other functions? Then the application will have to be told where to  
find the square root in the library -- in other words, the square root  
function's address. But what if the library is changed, say, by  
replacing it with a new, improved version? Then the application will  
find the wrong code at the specified address, and it will crash or  
generate an error. A better way is to specify, instead of an address, a  
symbol, such as a name. So, instead of blindly executing code found at  
a particular address, the app will first look for the address  
corresponding to that symbol, and then execute it, thus making sure it  
executes the right code.

But what if there are many libraries, each with many functions? Every  
time an application launches, it will have to spend a lot of time  
matching subroutines and addresses -- in other words, binding a symbol  
to an address. But most of the time, this is not necessary, because  
libraries don't change that often. So the time it takes to launch an  
application can be shortened considerably by making a list of  
addresses, and using that predefined list, until one of the libraries  
changes. In other words, by prebinding. This is what the Apple  
installer does when it's &quot;optimizing system performance&quot;.

&gt;<i> So what is the need for applications like MOX that also &quot;pre-bind&quot; ?
</I>
Mostly, there isn't; at least, there hasn't been since 10.2. Of course,  
prebinding fails if the system configuration changes, and the Mac OS X  
installer optimization process itself has a number of limitations (e.g,  
it only prebinds applications on the boot volume). But the operating  
system detects when an application with outdated prebinding info is  
launched, and eventually it runs a faceless application called  
fix_prebinding, which attempts to fix that app's prebinding data, if  
possible. (Not all applications can be prebound.) So an application  
which fixes prebinding is useless for the overwhelming majority of  
users of Mac OS X v10.2 or later; the small number of users -- mostly  
developers -- who need it already know that the OS provides two tools  
for this purpose: redo_prebinding and update_prebinding.

Why would an application provide this function? Here's Tom Harrington's  
(developer of Macaroni) opinion:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.atomicbird.com/node/view/41">http://www.atomicbird.com/node/view/41</A>&gt;

For more on prebinding, here's a useful (IMHO, of course) link.

You'll find more info on Mac OS X maintenance and troubleshooting  
(including prebinding) here:

As for MOX Optimize, I'm not a fan at all. There are plenty of, IMHO,  
better applications for the job, such as
