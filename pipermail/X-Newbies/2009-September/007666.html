<PRE>I'm really glad this has been a valuable tool for you.

So this list is designed to be a place people new to Mac OS X can come  
and ask anything they want. More general discussions about Mac OS X  
would be more appropriate on the X4U list.

So the newbie part isn't saying everyone on the list is that way, just  
that those are the topics that are welcome and encouraged.

But hopefully like you've seen, everyone is kind and helpful.

Eric
