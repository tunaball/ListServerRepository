<PRE>&gt;<i>&quot;but I didn't *know* that top-posting vs. bottom-posting was even an 
</I>issue&quot;
Sometimes one doesn't know what he/she doesn't know, then can't ask the 
proper question.  You can't compare licking ketchup from the table with 
basic kowledge of netiquette.  I am new to posting and I did not 
understand (still don't) what top-posting means versus bottom 
posting...  Until this all discussion about &lt;Adios!&gt; I had no idea 
there was such a thing as netiquette.

Generosity and sharing seem to be what this list is all about.  So 
let's all be calm, understandig and friendly as Brian D. recommend.
Peace and love...

  There are some things that merit impatience. Its great to have 
unlimited patience about the list's subject material, but its not 
really helpful to be patient when it comes to the mechanics or 
moderation of the list.

 &gt; Flaming or threats of not helping newbies (and others)
 &gt; that do not follow the etiquette of some users are no more conducive
 &gt; to the purpose of the list than people that think bailing from the
 &gt; list is conducive to &quot;straightening out&quot; or &quot;punishing&quot; the list.

  On the contrary, it is *very* conducive to the purpose of the list for 
newbies to realize that they are asking help from another *person*, and 
the kind of response depends on how they ask. Its matters whether 
you're reasonably polite, can put together a coherent sentence, and can 
format your question in a legible way. The idea that you're less likely 
to get help if you top-post is not a threat, its simply a fact of life. 
It doesn't help newbies to leave them with the impression that civility 
is irrelevant, or that they can learn manners in a public place.

  At this point, the newbie usually says something like &quot;but I didn't 
*know* that top-posting vs. bottom-posting was even an issue&quot; (at 
least, the ones that haven't left). And this is exactly the point - its 
just basic politeness to assume some responsibility for getting basic 
info about how things work before you ask other people for their time. 
Impatience with things like posting HTML mail is exactly the kind of 
feedback the newbie needs. Its just like we would be impatient with 
someone who ate like an animal in a restaurant. You're supposed to 
learn some manners *before* you show up. It doesn't have to be perfect, 
but you ought to know things like not to be licking ketchup off the 
table, and you ought to know enough not to shout indignantly &quot;well, 
that's the way we do it at home!&quot; when other people stare.
