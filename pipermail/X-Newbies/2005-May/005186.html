</I>
Think about how well the &quot;1-800 numbers&quot;, &quot;mail order&quot;, &quot;dirt cheap&quot;, 
and &quot;VERY easy&quot; apply to users in less favoured nations. Even here, in 
Canada (NAFTA member), we sometimes have problems with 1-800 numbers 
(some work or are toll-free only in the US) and on-line dealers (some 
don't ship across the border). So, before offering a verdict of &quot;NO 
EXCUSE&quot;, you might wish to exercise a little patience, and take into 
account local circumstances.

&gt;<i> I regularly correspond with a couple of Mac users in Fiji (which is 
</I>&gt;<i> one of the more remote places for Mac users) and they have dealers 
</I>&gt;<i> (admittedly not in-country, but they can get what they need nearby).
</I>
I've worked in Eastern Europe and Central America. What I wrote was 
from first-hand experience. As to Fiji, that's interesting. Why don't 
you ask your correspondents about toll-free numbers, prices, shipping &amp; 
insurance costs, customs duties. If they find it &quot;VERY easy&quot;, then 
you're right to be harsh with them -- but keep in mind it's an 
exception (thanks to the Australian market), not the rule.

&gt;<i> I'm actually English
</I>
Congratulations. But -- your mail comes from a US address; you place in 
your .sig ads about a US MUG, a US periodical, and American rather than 
British politics. In most of your messages you use American rather than 
British spelling (&quot;marvelous&quot; rather than &quot;marvellous&quot;, &quot;proselytize&quot; 
rather than &quot;proselytise&quot;, &quot;gray&quot; rather than &quot;grey&quot;, etc.). Finally, 
some time ago, explaining one of your .sigs, you posted to this list

&gt;<i> [...] I simply encourage every American who gives even the
</I>&gt;<i> slightest damn about this country and its government [...]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [...] The biggest single problem in this country is [...] the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that not enough of us *participate* in the process. [...]
</I>
I don't see how you can &quot;participate in the process&quot; if you're not 
American. Speaking for myself, I should not like to presume to advise 
Americans (and certainly not in those terms) what their biggest single 
problem was, unless I were one of them.
