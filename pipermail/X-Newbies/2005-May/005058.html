This email is a perfect example of why top posting is annoying,
inefficient and impolite. If you cannot work out why, read my sig at the
end. Anyway, thanks - you've saved me the bother of pointing out for the
umpteenth time why top posting is bad. The email speaks for itself.

Regards,
 Jamie Kahn Genet

P.S. Boy do I feel sorry for anyone joining the conversation at this
point. Quoted text and replies top, bottom and all over.

P.P.S. Normally I would snip large portions of quoted text below, but
I'm leaving it this time to display how difficult it is to follow when
it's not in chronological order. Sorry.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; --  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my experience, business email ends to reply to longer writings and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more often is not distributed on a mailing list (where bottom posting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would convey the logical sequence of events to people who didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; write the originating email). More likely business email is a reply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to a person or a group of people, all of whom were aware of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contents of the original
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; email. In this case, it is not so terrible to show the reply first --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this way, people know what the original email was, and they are more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interested in seeing the reply.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On mailing lists, it can become very hard to determine what the heck
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is going on when top posting is used. This is for the reasons already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stated - that many people will read the email, but almost none of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them will know the contents of the email that is being replied to. So
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a logical flow of events makes things clear.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Outlook dominates the business world and is a defacto standard for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such writings. Most business people expect top posting and are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confused by bottom posting. Outlook does not take into account the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs of other users - for example, people who subscribe to mailing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lists. It is possible to bottom post in Outlook, but the vast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; majority of its users don't know how.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps a really good email program in the near future will be able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to examine quoting levels, then rearrange received emails according
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to one's preferences. And we'll never have to spend countless hours
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debating the issue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just call me a flexible top and bottom poster.
</I>-- 
A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
A: Top-posting aka TOFU (Top-post Over, Full quote Under)
Q: What is the most annoying thing on mailing lists?
