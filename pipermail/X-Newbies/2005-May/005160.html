<PRE>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-newbies.html">jamiekg at wizardling.geek.nz</A> (Jamie Kahn Genet)
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [X-Newbies] Re: Help! Total HD Meltdown
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Judging from the fact that you apparently can't be bothered to back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up your stuff, have no utilities and (thus) haven't done any system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maintenance, the fault here lies with you. Rather than attempting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blame others, you really should consider reforming your poor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computing habits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whoa, steady on there Tex. No need to bust this poor soul's chops.
</I>
The above came over rather differently than I intended. I was  
*trying* to bust his chops about being quick to blame others for his  
woes, but reading the above it sounds like I was busting his chops  
about not having a backup. Come to think of it, I think I meant to do  
both.

&lt;mini-rant&gt;
I *do* feel badly for the OP, but *come on* -- hard drives are dirt  
cheap, cloning tools are available as *donationware,* and once you've  
cloned the HD one time (which admittedly takes a while) the periodic  
backups are very quick. There is NO EXCUSE for people who, after 20+  
years of being warned to make backups, fail to have a backup.

Just a couple of weeks ago, a shelf on the desk above me collapsed  
(too much junk!) and knocked over my external HD *just as I was  
writing to it.* Oh dear. And yes, when I frantically set it back up  
and turned it on, I could tell in seconds that the hard drive was  
completely toasted.

After about 10 seconds of cussing, I reached over to my backup HD,  
plugged it in and rebooted. I lost a grand total of about 10 emails.  
I was down for maybe ten minutes, and only that long because I felt  
like berating myself for having overloaded the shelf in the first place.

Everyone -- even the gurus -- need backups. People who keep anything  
of real value on their computer need backups even MORE. Don't be  
fools. *MAKE BACKUPS.*
&lt;/rant&gt;

&gt;<i> Apple even provides their own utility called Backup (how original)  
</I>&gt;<i> as a
</I>&gt;<i> download from the .Mac site.
</I>
This only works with .Mac accounts, but it's not bad, particularly  
when used to back up small but important files to your iDisk. In  
addition to a regular backup, really vital stuff (like passwords)  
need to be backed up to an OFF-SITE location (in case your house  
burns down or something, Bob forbid).

&gt;<i> Yup - this user definitely needs to upgrade to Panther (10.3) or Tiger
</I>&gt;<i> (10.4).
</I>
And again, it comically inexpensive to do so compared to be benefits  
gained from doing so. On dealmac.com I routinely see specials on  
Panther from people like Megamacs.com et al for around $60 or so.

I just don't get why so many Mac owners are so hesitant to invest in  
their machines. They already enjoy a HUGE cost savings over their PC- 
using friends by not having to replace their machines nearly as  
often, not to mention all the cash they're not spending on anti-virus/ 
spyware/hackers, no long-distance forever-on-hold calls to techs and  
companies who only blame each other, no weekly visits from $80/hour  
(and up) PC techs and so on.

Dust off that wallet and make a few small, smart investments in that  
Mac and believe me you'll get more out of it for far longer than if  
you don't.
