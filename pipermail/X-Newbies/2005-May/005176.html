It seems to me our American friends sometimes forget to consider that 
things don't always work in the rest of the world as they do in the US.

The OP came from an address in Indonesia. I don't know what the Mac 
situation is in Indonesia, but, from my experience, outside the &quot;first 
world&quot;, and especially outside North America, with a few exceptions, 
Macs represent an even smaller segment of the market. Mac dealers are 
few and far between; moreover, although, on average, people earn less 
(sometimes a great deal less), computing equipment in general is more 
expensive.

Ordering computer equipment from abroad is not always a realistic 
option -- adding shipping costs and customs duties can sometimes 
effectively double the expense. Even when it is, a lot of people in 
those countries do not have credit cards; and, even when they do, many 
online retailers do not accept credit card payments from certain 
countries, because of the high level of credit card fraud there.

So, all-in-all, have little more patience with Mac users who happen to 
live in less privileged areas.
