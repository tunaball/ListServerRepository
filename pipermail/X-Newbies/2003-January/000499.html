&gt;<i>Apple really dropped the ball on this one. How they could release a 
</I>&gt;<i>new OS that required a firmware update and not have the installer 
</I>&gt;<i>automatically check for and if necessary install that update is 
</I>&gt;<i>beyond me.
</I>
A lot of things are happening like this. Seems like we are quite spoiled 
by the past. I wonder if the OS is that complicated or if they are just 
in a darn hurry to put this stuff out and forget the details? This is 
what I love about the &quot;Mac&quot;, the attention to detail.
This is more typical of something that might happen on a PC it seems.

I recently spoke to a convert for whom I set up a new iMac (the gumdrop 
kind.) She is using OS 9.2.1 and I set up everything and added everything 
I thought she might need. I gave her the typical newbie setup, Documents 
folder and Launcher, and told her to stay away from the HD, etc. I gave 
her minimal instructions and set up the web............ 

For about 3 weeks I did not hear a peep. I called and asked if she needed 
any help and she remarked that after years of grappling with PCs, working 
with the Mac was like working with &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; that told 
you exactly what you did wrong and how to fix it. She was not only amazed 
but pleased at how intutitive the experience was and noticed how each 
command related to every application! (She is a very smart woman, smarter 
than my normal customers)

Her whole reason for doing this was, she felt if she put the internet on 
her business PCs she might screw them up royally and wanted an 
alternative machine to go online with and accepted my offer to find and 
set up for her a leftover iMac G3.
She commented, &quot;It's simply flawless and will not let you screw up&quot;...

Hehehe.
