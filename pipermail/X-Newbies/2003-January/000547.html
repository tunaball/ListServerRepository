<PRE>So glad to hear this Brian,

As a public school teacher in a school filled with PC's, I am envious, 
but glad to see someone adopting the Mac and not abandoning it.  We 
have 3 desktops connected to the internet in every classroom, 5 labs, 
and each teacher has a laptop.  But 2 full time in house techs can't 
keep these machines all up and running.  Between the cheap hardwarre, 
slow processors and limited memory, archiac operating system, and 
blocking software installed on all the desktops, you just can't count 
on them for instruction.

Oh how I wish they were Macs.  Interestingly, middle and elementary 
schools have macs.
