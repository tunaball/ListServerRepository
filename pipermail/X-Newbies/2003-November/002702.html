On Wednesday, November 12, 2003, at 06:02  AM, Many Mac OS X Newbies 
wrote a lot!:

WOW! Where does one begin to respond to all the replies? Thanks to 
everyone for their input. Enough said about Norton products: They work, 
they do a good job, but DON'T load Norton apps onto your hard drive(s).

I do need to do be a good citizen and make sure that files I receive 
and then pass on to others are not infected with a virus, hence the 
need for OSX &quot;virus-protection.&quot;

Dare I admit to you all, that I don't have a second hard drive to use 
for backup purposes. Hey, I'm a preschool teacher! With my &quot;salary,&quot; 
food, shelter and medical costs come first, then computer needs, then 
the wife and kid. I backup mission critical files to CDR. A 160 GB 
EZQuest Cobra HD at 208.00 is on the list for the next go-around of 
computer expenditures.

I have been told that optimizing a drive (with OSX on it) with the OS9 
version of Norton is not a good thing. True? Hence the need for a OSX 
version. I've read in several places that OSX (10.2.8 and earlier), is 
a nasty OS for fragmenting a drive. I am at the point where I can't 
install large apps like Photoshop 7 or InDesign - they crap out in the 
middle of the install process, saying they can't finish the install 
because there isn't enough room, yet I have 4 gigs of room left!

Drive 10 is seventy bucks and doesn't include virus protection. Norton 
SystemWorks 3.0 for Mac is 80.00 (with a fifty dollar rebate factored 
in). I hate counting beans, but I don't have the luxury of a large 
war-bank.

Thanks again for your input!

Paul

Pismo 256ram 10.2.8 (6R73)
