I'm wondering why this system has so many problems when I turned off 
the firewall in every place I could. Is there one running I don't know 
about that can't be turned off?

&gt;<i> a)  If you're using OS X, yes you do have a firewall, whether you're

</I>
Why be so nasty about it? I am using all sorts of systems.....including 
X which is the only one giving me fits....and it scares me because all 
my data is on here now. Geesh. Have a heart.

&gt;<i> b)  The gist of the post you're responding to is that a firewall 
</I>&gt;<i> configuration is not likely to be the problem, so stating that you 
</I>&gt;<i> have no firewall, however incorrectly, isn't very responsive.
</I>
I didn't think it had to do with it but just thought I would mention 
that it is turned OFF.
I log into here from elsewhere.

&gt;<i> c)  The suggestion given was to attempt connection to the POP server 
</I>&gt;<i> via telnet, to isolate the problem as being within or without 
</I>&gt;<i> Mail.app.  Did you do this?  If so, what was the result?  If not, go 
</I>&gt;<i> do it and forebear posting on this topic until you can report the 
</I>&gt;<i> result.
</I>
I don't know how to use Telnet on this. I used it on System 7.5.3 last 
time. I have not used it here. Send instructions. How would this show 
me why certain accounts sometimes have that port 110 message? I don't 
understand it at all.
