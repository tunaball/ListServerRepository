Your ISP's tech support may be asking you to add certain AT commands
that tell the modem to reset itself to the factory default settings.

</I>
It sounds like your Mac dealer doesn't want to deal with OS X 10.1.
And unfortunately, that's not unreasonable.  But there may be other
ways to directly interface with the modem.  I suggest ZTerm.

</I>
This is actually very possible.  Older phone equipment do not provide
proper shielding from the elements, or the shielding has worn down over
time, or both.

Download ZTerm and have it ready so that you (or your Mac dealer or your
ISP tech support) enter AT commands directly into the modem.  But what I
first suggest is to bring your eMac to your Mac dealer and ask if you
can dial out from his phone lines (assuming he is okay with it and his
phone lines are working fine).  If you can establish a reliable dial-up
connection, then it's the phone lines at your home that's busted --- in
which case you call up your local phone provider and have them run a
diagostic.  Better yet, if you hear static on your phone line now where
you did not anything before the storms, definitely call up your local
phone provider and tell them you hear static.  They will have to send a
technician over to troubleshoot.

Good luck!
