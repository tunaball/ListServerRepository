This is good to know. Recently my state was declared a federal  
disaster area because of a prolonged power outage.

Even though I had a generator to keep me warm, the cable was out for  
a very long time. I had to revert to dialup, just to get email so I  
could update important happenings and event cancellations at the very  
least as I manage a huge calendar.

The most I got from my Titanium/500's modem was 28.8, while working  
off battery power. I had not tried my Powerbook G4 but it seems to  
have a modem as well.

Holy Cow. I hadn't had that slow a connection since 1996!
