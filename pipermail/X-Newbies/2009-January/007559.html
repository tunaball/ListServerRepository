Older post, so I'll keep it as brief as possible.

1. This list is NOT private.  It is quite public.  The registration
process exists to enforce the policy that only list members may post.
However, anyone and everyone can read, including non-list members.
So posts are quite public.

2. All posts are physically stored on the themacintoshguy.com web site.
Since the list owner gave permission, all posts are also indexed by
Google.  So all posts are quite public and quite searchable.

3. Although you have real concerns about identity theft, the bad guys
need more information than your name and email address.  They prefer
things like postal addresses, phone numbers, credit card info, social
security numbers, and other useful pieces of information.
