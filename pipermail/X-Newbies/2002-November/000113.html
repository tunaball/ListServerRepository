Yup.

</I>
Not exactly.  VM is there when there's not enough RAM to do work.  You
consume lots of VM only if you do so many things that there's not enough
RAM to keep it all in memory.

Of course, bugs from bad programming and memory leaks may eat more RAM,
and therefore more VM, than normal.

</I>
Actually, &quot;reuse&quot; isn't the right term.  OS X actually deletes unneeded
swapfiles and creates new swapfiles as needed.  If swapfiles are there,
they are simply &quot;in use&quot;.

:<i> So the

</I>
If a quick logging out/in doesn't work, unfortunately a reboot is still
in order.  Oh well, at least it's not as bad as old Mac OS when you had
to reboot almost daily and worry about extension conflicts.  :-)

</I>
The MacJanitor stuff isn't so effective because all it does is run all
those cron jobs, which do nothing regarding the care and feeding of
swapfiles.
