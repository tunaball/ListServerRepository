<PRE>I am wondering if you were using Quark because you were doing professional
level creative work?

If that's where your interest is heading again, go talk to a professional
print shop. Find out what app's are used most in their pipeline. I know some
who won't accept anything but Quark files, some accept EVERYTHING - even
Corel work!

I would suggest Photoshop and InDesign over anything else, but budgets
always dictate alternative options. Check out Photoshop Elements as an
alternative to Photoshop and maybe consider Adobe's PageMaker for layout.

Just beware of any app's that advertise that they 'do it all'. They never
do.
