<PRE>Ian Sights said:

&gt;<i>Does any OS other than X check the Ownership and Permissions of a file? 
</I>&gt;<i>I emailed a file to a printer and they forwarded it to the people 
</I>&gt;<i>actually making the pens and I got the message back that the file was 
</I>&gt;<i>read only. I resent it, making sure that the Group and Others were set 
</I>&gt;<i>to read &amp; write and they still had trouble. I don't think they are on 
</I>&gt;<i>X, but since I was getting a passed along message, I don't really know.
</I>&gt;<i>What really puzzles me is that the copy that I CC:d to myself changed 
</I>&gt;<i>from Read &amp; Write for everybody to read only for everyone but me. Why? 
</I>&gt;<i>Did I not change it like I thought? (The original file info still reads 
</I>&gt;<i>read &amp; write.) Does it get set to read only for others since I'm the 
</I>&gt;<i>user who downloaded it?
</I>&gt;<i>Obviously if there's a settings problem I need to figure it out or 
</I>&gt;<i>vendors will get really PO'd at me. I ended up resending the file from 
</I>&gt;<i>an OS 9 machine after resaving it with Illustrator 8 just to be sure. 
</I>&gt;<i>Obviously this is not a good solution long term.
</I>

What sort of file did you send them?  Was it a file that you saved as a 
PDF?  PDF (portable document format) is a universal format that allows 
anyone to read or print the file, but these files are really not made to 
be edited.  (It's minimally possible using the full commerical version of 
Acrobat, but that's not what PDF's are designed for.)

Claiming that the Macintosh is inferior to Windows because most people 
use Windows, is like saying that all other restaurants serve food that is 
inferior to McDonalds'.
