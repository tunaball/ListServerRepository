Whew, let me see......I believe Florin  and others others have made 
suggestions on how to get this working but not sure if you tried them 
and if they worked.

I usually just PURCHASE a CD that is proper for the hardware I am 
trying to get working. In the case of all G3's I re-do a nice White and 
Orange universal install CD of 9.1 is what I use.
However, if you insist on using X too, you can buy X on eBay for 
cheaper than you can OS 9 alone. There are many packages of 10.2.4 plus 
9.2.1 floating around that people got free and are selling for $50.

Splurge!  :-)

As for the fact that some machines might need some helper app to get X 
to run on them, you would be on your own with that. I only install X on 
supported machines because usually the user is not happy with the lack 
of speed that results. (I don't remember if you said yours was 
unsupported or not..so if that doesn't apply, just ignore, don't jump 
down my throat...I've read at least 1,000 message since your last 
one....)

YMMV of course, but I am just telling you what I do.
