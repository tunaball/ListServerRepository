<PRE>well i got hold of a couple of os 9 CDs

one of them is 9.1
when i tried to install from it, it told that it was already installed.
and that if i wanted to install 9.2 to slip the disk in etc..

so, i insert  the other CD (os 9.2.1) and double click the update OS i 
get the following message
&quot;Classic startup found no system folder on the boot volume from which 
to start Classic. &quot; then it tells me that i can open classic 
preferences and search for available folders, if i try that, i get 
three options all grayed over so that i cannot select any of them (they 
are G3, MS office X, and Mac OS 9.2.1. Update)....

just for kicks i tried to start Classic from the start button here.  
the icon appears ion the dock, the classic desktop window begins to 
start running the blue meter  begins moving to the right and nevver 
gets there, sometimes it gets close, but never actually opens, just at 
the crux it flashes a box which says &quot;Kodac, color processor version&quot; 
but this closes immediately and then the os9 icon disappears and i'm 
back where i started.

i wondered whether classic will not  start because (as i understood it) 
classic = os 9.2 not the 9.1 i have installed here.

the first step of florin's advice was to reinstall the OS X.  ... i am 
doing that now, although i don't suspect  that it will fix the classic 
problem.
