<PRE>Hi J

a few answers to your questions

&gt;<i> __AOL, which my significant other uses (i tease her about it tho) 
</I>&gt;<i> won't run right and she has been on the ohone with their tech support 
</I>&gt;<i> people for hours and hours.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have the latest version of AOL for X?
</I>
yes.



&gt;&gt;<i> __Applications moved from iMac to G3 are *very* buggy and throw up 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lots of warnings telling me of missing folders and missing this or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that or that things i have never heard  of will not be available 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (photoshop is the worst for this).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you reinstall those from original disks?
</I>
no. that was *why* i wanted to know if they could be transfered from 
one machine to another, i do not have original disks...  being told 
that it would work with a firewire cable i tried it


&gt;&gt;<i> i feel like i need to start over. from the beginning. but i don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know where that is exactly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wipe it and install 9 then 10 again. What version of 10? I wouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> recommend anything before 10.2.4
</I>
the iMac is 10.2.  i have tried maybe 8 or 9 times to download the 
update for the OS from the mac site but it never gets here before 
something burps on the line and disconnects. (i have dial-up natch)

so, here is where i get very nervous..

i have the disks that came with the iMac but nothing with the G3.
the iMac's disks are
__Apple Hardware Test (no idea what it  is for)
__Mac OS X install disks 1 &amp; 2
__iMac software restore in 5 #ed disks (not sure what  software this is)
__World Book Mac OS X edition


... so when i read the things below various questions come to me

&gt;<i> Wipe it and install 9 then 10 again.
</I>
1. how do i wipe the machine?  do i just grab everything in the hard 
drive and drag to trash? perhaps there is more in for here;

&gt;<i> Using OS 9 disk start up with it and use Drive Setup to wipe the drive 
</I>&gt;<i> then install 9.
</I>
2. but i don't know which of the discs i got with the iMac to use... 
none of them say &quot;OX 9&quot;

&gt;<i> Update to 9.2.2 if you're going to put X on there.
</I>&gt;<i> Use the Update Control Panel to get the rest of the pieces.
</I>
3. the rest of what pieces?

&gt;<i> Then install X, simple as that.
</I>
4. simple huh?  doesn't sound simple to me, sounds like something i 
could screw up amazingly well.

thanks for your suggestions.

</PRE>
