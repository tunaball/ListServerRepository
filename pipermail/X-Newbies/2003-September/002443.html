LOL Clive, sorry if I upset you, but, the 'experts' have said it and so 
if it's good enough for them I guess it's good enough for me.

There are just some things on X that defy all explanation.
These crash reports are a perfect example.

I do know that in 9 when I got that kind of error, it was a rare 
hardware problem, and it was fixed.
Since this fellow's machine is just out of the box, I have no idea what 
could be wrong. A transient error? Something to do with slow dialup 
speeds? Even on OS 9, things like AOL 5 and Netscape 4.8 work perfectly 
for me due to having a well-maintained machine and &quot;one of the best 
connection speeds in the country&quot; according to all tests. Some web apps 
don't seem to like slow dialup speeds and seem to behave worse.

&gt;<i> Like moving to Entourage and NOT being able to import messages from

</I>&gt;<i> workaround by looking-up manually.
</I>
Well, if it's not written into the software, it's as you say, simply 
not an option. At least you know why....


&gt;<i>  But if even the 'experts' are frustrated - hey, I'm in good company!
</I>
Well said. There are limits to what control we have over some things. 
If there is a solution to this problem of apps crashing for no apparent 
reason, I'd be glad to hear it.

As for his application, I already sent him a complete list of the files 
to trash since I know it well. After that I have no answers.
Mine has done this and I've just ignored it.
