Yeah - that's why I want to get them off AOL. It seemed like the  
&quot;easy&quot; way at first, but the client program gets in the middle of  
everything and really spoils the whole user interface for the novice  
user. It owns every download, image, contact, etc. and its not clear  
to the novice when things are on and off the server. They don't know  
enough of the technical details to manage the creators to stop all that.

Just having to use their special program to dial up wouldn't be so  
bad, but I wonder if its going to insinuate itself onto the system by  
owning files. Or worse yet, if you have to use their browser and  
email, and get ads?

Their web site implies its PC only.

</I>
Unfortunately, they're out in the boonies - no cable, no DSL. There's  
even a wireless provider in the area called Clearwire, but its outer  
limit is still several miles away.
