I haven't read the entire thread that led up to this post.  However, as 
far as I can tell, you are having a problem with the permissions on a 
large number of files on your hard drive.

Repair Permissions in Disk Utility can only set the proper permissions 
for *Apple Software*.  It doesn't touch third party software or files.

Up until OS X 10.3.something, you had to use the version of Disk Utility 
on your hard drive to repair permissions, because there were receipt 
files for subsequently installed software on the hard drive that wouldn't 
be read by the version of DU on your CD-ROM.  As of about 10.3.2, 
according to Dan Frakes, Apple made it so that if you run Disk Utility 
from the installer CD-ROM, receipts on your hard drive are read, and 
permissions are set correctly. (I've never received confirmation of this 
from anyone else.)

However, unless there is a good reason for doing so otherwise, I would 
still run Disk Utility/Repair Permissions from the copy on your hard 
drive.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a uRL link available and handy for a list of whatever/all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the OSX System needs to have it's permissions set to for use??
</I>&gt;<i>Am still hoping for a point to for the above, there's just got to 
</I>&gt;<i>be one out there somewhere, right?
</I>
No, there is no such list.  Repair Permissions knows what to set 
everything to for the OS, and that should be good enough for the OS.

Generally, if you have somehow gotten screwed up permissions for third 
party software and files, they won't open or run correctly.  If you need 
to fix the permissions all that you need to do is make sure that you are 
the owner of your own programs and files and that you have read/write 
privileges.  If you need to fix a lot of files at the same time, check 
out this free utility:
