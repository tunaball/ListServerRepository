<PRE>My college age son called me tonight frustrated because his iBook 
(running Tiger - not sure what version) doesn't want to connect to the 
internet now. It worked earlier in the evening, but not now. When he 
goes to the networking  location in his system preferences he gets this 
message: Your cable for internet is connected but your computer does 
not have an IP address and could not connect to the internet. I had him 
try to restart and he got the following message: 10.1.101.28 in use by 
00:08:a1:16:9e:55, dhcp server 10.1.0.222.

Here's what he's tried:
1. Switching connection locations. His roommate's computer connects to 
the internet, so my son tried plugging into the wall port that his 
roommate was using. Didn't make any difference.
2. I also had him run disk permissions - from the hard drive, not from 
his original disks. (His original disks are here at home, not with 
him.) Didn't help.
3. Had him try to set up a new location from within the Network area of 
System Preferences. Didn't help.

Any other ideas? Any other information you need about his setup. Thanks 
in advance for your help.
