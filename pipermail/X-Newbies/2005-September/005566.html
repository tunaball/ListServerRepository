For Immediate Release
 
Surf the Internet on Your Favorite Mac for Even Less With FasterMac.net
 
56K dial-up as low $5 per month and DSL as low as $27.99 per month
 
WOODSTOCK, Ill. (September 22, 2005) - FasterMac.net, a division of Other
World Computing, has been providing fast, reliable, nationwide Internet
service to Mac owners since 2003. Thanks to significant subscriber growth
and prevailing market conditions, we are pleased to make this service an
even better value. 
 
The Internet options FasterMac customers have are:
 
&#128; Unlimited, nationwide local 56K dial-up as low as $5 per month
&#128; The same 56K dial-up with TurboMac Acceleration, for surfing up to six
times faster, as low as $7.41 per month
&#128; Nationwide DSL Broadband as low as $27.99 per month
 
&#179;Internet access is practically a necessity today. But that doesn&#185;t mean
reliable and full-featured access needs to be expensive. That&#185;s especially
the case for Mac owners who, thanks to Apple&#185;s excellent operating system,
are also the least difficult to support,&#178; said Larry O&#185;Connor, president 
of
OWC. &#179;While other services have significantly higher rates due in part to
the higher expense of dealing with Windows users, FasterMac.net is able to
provide premium Internet services with all the savings.&#178;
 
Each dial-up and DSL FasterMac.net account includes/features:
 
 &#128;    5 @fastermac.net e-mail addresses
 &#128;    Powerful and user customizable anti-spam tools
 &#128;    Virus blocking
&#128;    Five RSS feeds for blogging and podcasting
 &#128;    50 megabytes of personal Web space
 &#128;    Digital connections up to 56K
&#128;    Local dial-up numbers in all 50 states
&#128;    Unlimited, un-timed access
&#128;    Toll-free technical support
 
 
Upgrading to TurboMac also adds popup blocker and surfing speeds up to six
times that of standard dial-up connections. DSL accounts require a 
one-year
contract and installation fees that start at $99. There is no installation
fee or contract term for 56K dial-up accounts.

to
get full details on pricing, plans and support.
