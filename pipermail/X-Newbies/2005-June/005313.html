I'll tell you a couple different ways I deal with mounting servers.  
Maybe one will work for you.

First, mount them like you usually do. If you then look in ~/Library/ 
Recent Servers, you'll see a file that was created. Opening that file  
any time will mount the drive, but it does throw up the login prompt  
for user &amp; password. There are a couple things you can do with this  
&quot;file&quot;. You can rename it and put it somewhere else (I have a folder  
called &quot;My Servers&quot;). From there, you can select it as a startup  
item, so it will mount the share when logging in (with user/ 
password). You can also put that file anywhere else that's convenient.

Note: Just took a look, and while ~/Library/Recent Servers is present  
in Panther, I'm not seeing it in Tiger. Did it move somewhere else  
that I can't find, or is it gone?

The other method I use is to, again, mount the drive with the folder 
(s) I want to have mounted. Then drag the folder I'm most interested  
in into the Sidebar of a Finder window. The nice thing about this  
method, is it remembers user/password if you told it to while  
connecting. So all I need to do is click on that folder at any time  
and it automatically mounts and shows me what's there (just takes a  
couple extra seconds if the drive isn't already mounted). You can  
also rename the folder in the sidebar (hold down the control button  
while clicking on it). I haven't tried putting the target folder in  
the Dock to see if that works, but I assume it would.

This is all done using the client version of OS X. I would think the  
Server version would have more options, but I can't help you there.
