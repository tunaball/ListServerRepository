They're probably not lost, just the finder lost track of where the
Aliases point to.

1. Try running disk utility from the installer CD and let it check
the drive.
2. Do a search for the missing file or folder names (Cmd-F) and see
where it takes you.

As for Entourage have you compacted the databases yet?
Hold Option key on launch to bring up the dialog box.
