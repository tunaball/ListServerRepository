As it happens, I have dual citizenship. But I'm proud of my country of 
adoption, as well as my country of birth. Had I the honour of being a 
citizen of the US, as well as a citizen of the UK, it should never have 
occurred to me to reply to &quot;our American friends sometimes forget&quot; with 
&quot;I'm actually English&quot;. Chacun a son gout, I guess.

&gt;<i> Oh come on now. You're getting silly.
</I>
Perhaps. Whatever I'm getting, the point is simple. Mac users living 
outside privileged areas may find it neither &quot;VERY easy&quot; nor &quot;dirt 
cheap&quot; to purchase the wherewithal for regular backups. Therefore, 
before busting the chops of a Machead who posts a plea for help with a 
crashed disk, take a moment to consider where he's posting from. Before 
telling him that

&gt;&gt;<i> There is NO EXCUSE for people who, after 20+ years of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being warned to make backups, fail to have a backup
</I>
ask yourself whether he might not have a reasonable excuse. He may know 
as well as you do -- who knows, perhaps even better than you do -- how 
important a backup is. But, in his neck of the woods, just owning a Mac 
and being on-line may be more than most of his compatriots could 
afford.

&gt;<i> you may wish to look into reading-comprehension classes
</I>
Thanks, I'll take that under advisement. At any rate, I find flame wars 
boring, so I guess I'll ignore the rest.
