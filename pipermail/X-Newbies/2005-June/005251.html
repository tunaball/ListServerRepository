For the past 5 years we have been really lucky.  Even if there is an OS 
X-specific virus released today, it will be the first.  The next Windows 
virus released will be one of *over 100,000*!:

&gt;<i>I, now completely Anti-Virus free, am thinking that if I have an A-V
</I>&gt;<i>program, that I will be better off in the event of a newly released virus
</I>&gt;<i>due to the (hopefully) rapid release of a security patch by the service I
</I>&gt;<i>subscribe to. Is there any real logic in that thinking?
</I>
That is the thinking of many folks.  

Others will argue that there haven't been any OS X viruses released 
during the past 5 years, and that there is no reason to believe that one 
will be released in the next 5 years.

You will probably have to make up your own mind where you think the 
situation is headed.  I run anti-virus software, but I use my computer 
for my business, so I'm not willing to chance even the smallest 
possibility of being infected by malware.

&gt;<i>Also during my year of Norton A-V it quarantined about a dozen suspicious
</I>&gt;<i>files. Which I deleted. Are you suggesting that this apparently successful
</I>&gt;<i>work by the program was little more than window dressing? That those files
</I>&gt;<i>would have done no harm anyway because they were likely Windows based items?
</I>
That is quite possible.  Or they could have been files infected with 
Office macro viruses.  

I am running Virus Barrier, and I've been using it for about 4 years.  In 
all that time it has only ever flagged one thing, and that was a Windows 
virus.

I used Virex under OS 7, 8, and 9, over the span of many years.  The only 
virus that I recall it ever detecting was during the initial run, and 
even then all that it detected was the inert fragment of a virus.

In the DealMac forums is a discussion entitled: &quot;Have you ever caught a 
Mac Virus?&quot;  You might like to read the comments.
