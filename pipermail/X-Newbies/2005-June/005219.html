<PRE>Yesterday I posted a question called &quot;missing files after Panther upgrade&quot;.
Some one replied but the Entourage problem destroyed his reply so I can't
refer to it nor ask for more info.

Entourage first. It has become super sensitive to the delete key, also the
space bar. Yesterdays reply asked me if I had &quot;....&quot; the data yet. I was in
the process of replying with &quot;Whazzat?&quot; when my reply and his posted reply
were both deleted together. I w2as trying to delete highlighted text and
html for bottom posting (yeah, I listened in the great bottom posting debate
Jamie) when I hit delete everything disappeared including his reply.

It has happened to several messages overnight. Also hitting the space bar
jumps me forward several messages. Oh, for an undo option in Entourage!

Someone had suggested something to try that I am unfamiliar with. Anyone (or
he,) know what he was talking about, and any other suggestions please.

BTW. My original question had been about 3 missing files (backups for stuff
on the web) I still can't find those files. I have been able to recover a
substantial portion via backups of the backup, but would still like to know
is it feasible to recover files from the websites without disturbing the
operation of those sites.

Can't just use installer disc as was suggested as since putting on Open
Firmware password have been unable to boot from other discs such as Disc
Utility.

Thanx,Tony

</PRE>
