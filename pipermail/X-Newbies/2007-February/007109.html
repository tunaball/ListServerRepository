<PRE>Hi

I'm having problem connecting to the internet.   I use Comcast and this 
morning they came by and hooked up a new modem - they said my other one 
was outdated.

I have a G4 running OS 9.1 and a Ti-Laptop running 10.3.9.   I have my 
tower set up as a AirPort Base Station.   I do most of my work on my 
laptop.

The minute he walked into the room he said he hated Macs, so I was 
afraid there might be trouble.  And there was, after he hooked up the 
modem he couldn't get the tower to connect up.   He said they didn't 
support OS 9 and I would have to call Apple and left.    I called 
Comcast directly and while the guy didn't know Macs, said they did 
support OS 9.  He thought maybe the AirPort Base Station was my 
problem.   He asked if I could reset the AirPort card.

If I connect the laptop up to the modem it works fine.   But I'd really 
like to get the tower hooked up and back running as the base station 
and use my laptop wirelessly.

Does anyone know if you can reset a Airport Card or if that even sounds 
like that could be the problem?


Thanks to anyone who has an idea.
Pam
