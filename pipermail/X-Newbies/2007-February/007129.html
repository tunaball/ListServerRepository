<PRE>Thanks for the info. Reading the documentation that comes with an app
rarely covers a large issue like OS X network/internet security in
it's entirety. FWIW, I did read the documentation, as well as checked
related issues on the developer's site forum. As far as WeatherDock
was concerned, I considered it a no-brainer as well and was therefore
surprised when I found that the setting had already been preconfigured
by the developer. Since starting to use OS X, I have become
increasingly concerned about issue #1. This comes from a mixture of
not really understanding OS X security and having tested a fair amount
of program demos lately. Purchasing Little Snitch and asking about
port 80 were an attempt to learn a little bit more about OS X
security.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have just purchased LittleSnitch in an attempt to improve the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; security on my G5 running Tiger 10.4.8. I have noticed that It tries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to block apps that want to access the Internet by way of something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; called &quot;port 80&quot;. Some of the apps that have been caught doing this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are Firefox, WeatherDock and Google Notifier, but on the other hand,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; LS is configured to allow apps like the QuickTime player to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access &quot;port 80&quot;. Why the difference between apps and why is it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important to block &quot;port 80&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mean to sound condescending, but you really need to better
</I>&gt;<i> understand what Little Snitch does in order to use it effectively. It
</I>&gt;<i> comes with a help file: read it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A *lot* of programs have a need to communicate outside your machine.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes it is a simple check for updates (which is what Firefox is
</I>&gt;<i> doing); sometimes it is the inherent nature of the program (how do
</I>&gt;<i> you expect WeatherDock to update its weather, or Google Notifier to
</I>&gt;<i> notify you of new messages if you block this function??).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You ask &quot;why is it important to block port 80?&quot; Answer: it isn't. The
</I>&gt;<i> old axiom applies: just because you CAN do a thing doesn't mean it's
</I>&gt;<i> a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I find that most people who want to use Little Snitch have two
</I>&gt;<i> purposes for it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. (my use) Find out if there are any apps on your system that are
</I>&gt;<i> sending out info when you don't want them too (checking for
</I>&gt;<i> keyloggers, for example, or just finding out which apps &quot;phone home&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> for updates or other purposes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Hiding pirated apps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion to you is to watch what Little Snitch alerts you to and
</I>&gt;<i> understand what it's asking, then give or deny permission
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly. If an app like WeatherDock wants to send info out, I
</I>&gt;<i> think it's something of a no-brainer that there is no sinister intent
</I>&gt;<i> -- it needs to update its weather info, so you should give it
</I>&gt;<i> permission to do so &quot;forever.&quot; The only time you really need to deny
</I>&gt;<i> permission is either intent #2 above, or you've just downloaded an
</I>&gt;<i> app you're not sure about.
