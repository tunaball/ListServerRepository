<PRE>I started this thread thinking the idea of setting up a separate partition
for OS X swap space will not survive.  It did not, thanks to you guys.  I
very much appreciate the thought provoking answers from Mike, Alex, Randy,
and Kirk, all on the same day.

Now what partitions on two hard drives will I have?  I'm sending the list a
separate e-mail with a volume map for this question.

OK, no OS X swap partition.

</I>&gt;<i> nothing to prevent you from having more than one copy of OS 9 on the
</I>&gt;<i> same drive or partition.
</I>
I see OS 9 for booting on one drive and OS X on the second drive with a
mini-version of OS 9 there for Classic.  I will avoid two copies of OS 9 on
the same partition, according to the old convention.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The apps and data will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all be on other volumes, I hope.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having apps on a different volume is going to take a little extra
</I>&gt;<i> housekeeping -especially where Software Update is concerned. Assuming
</I>&gt;<i> you're a relative newbie (this is a newbies list) I wouldn't recommend

</I>&gt;<i> problem as long as you're not worried about permissions (set it to
</I>&gt;<i> ignore permissions on that drive or partition). There are ways to set
</I>&gt;<i> all this up, but I'd be very sure you want to go through the hassle
</I>&gt;<i> before you do it.
</I>
I'll keep OS X apps and data in the OS X volume.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes, I am an OS X Newbie, sorry if I confused Alex.  It's just that I've
been reading and thinking about the real and possible issues of finally
making a slow transiton from OS 9 to OS X.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In OS X , it's not a good idea to have apps on a separate partition
</I>&gt;<i> from the boot partition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's nice to see you guys agreeing on this.  Along with Randy's web link
saying that data files are not usually subject to fragmentation as with OS
9, I'm convinced.

</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. If you plan to boot in OS 9 (as opposed to Classic) it's a good idea

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>So I'll have a minimal OS 9.2.2 in the OS X Panther hard drive for Classic.
The other hard drive will have the &quot;boot&quot; OS 9.2.2.

I think all this gives me an excellent direction to follow.  I'll show my
tentative partitioning plan to the list in a separate e-mail.

Many thanks,
