<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Jennifer Thomas &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-newbies.html">jthomas at thevoicecoach.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   I have a year 2000 model iMac (version = 32.1) 350 Mhz, Power PC G3
</I>&gt;<i> using
</I>&gt;<i> Mac OSX 10.2.8.  I do not have firewire.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I trust that you have started a savings account for your next computer, 
but in the meantime let's see if we can help you with this one.

&gt;<i> My capacity hard drive space is 6.99 GB, but I'm down to 555.9 MB
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is very bad. OS X needs lots of free space for temp files and swap 
space. As you've already concluded, your hard drive is too small to 
sustain a full installation of OS X and the apps you need.

&gt;<i> The only large files I have left are in iTunes and iPhoto.  Are there
</I>&gt;<i> any duplicates that
</I>&gt;<i> these apps store that I could delete?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>There's a program called &quot;iPhoto Diet&quot; that deletes the original photos 
and keeps the iPhoto copy (which you may have rotated or 
altered/cropped/fixed). While this will save you some space, I can't 
recommend this idea as it is always a bad move to delete the original. 
You might consider exporting your iPhoto photos (at least some of them 
to a CD-burner (if you have one) or to another hard drive (if you have 
one). Or just have a larger hard drive installed and have the people 
who do that for you copy the contents of your current hard drive over 
to it.

&gt;<i> Also, how large a hard drive can I install in my computer?
</I>
120GB, which would do you a world of good and are attractively priced 
at the moment. If you look for a model that offers 8MB of cache and has 
a speed of 7200RPM, you'll notice a significant speed bump as well. I'd 
recommend you purchase and install one at your earliest opportunity.

If you're not in a position to buy a newer computer anytime soon, you 
might also investigate whether the HARMONi upgrade from 
<A HREF="http://www.sonnettech.com">http://www.sonnettech.com</A> is cost-effective for you. Among other 
benefits (speed), it adds a Firewire port that would enable you to add 
external Firewire CD-burners and hard drives -- in effect giving you a 
whole new computer.

Read the PDB of August 6th, 2001 for yourself:

and then tell me how the President could go on vacation for a month.
