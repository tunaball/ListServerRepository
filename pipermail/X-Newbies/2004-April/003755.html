<PRE>To delete the Icon files (hint credit from macosxhints.com) type the 
following in the terminal:

find $HOME/Library/Safari/Icons -type f -atime +30 -name &quot;*.cache&quot; 
-delete

This deletes all icons not accessed within 30 days.  Change 30 to 
anything else you like.  Remove -delete from the end to see what it 
will delete, or add -print just before the -delete to see what it is 
deleting.

I have the following script run as part of my maintenance scripts 
(within Macaroni) which outputs the results to a log file (clears out 
caches and icons).  Create a file such as maintenance.sh - I use 
Documents/Scripts to store these and insert whatever commands you wish 
to use in this file.  I have included mine below as an example.  In the 
terminal, issue the following command to make it executable:

chmod 755 /Users/your_username/Documents/scripts/maintenance.sh

Then within Macaroni create a new job and include the path to the 
script file you just created - I also have a log file in that same 
directory called maintenance.log  Macaroni will create this for you if 
there's not one there.  As an example, I have included my 
maintenance.sh script below which I have set to run once a week:

#!/bin/sh

# echo start message
echo &quot;Cache Clean Script Processing&quot;

sudo rm -r /Users/your_username/Library/Caches/*
sudo rm -r /Library/Caches/*
sudo rm -r /System/Library/Caches/*

echo &quot;Cache Cleared&quot;

echo &quot;Deleting unused Safari Icons&quot;

find /Users/your_username/Library/Safari/Icons -type f -atime +7 -name 
&quot;*.cache&quot; -delete

echo &quot;Icons Cleared&quot;

Hope this is of some use...
