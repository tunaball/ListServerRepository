<PRE>This is a stale problem - i looked at it months ago, didn't find a 
resolution, and am just now getting back to it.

I have two OS X machines - a 17&quot; PB and a G5.  Both came with Jaguar, 
plus several third-party applications and demos (Intuit and Omni come 
to mind) installed in the Applications folder.  On both systems I wiped 
the disks and did a fresh partitioning/installation of Panther.  My own 
program installations (Office, etc.) were backed up and restored, as I 
keep them in a separate location, but because I wasn't using any of the 
third-party apps at the time, I neglected to back them up.  These apps 
didn't come with the Panther upgrade and were lost.

The question now is - how do I recover these applications onto a 
Panther installation without fouling it up?  I have the original Jaguar 
install DVDs for both machines.  If I put the G5 DVD in and open it, I 
have &quot;Install Mac OS X&quot;, and &quot;Install Applications and Classic 
Support&quot;, the latter looking more like what I want.  However, if I run 
that app, while it gives me a standard app installer sequence, it only 
allows for a &quot;basic installation of this software package&quot;.  Frankly, 
I'm afraid to proceed without better information as to what it's going 
to install where.

Can anyone validate if this is the correct approach/package, or suggest 
an alternative method?

Thanks!

KeS
