&lt;<A HREF="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hispanic">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hispanic</A>&gt;

Additional points:

(1) Why did you think this was a reference to you? (If it's your name, 
I was always under the impression that Aranzazu was Euskal, not Spanish 
-- please do correct me if I'm wrong.)

(2) Should anyone here refer to you as &quot;Hispanic&quot;, and should this 
reference be offensive to you, all you need to do is say so. The whole 
point of this conversation is about it. Some, no doubt, will argue that 
it's their constitutional right to go on using it as much as they wish; 
or, perhaps, that they do not wish to privilege a certain 
Weltanschauung. But those with good taste and manners will get your 
point.

(3) Some apparently have missed that my original post (which did _not_ 
start this thread) was not about Charles and his rather pathetical 
sigs. I first contacted the person in question off-list, and only when 
no reply was forthcoming, did I post something to the list. Since then, 
he did reply off-list, and the issue, I believe, has been settled to 
mutual satisfaction. As to the sigs you are so exercised about, true, I 
find them slightly (and sadly) annoying, but not enough to make a fuss 
about them. And, yes, I do think it would be nice if we left out of a 
Mac list anything having to do with politics, religion, or race, and it 
seems to me the reason why should be pretty obvious by now.

&gt;<i> [...] do you see someone on the street dressed in shirt that you find
</I>&gt;<i> offensive and &quot;suggest&quot; to them that they should go home and change
</I>&gt;<i> there shirt????
</I>
This is not the street.
