</I>As a person who is open minded and not generally offended by &quot;sigs&quot; on 
lists, I am beginning to feel like those against the use of politically 
or religiously provocative &quot;sigs&quot; are making more sense. They are 
winning. The EGO is a very funny thing. It is terrified of just 
blending into a faceless crowd where nobody will know what it's going 
through. However, most of the more active members of this list do not 
need sigs to get attention ;-) We are a wild bunch. At first I found it 
strange that the sig that started the whole thing was directing us to a 
place where we could learn about Jesus (in addition to Mac and Palm 
software and advice.) Having been raised in a Christian home it did not 
even raise an eyebrow on me. OK, I guess it did for a moment.  But it 
did not upset me. Then I kept reading through the week, having my mind 
opened more and I started to think, &quot;What if I was Muslim, or Hindu, or 
Buddhist?&quot; Would I find the sig in question innocuous then? Or would it 
offend me. If I were a diehard Bush supporter, would I be offended and 
insulted by some of the political sigs? I have enjoyed this discussion, 
though at times it has been more than challenging. I doubt that 
anything is really going to change, given the nature of the EGO, and 
probably that's best. I think everyone has had an opportunity to 
reflect on the situation, and decide if their sig is meant to educate 
or offend.
I am going away for a week, and will unsubscribe and return next week. 
I will not be surprised to find this discussion still going on, hahaha. 
Anyway, have fun. See you next week.
Greg C.
