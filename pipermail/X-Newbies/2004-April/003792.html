I'd be curious about such a list myself. I expect that apps which 
required direct access to hardware or the file system will either not 
work (e.g., CD-Copy, ZTerm v1.01) or cause file damage. Other apps 
should work, by and large, pretty well, though you may encounter the 
odd cosmetic bug (e.g., Quark v4.11).

</I>
Mac OS X is _not_ Mac as you know it. So gird your loins for the 
journey from scratch. Read, mark, and inwardly digest a good book 
(e.g., David Pogue's &quot;Missing Manual&quot;) and forget about being a Mac 
expert. That will come in handy, but only after you accept that this 
ain't Kansas any more.

&gt;<i> What's the easiest way to transfer all my stuff from one to the other,
</I>
Hook up your machines in a LAN and copy &quot;all your stuff&quot;.

&gt;<i> especially thinking about stuff that's going to mess up Classic? 
</I>&gt;<i> Should I
</I>&gt;<i> just forget about 3rd party extensions, etc.?
</I>
What exactly is &quot;stuff&quot;? You can add extensions to Classic one by one 
or in small groups, to weed out possible troublemakers. The same 
applies as above -- anything which accesses hardware directly won't 
work, most of the rest should. Even MacsBug works!

&gt;<i> What must-have (pref. freeware) apps should I know about as a new OS X 
</I>&gt;<i> user?
</I>
I'm sure you'll get lots of answers from the list. I suggest something 
different. Don't worry about must-have apps for now. Get your new 
system going. Set up a back up solution. Then learn the new OS, 
customizing it as little as possible to begin with. As you come across 
a task apps and utils bundled with the OS can't do, post a question 
here. In this way you get a feel for the system, and your toolkit will 
grow with your needs.

&gt;<i> What's the easiest way to import video from my VHS home movies? [...]
</I>
You need a converter or other device to convert the analogue signal to 
DV. You'll find plenty of suggestions on the web; you could start at  
&lt;<A HREF="http://guide.apple.com/uscategories/hwinput.lasso">http://guide.apple.com/uscategories/hwinput.lasso</A>&gt;. If I were you, I'd 
be looking into purchasing a Mac-compatible DV camcorder with analogue 
inputs. Pricey, but can do more with it than just VHS to DV.
