Don't go looking for any core.xxx files. I believe the term is an 
inheritance from pre-semiconductor days, when memory was a &quot;core&quot; of 
ferrite rings (and sometimes reached such amazing values as 32KB). When 
a process was aborted due to an internal error, a listing of the 
contents of the &quot;core&quot; (core dump or core file) was generated, which 
was used by the programmers trying to find out what had gone wrong.

Those days are long gone, but &quot;core dump&quot;, &quot;core files&quot;, or just 
&quot;core&quot;, are still used to describe a listing of a section of memory 
generated when an internal error causes a crash, and used to debug the 
respective piece of software.

As such, you will find &quot;core files&quot; generated by crashing apps in 
/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/ and ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/; a 
system crash is a kernel panic, and its core is dumped to PRAM and 
written to disk in /Library/Logs/panic.log upon restart (cf. Apple KB 
article ID 106227).

&gt;<i> It's unlikely any of us have these files, but if present they are log 
</I>&gt;<i> files you can safely delete.
</I>
They can be safely deleted, indeed. They aren't of much use, except to 
programmers who understand the applications whose crash generated them. 
However, app crashes are not unusual, and I suspect most of us have a 
couple of them in those locations; kernel panics are rarer, and so 
panic.log may be absent. Unless you're experincing an unusually high 
number of crashes and panics, I shouldn't expect these files to be 
large; all told, I'd be surprised if they amounted to more than, say, 
5MB.

There, now you've read my core dump on the subject of core files.
