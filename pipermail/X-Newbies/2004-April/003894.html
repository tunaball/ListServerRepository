Why not. I am Half native American and i have to deal with the image 
of my people being distorted daily. everything from the wooden Indian 
at the local cigar shop to seeing how we are depicted in movies and 
American culture. How would you like to grow up with the constant 
media and cultural bombardment of your people always being called 
barbarian murdering savages? My people are insulted every day, most 
Americans play cowboys and Indians as a child and they are taught 
that the Indians are the bad guys. Does your own government deny the 
fact that they tried to commit genocide on your people by offering 5 
dollars for your scalp. and sending there army after your ancestors?

The other half of me is Latino. or as you so offensively put it 
Hispanic. I will not go any further into this cause it is just 
beating dead horse.

Don't try to cover the issue of individual expression by talking 
about the horrors or ignorance of others.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  In an open forum like this you have to take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  the good with the bad the offensive and the pleasant comments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Only if they concern the Mac. And not even then. Would you find it
</I>&gt;<i>acceptable if I expressed my disagreement with you about the advantages
</I>&gt;<i>of partitioning the boot drive by a volley of what is euphemistically
</I>&gt;<i>known as &quot;four-letter words&quot;?
</I>
yes this forum is about Macs and it should stay that way. thread like 
this really should not be started in the first place.


&gt;<i>There are rules of civilized behaviour even in public places, and 
</I>&gt;<i>even more so in those which aren't entirely public. This place a 
</I>&gt;<i>meeting space for people with interest in Macs, who come here by 
</I>&gt;<i>choice and have a right not to have their religious (or political) 
</I>&gt;<i>sentiments offended by other subscribers' sigs.
</I>
yes you are right there are rules of civilized behavior and of 
decency. and i personally feel that you are not following said rules. 
do you see someone on the street dressed in shirt that you find 
offensive and &quot;suggest&quot; to them that they should go home and change 
there shirt???? I would hope not. yet you &quot;suggest&quot; to someone to 
change there sig??? that persons shirt and that persons sig is form 
of individual expression and it should not be edited in any way. even 
if it is a &quot;KMFDM&quot; shirt, a &quot;make love to war&quot; shirt, &quot;impeach bush 
shirt&quot;, or a &quot;Jesus loves you&quot; shirt.

Just as you have been been allowed to express yourself here on the 
forum so should others. Even if it is in the form of a signature.
