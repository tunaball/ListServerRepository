<PRE>Thanks KOZAK for the thorough summary; seems like the T68x is not nearly as
beloved as I'd suspected when I first posted my question.

Follow-up: Which is likely to happen first:
a. The superior Nokia/Siemens phones support Mac and iCal
b. Sony/Ericsson intros models that are equal in quality AND support
Mac/iCal (as it seems, there new phones don't do iCal).
c. another scenario

???

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [BTM] Best Bluetooth Phone
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You have to decide for what do you want to use your future phone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can use it for three things:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Address book pop-up message for incoming calls
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Address book/calendar synchronization
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Internet access
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For 1) and 3) all bluetooth phones are OK. My sister uses a Nokia
</I>&gt;<i> 6310i. It has an extremly fast menu, instantenous, really. It has T9
</I>&gt;<i> for many languages, not just English, and you can use different T9 and
</I>&gt;<i> menu languages. It has a huge memory for addresses (and can store
</I>&gt;<i> addresses, e-mails, phone numbers, etc.), has a very good calendar,
</I>&gt;<i> java capabilities (can download software, huge amount of games, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> It also has a huge battery life, between 1-2 weeks, depending how much
</I>&gt;<i> you use bluetooth and how much you talk. Really excellent phone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Siemens phones are quite popular here, in fact the most popular. A
</I>&gt;<i> great addition beginning from the S45 is the possibility to access the
</I>&gt;<i> memory as a file structure. You can archive to the phone memory
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of sms, pictures, etc, and on the PC, you can upload any txt
</I>&gt;<i> files (like trains schedules, bank office open times, etc.) for
</I>&gt;<i> reference. Or you can enter it as SMS, and save, so you have a
</I>&gt;<i> virtually unlimited message pad. Siemens has a bit wired menu
</I>&gt;<i> structure, but one you get onto it, no problem. And there is an
</I>&gt;<i> excellent feature: you can map any function to the number keys, not
</I>&gt;<i> only phone numbers. Like that, you can have direct access to bluetooth
</I>&gt;<i> switch on/off, calendar, notepad, etc. Siemens really likes to put all
</I>&gt;<i> functionalty in, at a lower price.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want address book/calendar synchronization, there are two
</I>&gt;<i> options. First, you can use iSync with the Ericsson R520, T39 and T68,
</I>&gt;<i> T68m, T68i, and only via bluetooth. If you want to sync with Entourage,
</I>&gt;<i> there is mobilesync, it can sync via cable, bluetooth, infrared, and
</I>&gt;<i> supports, Ericsson R520, T39, T68, T68m, T68i, and T65. The R520 and
</I>&gt;<i> T39 has a slow menu structure compared to Siemens and Nokia phones. The
</I>&gt;<i> T68 is also quite slow, but it can be upgraded for free by any Ericsson
</I>&gt;<i> Service point to the T68i software, which is way faster, and allows
</I>&gt;<i> access to a larger amount of memory (physically the T68, T68m and T68i
</I>&gt;<i> have the same electronics inside).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that you can synchronize or not depends on the synchronization
</I>&gt;<i> protocol your phone uses. iSync and MobileSync uses the IrMC language
</I>&gt;<i> to sync, and currently only these few Ericsson phones use this
</I>&gt;<i> protocol. Nokia uses a proprietary protocol, the SonyEricsson P800 uses
</I>&gt;<i> SyncML, so they are not supported.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I myself bought a T68m two weeks ago, and had the software upgraded to
</I>&gt;<i> the T68i software a week ago. The speed change is dramatic. Compared to
</I>&gt;<i> the Nokia and Siemens phones I had, it is slow and not intuitive at
</I>&gt;<i> all. The joy on the T68 is not very good, you can get used to it, but I
</I>&gt;<i> don't like it. Overall the phone feels like a toy. Battery life is
</I>&gt;<i> good, if you don't talk or use bluetooth and never connect via gprs. I
</I>&gt;<i> talk, have bluetooth switched on all day long, set up the automatic
</I>&gt;<i> e-mail access for 2 hours on the phone, and browse the net for 1 hour
</I>&gt;<i> each day (bluetooth+gprs), and have to recharge each two days. There is
</I>&gt;<i> no desk stand (that could both charge the phone and a second battery).
</I>&gt;<i> The address book can store only phone numbers and e-mail, it cannot
</I>&gt;<i> store mail addresses. I would say the 6310i rules over the T68 for me
</I>&gt;<i> in every aspect, but it cannot sync with my mac, so I had to go for the
</I>&gt;<i> T68. The worst in all Ericsson phones is the fact that the Yes/No and
</I>&gt;<i> Pick up/Hang up is on the same keys. If you are in the middle writing
</I>&gt;<i> an SMS, or brwosing your calendar, no luck... while on the Nokia, you
</I>&gt;<i> can pick up/hang up independently. There is no T9 in Hungarian for the
</I>&gt;<i> T68, what is very basic today, I think.
</I>&gt;<i> The colour screen is also ambivalent... it is easier to read black text
</I>&gt;<i> on white compared to dark grey on light gray, but in strong sunlight it
</I>&gt;<i> is hard to read. No unreadable, but hard to read. The backlight of the
</I>&gt;<i> T68 is also very strong for the eye, Nokia and Siemens has a more ample
</I>&gt;<i> setting.
</I>&gt;<i> So, the T68 is not a bad phone, not a good phone, it is a rather
</I>&gt;<i> average phone by my standards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if you don't need address book sync, you can choose any bluetooth
</I>&gt;<i> phone you like. The Best bluetooth phone is the Ericsson P800 I think,
</I>&gt;<i> then the Nokia 7650 is very close. If you need sync, you have to
</I>&gt;<i> content with one of the R520 - T39 - T68.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you have any question, I am happy to reply.
</I>&gt;<i> Imre
