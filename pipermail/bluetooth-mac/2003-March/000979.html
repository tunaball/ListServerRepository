<PRE>The first time my T68 went to fix the excuse was EXACTLY the same: 
fault not covered under warranty due to water problem. My thought? Bull.

I have a friend who knows somebody at Ericsson tech department (or the 
company who does it for them) to whom my phone was given to see if he 
could &quot;do anything to it&quot;. He fixed it. Apparently the phone has to be 
taken apart almost to the barest elements, it's put inside some special 
liquid that cleans the circuitry, it's cleaned and then is put back 
together. It had 4 non-working keys (although they clicked) and when I 
got the phone back they worked flawlessly. It's been a month since then 
and 2 of the same keys are starting to need stronger presses in order 
to work.

I honestly think that this is a very fragile phone especially keyboard 
wise, and Ericsson rather than admitting it, calls it a water problem 
because it's their only escape from probably doing a very time 
consuming fix under warranty. If the T68 goes haywire again I'm going 
back to my trustworthy T39 and wait for the T610... if the P800 is too 
bulky. I haven't held one yet.

If someone has a mid-life crisis while playing hide &amp; seek, does he
automatically lose because he can't find himself?
