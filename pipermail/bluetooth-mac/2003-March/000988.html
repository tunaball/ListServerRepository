If this is a very common problem with that phone model, it would seem 
to be a design flaw, unless all owners are using it underwater...

Form a group and hire a lawyer and sue.

I use a Samsung i300 which I have carried in my shirt pocket for over a 
year. In South Florida we perspire a lot and it rains. My phone has 
been constantly subjected to both and never failed. One major 
difference is the keypad is a touch screen and has no moving parts.

When I go into the Sprint store, I often see more people lined up at 
the repair counter than at the sales counter so I assume that these new 
super small phones have a high failure rate.

Maybe there is a website somewhere to register your failure, the 
refusal to repair the phone, etc. If not, then start one. If it turns 
out that 30% of the buyers are suffering the same failure and being 
refused a warranty repair, I am sure than info will be of interest to 
some government agency, lawyer and the competitors of the phone 
mfg...Hey, don't by the xxxx it has a 30% failure rate and they refuse 
to repair it.

Also, write a nice letter, not a rant and not a threat, to the various 
department heads of the company and the CEO. List the problem and that 
you know of at least xxx people with the same problem. What is going 
on. How can you help, etc.

It would also help to know who is doing the repair. Is it the 
manufacturer or the small store where you bought it...
