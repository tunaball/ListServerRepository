Bill,


   We are only two weeks away from the MacWorld Expo.  I would wait
until I see what Bluetooth mice are introduced at the expo.  If you
HAVE to get a mouse now, I would look into the Kensington Bluetooth
PilotMouse.  You can right click, left click, use the scroll wheel as
a third button, plus you can press the right and left buttons
together, essentially giving you a fourth button.


Regards,

<excerpt>My favorite mouse, alas, is wired.  It is the Logitech
Notebook optical

mouse plus, which is small and has two buttons and a scroll wheel.


I would love to have a bluetooth version of this mouse, or something as

good.  Any recommendations?  I don't like the Apple Wireless Mouse
because

of its size and lack of features.


Thanks!


Bill Planey
