Here's a review of a virtual keyboard that works via Bluetooth. It
looks like it doesn't work on a Mac (yet). The site is for iPAQs and
the review is done on an iPAQ.

<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param><x-tad-smaller>I know there
are a lot of Bluetooth mice on the market, however, I see slim
Bluetooth keyboard offerings. Am I correct that at the moment the only
Bluetooth keyboard on the market is Apple's Wireless Keyboard? Or were
there other Bluetooth keyboards introduced at the MacWorld Expo in San
Francisco?
