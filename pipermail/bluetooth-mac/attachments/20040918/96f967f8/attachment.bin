Gino,

I have my Bluetooth dongle plugged into a hub and have had no problems
connecting my phone with it. If your desk is metal it might reduce the
range a bit, otherwise I doubt it would have any effect.

the MacWireless Bluetooth USB Adapter or the  D-Link DBT-120 USB
Bluetooth Adapter be plugged into USB hubs or must such adapters be
plugged directly to the USB port of the computer, in my case, a
PowerMac G4 500?  If you can plug such adapters into USB hubs, then I
thought I would mention that I have my USB hub under my desk.  Would
having my USB hub down there effect performance?
