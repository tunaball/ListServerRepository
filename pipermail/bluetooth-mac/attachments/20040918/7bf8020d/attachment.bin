<fontfamily><param>Arial</param>Can Bluetooth devices such as the
MacWireless Bluetooth USB Adapter or the  D-Link DBT-120 USB Bluetooth
Adapter be plugged into USB hubs or must such adapters be plugged
directly to the USB port of the computer, in my case, a PowerMac G4
500?  If you can plug such adapters into USB hubs, then I thought I
would mention that I have my USB hub under my desk.  Would having my
USB hub down there effect performance?
