<PRE>I find that I can usually just unplug the usb bluetooth adapter (I have 
the D-Link one you likely also got) and plug it back in. Also if you 
have the bluetooth adapter plugged in when you start up your Mac it 
won't work - you can fix this, though, by unplugging the adapter and 
plugging it back in. I believe this is the case for logging in too - if 
you log in with it already plugged in, get in the habit of unplugging 
the module and plugging it back in. Lastly, if your computer goes to 
sleep with it plugged in, it probably won't function when you wake the 
computer up so do the same fix again.

I tend to blame the problems on bluetooth and not Apple. I have 
intermittent problems going from my TungstenT to my T68i phone as well 
and the solution there is even more esoteric/confusing - so it's not 
just Apple's implementation. Basically, bluetooth seems to be a hack 
job and not a particular good one at that, but when it works it is 
pretty cool. Love-Hate, you know....

</I>&gt;<i> sequence: I have to unplug the dongle, shutdown the computer, plug the 
</I>&gt;<i> dongle, boot the computer, and half of the times the dongle is 
</I>&gt;<i> recognized after boot up, and works. Some times the dongle is 
</I>&gt;<i> recognized (the B appears in the menu bar not crossed-out) but when

</I>&gt;<i> the times, the name of the computer appears as in the sharing 
</I>&gt;<i> preferences, and the devices that had been added to the list of 
</I>&gt;<i> devices re-appear. If I then set the computer to sleep and unplug the 
</I>&gt;<i> dongle, there is no way that the computer will recognize it again 
</I>&gt;<i> unless I go through the tedious process of unplugging, shutting down 
</I>&gt;<i> and rebooting again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have read that similar things have happened to other users, and 
</I>&gt;<i> would like to know if there is any solution to re-enable Bluetooth 
</I>&gt;<i> without having to shut down. Removing a preference file? Killing a 
</I>&gt;<i> process? or what else?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it is a problem with the system extensions I have installed, I 
</I>&gt;<i> have not tried to deactivate them, but they are: Dave, MaxMenus, 
</I>&gt;<i> DefaultFolder, FruitMenu and WindowShade.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any help, appreciated!
