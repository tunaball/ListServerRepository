Adapter is : MPI Tech Bluetooth Print Adapter
Printer is:  HP Deskjet 970cse
Printer Driver:  Gimp-Print-4.2.6 available at 
&lt;<A HREF="http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/">http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/</A>&gt;

Procedure was to follow gimp instructions and setup USB printer to 
verify printer and software.  Then install MPI Tech Adapter per MPI 
instructions and followed gimp instruction same as for USB except 
selected bluetooth instead.  Worked first time!

DETAILED PROCEDURE FOR BLUETOOTH

1.  With printer power off, MPI Tech Adapter was installed on the HP 
printer and all power turned on.
2.   The Printer Setup Utility program was opened and in the Printer 
List window menu bar,  &quot;Add&quot; was clicked.
3.  A new window dropped down, and in its the upper pull-down menu, 
&quot;Bluetooth&quot; was selected. 
4.  The utility program then scanned for printers and eventually 
listed:  &quot;DESKJET 970C, Bluetooth Printer Adapter 
HEWLETT-PACKARD&quot; in the list window.
5.  Then the newly found printer was selected (high-lighted).
6.  In the lower pull-down menu, Printer Model:   HP was selected for 
Hewlett-Packard.
7.  And in yet another drop-down window, Model Name:   &quot;HP Deskjet 
900 series - CUPS+Gimpo-Print v4.2.6&quot; was selected for software.
8.  And then at very bottom, the  green button:  &quot;Add&quot; was clicked
9.  And then all of the drop-downs and windows rolled up leaving the 
Printer Setup Utility Printer List window showing the previous USB 
printer as &quot;DISKJET 970C&quot; and the added printer as &quot;DESKJET 970C, 
Bluetooth Printer Adapter&quot;.

A check of the print dialog window shows a USB print choice of 
&quot;DESKJET 970C&quot; OR bluetooth print choice &quot;DESKJET 970C, Bluetooth 
Print...&quot;.  With both the USB cable and the adapter connected to the 
printer, printing with either appears normal.  Actually, some erratic 
operation with the Panther supplied HP drivers has been 
experienced...printer seems to cycle a number of times to aline with 
the leading edge of the paper.  The Gimp-supplied driver seems quite 
smooth.  Additionally, every conceivable make and model appears to be 
included in the set.  After a little test-time to insure adequate 
operation, USB cable will be abandoned and the very old HP printer 
will be move from atop a book case to a more handy location.

Additionally, Gimp set of drivers appears quite complete, but also 
Panther and Bluetooth 1.5 seems to be minimum requirement.
