<PRE>I've had some rather disappointing experiences sync'ing my Z600 and 
PowerBook G4 using iSync. The concept seems simple but, somewhere in 
the execution of it all, I get duplicate contact entries on the 
PowerBook and the phone. I've taken to adding contacts one-at-a-time 
using the Bluetooth aware feature of Address Book. Admittedly, I 
haven't given iSync more than a few tries so I may not have worked 
out all the bugs in my setup. At this point, all my numbers are in 
the phone and on the computer so I haven't made it a priority.

As for the GPRS connectivity issue, I use it fairly regularly with 
decent results. It's great to be able to grab your email while your 
plane is parked at the gate or when you're on a long drive and 
there's no other 'Net access. It's not fast and it's not secure and 
you won't be downloading video clips, using iChat or anything like 
that, but I really appreciate having the option to successfully send 
and receive email and do some minor web surfing whenever the urge 
strikes.

Perhaps the most compelling reason to use a Bluetooth phone as a GPRS 
modem is to stay connected when traveling abroad. I had flawless 
service recently when I traveled from the US to England and Italy. I 
was able to keep in touch with folks back home and even get sports 
scores as I sipped a coffee in the morning. For a very small amount 
of money, it provided a nice little slice of home while vacationing 
in a far away place.

&gt;<i>I have had Bluetooth since it cam out, I just don't have any devices to pair
</I>&gt;<i>with. :) I want to move to a phone that supports it and I have a question
</I>&gt;<i>for you about the Z600
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Do you also use this phone for internet connectivity? I need to sync my
</I>&gt;<i>phone numbers as well, but occasionally I need to connect my power book to
</I>&gt;<i>the internet when a WiFi isn't available.
