&gt;<i> I need help,
</I>&gt;<i> I purchased the Nokia 3650 to use with my Mac because I was told it had many
</I>&gt;<i> features that worked well with the Mac (and it does).  It's been fun learning
</I>&gt;<i> how it works and all the features but I continue to have a few problems. I
</I>&gt;<i> thought the problems might be due to the off brand dongle I was using
</I>&gt;<i> (io-gear) so I switched to the Mac-indorsed (D-link 120) dongle.  I still have
</I>&gt;<i> the same issues as before.  I then tried swapping the phone.  The same
</I>&gt;<i> problems persist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So getting to my two issues:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Issue #1
</I>&gt;<i> iSync, Address Book and contacts in the phone:
</I>&gt;<i> This use to work fine but somewhere along the line I added a new contact into
</I>&gt;<i> the phone and now when I try to use iSync, I get an error message:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've somehow used a field or something that has violated the rules for iSync.
</I>&gt;<i> This use to work fine, I&#185;ve made no changes on the phone or computers
</I>&gt;<i> software, but when I backup, then dump the phones memory, then reload it with
</I>&gt;<i> an older (much older) archive of contacts, it works fine again.  The problem
</I>&gt;<i> is I've added a ton of contacts to the phone that I can't get into my Mac&#185;s
</I>&gt;<i> Address Book.  Any help here would be really appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Issue #2 - (a little off topic but could really use help)
</I>&gt;<i> Nokia 3650 and bluetooth headphones:
</I>&gt;<i> I've been searching for a good bluetooth headphone that will work with this
</I>&gt;<i> phone.  It seems this phone bends the rule or has some characteristic that
</I>&gt;<i> makes it not work with most bluetooth headphones.  I've tried the &quot;Bluetrek&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> Nokia's own bluetooth headphone and the &quot;Jabra&quot; bluetooth product.  They all
</I>&gt;<i> would &quot;pare&quot; with the phone without problems but only the Nokia unit would
</I>&gt;<i> actually connect (about 95% of the time). Although the &quot;Nokia&quot; works, it was
</I>&gt;<i> not very comfortable, the battery charge would not last very long, and was not
</I>&gt;<i> loud enough (in a car I found myself pushing it against my ear to hear).  The
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Bluetrek&quot; fits well but would not connect to the phone.  The &quot;Jabra&quot; (design
</I>&gt;<i> similar to Bluetrek&#185;s) is also very comfortable but the unit I purchased
</I>&gt;<i> (BT-200) would not connect either.  I contacted Jabra's customer service about
</I>&gt;<i> this, they told me I needed to take the unit back and get the same model with
</I>&gt;<i> a blue sticker that says it works with my model of phone (how crazy is that,
</I>&gt;<i> same model with special sticker?).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh well, my problem is, I've searched every phone store I can fine looking for
</I>&gt;<i> this headset with the sticker&#138; No luck yet.  Any ideas on where to find this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you have experience with another headphone that works with this phone
</I>&gt;<i> please let me know?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, one last note from above, I've already exchanged the phone, I have the
</I>&gt;<i> same problems with the replacement unit but at this point am locked into this
</I>&gt;<i> type of phone. Again, Any help would be really appreciated.
