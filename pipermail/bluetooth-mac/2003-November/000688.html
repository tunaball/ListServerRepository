<PRE>I need help,
I purchased the Nokia 3650 to use with my Mac because I was told it had many
features that worked well with the Mac (and it does).  It's been fun
learning how it works and all the features but I continue to have a few
problems. I thought the problems might be due to the off brand dongle I was
using (io-gear) so I switched to the Mac-indorsed (D-link 120) dongle.  I
still have the same issues as before.  I then tried swapping the phone.  The
same problems persist.
 
So getting to my two issues:
 
Issue #1
iSync, Address Book and contacts in the phone:
This use to work fine but somewhere along the line I added a new contact
into the phone and now when I try to use iSync, I get an error message:
 
I've somehow used a field or something that has violated the rules for
iSync.  This use to work fine, I&#185;ve made no changes on the phone or
computers software, but when I backup, then dump the phones memory, then
reload it with an older (much older) archive of contacts, it works fine
again.  The problem is I've added a ton of contacts to the phone that I
can't get into my Mac&#185;s Address Book.  Any help here would be really
appreciated.
 
Issue #2 - (a little off topic but could really use help)
Nokia 3650 and bluetooth headphones:
I've been searching for a good bluetooth headphone that will work with this
phone.  It seems this phone bends the rule or has some characteristic that
makes it not work with most bluetooth headphones.  I've tried the
&quot;Bluetrek&quot;, Nokia's own bluetooth headphone and the &quot;Jabra&quot; bluetooth
product.  They all would &quot;pare&quot; with the phone without problems but only the
Nokia unit would actually connect (about 95% of the time). Although the
&quot;Nokia&quot; works, it was not very comfortable, the battery charge would not
last very long, and was not loud enough (in a car I found myself pushing it
against my ear to hear).  The &quot;Bluetrek&quot; fits well but would not connect to
the phone.  The &quot;Jabra&quot; (design similar to Bluetrek&#185;s) is also very
comfortable but the unit I purchased (BT-200) would not connect either.  I
contacted Jabra's customer service about this, they told me I needed to take
the unit back and get the same model with a blue sticker that says it works
with my model of phone (how crazy is that, same model with special
sticker?).
 
Oh well, my problem is, I've searched every phone store I can fine looking
for this headset with the sticker&#138; No luck yet.  Any ideas on where to find
this?
 
If you have experience with another headphone that works with this phone
please let me know?
 
Oh, one last note from above, I've already exchanged the phone, I have the
same problems with the replacement unit but at this point am locked into
this type of phone. Again, Any help would be really appreciated.

</PRE>
