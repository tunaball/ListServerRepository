I've just gotten one last friday and so far I'm VERY happy with it. 
Synced seamlessly with my mac and Tungsten T. I'm using iCal and 
address book to manage the info and syncing it all through iSync using 
mostly Bluetooth but sometimes USB for the Palm (it's faster and more 
reliable to install stuff on it). I change stuff on all three devices 
and they all end up having the same info on the next sync... maybe I'm 
just lucky because I've heard of some weird stuff going on with some 
users...

Address book works very well except one thing, when I get a call or sms 
I would think the caller ID or SMS window should come to the top but it 
doesn't for me. I think it used to with my old T68 so maybe I'm missing 
something here... Salling Clicker is also a must have application.. I 
love coming into the office and having iTunes start playing... it's 
also good at home when watching a DVD hooked up to the TV and having it 
pause automatically when you get a call besides being able to control 
the computer from the couch.

Two negative points on the phone: thickness and screen on a VERY bright 
day. It's actually thicker than the P800 (the one I had before) and the 
youre just barely able to see the screen on a bright day. Other than 
that, excellent phone... plus I got a Panther theme to go along with 
it... :-) It's actually a very complete and good theme.

Message me offline or on iChat if anybody wants it... <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/bluetooth-mac.html">emdub at mac.com</A>

As for headset, I didn't get a chance to test my HBH-30 on it cause it 
just died. :-( It doesn't turn on, charge or anyhting. Must send it in 
for repair. :'-(
