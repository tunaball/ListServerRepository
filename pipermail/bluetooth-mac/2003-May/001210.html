you should have been around when it was palm desktop 2.6.3 and palm was 
using avantgo as it's conduuit

then they upgraded to desktop 4, suddenly no third-party conduits 
seemed to work properly

and 1 and half years later, it's still no-go

it's one of the things that drives me nuts about palm, they use these 
third-party companies to offer services on the palm, then there is an 
update, and suddenly both palm and the third party are blaming each 
other - and absolutely nothing happens EVER

i have found that palm is one of those co's always promoting the next 
piece of equipment, whilst ignoring their past users

SOMETHING THAT WILL HAUNT PALM IN THE NEAR FUTURE METHINKS

so consider yourself lucky that SOME of your third-party apps actually 
still work

peter (a palm user, who now hardly trusts the pda to do anything except 
partially corrupt his address database, with it's bad interaction w 
iSync - referring here to the inability of the pda to sync with HOME 
addresses sincethe last update, which has corrupted over 2000 addresses)

THANK YOU PALM, YOU TOO DESERVE TO GO DOWN LIKE PSION - now only 
supplying software i believe (and supported by me for 15 years!!!!!)


grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
