<PRE>Headsets Heating Up

The wireless headset market is heating up further with many new 
entrants from Asia. &#160;However, the biggest recent news came from two 
well-recognized players, and one newcomer.

Plantronics expanded its line with its new M2500 Bluetooth headset that 
targets a price-conscious or entry-level purchaser, but features great 
sound quality and an over-the-ear lightweight design. The M2500 offers 
five hours of talk time, and 120 hours of standby time, and a soft 
SoundGuide earpiece for a stable, lightweight and comfortable fit. The 
headset features easy-to-use controls that enhance the user experience. 
The M2500 includes status indicators alerting users of power status, 
and is equipped for in-car charging. The M2500 joins Plantronics' M3000 
headset that is designed for users who require maximum talk and standby 
time, and the M3500 headset that is targeted to the mobile professional 
who requires superior audio quality. The M2500 will be available 
worldwide in May and will have a price of $89.95 (US).

Jabra launched its latest Bluetooth headset, the JABRA SP100 Bluetooth 
speakerphone. The portable SP100 offers portability as well as its 
other features. The JABRA SP100 can be used in the car, and in the 
office or home. The SP100 is supplied with a visor clip and suction 
mount, while the microphone offers a pivoting arm that can be 
positioned for optimum voice pick-up. The speakerphone is also equipped 
with a mute button and a headset port. With rechargeable batteries, the 
SP100 provides up to 12 hours of talk time, 20 days of standby time, 
and can be charged with an AC power adaptor, but the product can also 
operate with standard AA batteries (handy in a pinch). The SP100 will 
be available in North America in 2Q2004 with a price of $149 (US). Also 
recently, Jabra's three new Bluetooth headsets to be launched this 
summer include the Jabra BT500, the BT 800, and the BT110. &#160;The Jabra 
BT500 is the company's next generation Bluetooth headset, the Jabra 
BT800 is a full-featured, high-end headset, while the Jabra BT110 is an 
entry-level headset.

Newcomer STEP Communications revealed performance enhancements to its 
recent market entrant, the STEP 1150 Bluetooth Headset. &#160;Enhancements 
include increased talk time, dual Bluetooth profile support and a BTA-1 
adapter for non-Bluetooth phones (usable with STEP 1150 and 1100 
headsets). The BTA-1 allows owners of non-Bluetooth phones with an 
industry standard 2.5mm headphone jack to work with STEP's headsets. 
The resulting talk time now extends over 5.5 hours with standby time 
over 200 hours. &#160;In addition to improved power management, the STEP 
1150 now includes support for both the Bluetooth Headset and Hands-Free 
profiles, providing compatibility with a greater number of Bluetooth 
devices. Both the STEP 1150 and 1100 incorporate STEP's proprietary 
Acoustic Bubble technology that substantially reduces wind noise and 
other surrounding sounds, providing exceptional user-voice clarity. The 
1150 is priced at $99.95 (US).

With an increasing number of laws being passed worldwide regarding 
restrictions of mobile phone usage in vehicles, handsfree operation 
will be in demand at an increasing rate. In the US, the awareness level 
of Bluetooth for the average US consumer is taking a jump due to the 
recent TV automotive commercials mentioning Bluetooth. Worldwide, we 
expect demand for handsfree Bluetooth solutions, like headsets, to rise 
significantly due to these laws in addition to the increase in support 
from automotive manufacturers. &#160;We expect Bluetooth headsets to grow by 
a five-year compound annual growth rate of 60%.
