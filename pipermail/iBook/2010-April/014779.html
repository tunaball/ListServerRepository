<PRE>Jim, all, et al--

Thanks to Jim's suggestion, I dug my Powerbook 1400 out of my shed, powered it up with no problem, and it still appears to work just fine despite its age (about 15 years, about 1995) and its long term storage in my shed in the AZ desert with shade temps up to 120F (inside the shed likely gets up to 140F oven temps) has not appeared to affect its performance nor its LCD screen. Apple then, as now, puts out a superior machine.

Nostalgia time:  I bought the PB 1400 off eBay some five years ago since it had floppy capability (I had some old business floppies I needed to read). It arrived empty and I had to re-install OS 7.5.3. No problem since I'm a Mac vet going back to Apple IIC and IIG (mid-1980s), going through IIvx and 7300 until I upgraded to my now antiquated iBook 900 in 2003. The 1400 did the job for me, After I was done with it, I boxed the 1400 up and stored it in my shed until now when it was again needed, in this instance as an LCD screen test device under extreme environmental conditions. My PB 1400 came with a lot of Apple specifications of which I haven't seen for a long time: OS 7.5.3, RAM about 16mb, HD 1.3 gb (?), 603 processor of 133 mhz. I believe this was the first Mac laptop model which had CD ROM capable drive. It also has ClarisWorks 4 (predecessor of Appleworks and now I don't know what else since I still use Appleworks), Jade 1.2 (to view jpegs), and not much else as part of its system applications.

I didn't realize the simplicity of use and the stability of these older Macs until now after going through numerous Mac iterations and machines over the years until now with my new MacBook Pro. My now ancient iBook 900 which faithfully served me for 7 years will also go into storage right next to my PB 1400 if for no other reason than they still work and it appears they will continue to work indefinitely whenever I need them and want to turn them back on. For what more can I ask?

</I>&gt;<i>I'm a fulltime RVer (no stick-built house) with a permanent winter space in a tiny semi-boondocking RV park (40 units on 40 acres in the middle of the AZ desert somewhat halfway between Quartzsite and Phoenix). I am very space and weight limited during summer travel to cooler climes so remove everything from my travel trailer which I don't expect to need but I have two storage sheds on my site into which everything I don't carry is stored. (Yeah, OK, I'm basically a human packrat - bad characteristic on my part but it's genetic.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think your suggestion I check out my PowerBook 1400 fior LCD display is excellent! I never thought about it in several years. Powering it up might be a potential problem but I'll figure a work-around if its possible. Thank you for the suggestion!
</I>&gt;<i>t
</I>&gt;<i>You're right: Arizona desert heat starting about now (late March, is forecast to be in upper 80s in shade on Tues but there is no shade in the AZ desert - 90s+ is more likely), is not something with which I am comfortable (read: miserable). Normally, it'll be in the 100s come 15 April upon which I head out to Prescott, AZ in the mountains (elev 5400'; I'm at 1420') where I've gone from heatstroke weather in the morning here in the low desert to snow at night in the mountains.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Not an ideal living and climate situation, not sure if there is such a thing in continental US but sure as hell beats my old residence in upstate NY where Jan temps typically dip to minus 20F with heating bills $350/month. I'm not sure if the cool Northern CA coastal region might be any better in winter. Does any of that white stuff fall around your location?  The only s**w I ever want to see again is on a postcard :-D

</I>&gt;<i>Apple recommends storage temperatures no higher than 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Having visited relatives during the hottest summer days in Tucson and Phoenix (120 degrees F + in the shade with a light breeze), I still remember the time plastic toys, a dashtop catchall tray and interior and exterior soft trim pieces melted in and on our Dodge station wagon. And then there are the stories about how laptops left in car trunks or hidden under seats &quot;for just a few hours&quot; on a sunny day were found to have totally unusable LCDs, which is why Apple recommends 140 degrees F. storage temp. max.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So the first thing you might want to do is check out your PB 1400 to see how its LCD has held up to the heat. If it's still OK, then your iBook probably will be safe stored in that shed in the same area. If it were mine, I would put it in an antistatic pouch with several of those silicon bags found in shoe boxes, electronics boxes, etc. Then I'd put that inside a big &quot;zip lock&quot; bag with a few more silicon bags. I'd make sure there's plenty of air circulation around the bag.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But all of this raises the question about why you want to store such relatively small items in a shed instead of inside the house where temperatures are going to be much cooler. Unless you've got a high-end shed with central air or a swamp cooler. :^}
