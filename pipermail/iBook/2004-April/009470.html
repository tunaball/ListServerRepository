<PRE>&gt;<i> It is not Carbon Copy Cloner's fault, I don't think. I backed up all
</I>&gt;<i> my stuff and selected my 12 inch snow as the source and the new 14
</I>&gt;<i> inch G4 snow as the target and hit clone, thinking that it would make
</I>&gt;<i> a disk image on the hard drive.
</I>
You're right it was not CCC's fault. If you select clone, it will make 
an exact copy of the source to the target. That is not the speediest 
operation depending on how much stuff is on the drive. However, to 
complicate that, you also had different OS's to deal with. As a result, 
when you stopped it, the Jag book had not finished copying the Jag os 
to the Panther book and the Panther book was left with a fractured OS.

The Panther Book will need an OS  of some kind before you can continue. 
I suggest using the cds that came with the Panther book and restoring 
it to virginal condition UNLESS you also have a cd included that will 
let you separately install the applications that came with the Panther. 
My reason for this is because the Panther book will most likely have 
newer or different apps that can not be restored any other way. If you 
have a separate apps cd for the Panther, you can clone the Jag to the 
Panther book and then upgrade to Panther and install the new apps.

After the panther book has been restored, Target fire wire the drives 
again. This time, using CCC, create a disk image large enough to 
contain the Jag stuff first, (create this on the Panther book) then 
clone into the disc image. When deciding what to put in the disk image, 
remember that the system stuff is Jag and Panther and therefore the Jag 
system stuff is not necessary unless you want both a clone and to 
transfer data to the Panther book, if so, copy the entire drive to the 
disk image, if not, copy only the data that you personally have 
created, ie, your user's acct + any files that have been placed 
somewhere else than in the user acct, ie, in the application folder. As 
a precaution, explore all folders looking for errant data files that 
were misplaced, especially in the documents folder to the left of the 
home folder, the one that belongs to the hard drive not to a specific 
user.

If you clone everything, you will be able to open the disk image on the 
Panther book and transfer what you want to the Panther book and leave 
the clone image intact. I personally lock my disk image so it will stay 
intact no matter how many times i use it or how confused i get while 
using it.

Mike Bombich has a very lengthy and thorough online document that 
further explains this procedure and has suggestions for backup 
strategies.
