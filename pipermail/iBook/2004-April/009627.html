<PRE>Quick Q:

If I set my friends 12&quot; iBook 933 besides my clamshell 466SE his iBook 
is much brighter. Has any one had the experience to set similar iBooks 
side by side or know from experience if the clamshell has a darker 
screen, or are the tubes in my LCD aging?

Thanks


BTW talking about brightess, a funny thing happened when I was at my 
friends house this Sunday:

He was iBookin' while I was watching a Freddy movie (dunno what part), 
anyway suddenly he shouted: oh no my screen went dark! First thing I 
thought: oh oh the wire problem (his iBook falls into the logic board 
replacement category), I had talked with him about that earlier so it 
would really be a coincedence if the problem occured while I was there.
I looked at the screen and it looked like an older iMac where the 
firmware wasn't patched before updating to Jaguar. I said: you're sure 
you didn't touch the brightness keys?, and he said: no, but tried it 
anyway and the screen came on step by step. He said: oh yeah I was 
cleaning the left top part of my 'Book, but wasn't watching the screen, 
I was also watching the TV. So he unknowingly turned the brightness way 
down :-)

there's no place like 127.0.0.1
