<PRE>&gt;<i> I have recently purchased a wireless access point (not a router)
</I>
There's your first clue -- it's not a router. :-)

&gt;<i> to go with my new airport card.  I plugged the access point into my router, 
</I>&gt;<i> fired up the airport and voila I was surfing wireless.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... The manual says the default IP address of the 
</I>&gt;<i> access point is 192.168.1.100, but the router's internal address is 
</I>&gt;<i> 192.168.123.xxx, and thus computers connecting to this router are given 
</I>&gt;<i> IP addresses in this range.  Therefore the access point cannot have the 
</I>&gt;<i> default address, but so far I have been unable to discover the IP 
</I>&gt;<i> address of it.
</I>
That's because it's, in network terms, a &quot;switch&quot; or a
&quot;bridge&quot; (the only difference is that a switch attempts
to deliver only packets going to machines on the other
side, while a bridge simply copies everything from one
side to the other). Since they operate at the link-
layer, or MAC (Media Access Control, not Mac) level,
basically Ethernet addresses, they don't even *need* an
IP address to do what they're supposed to do. However,
most of them have an IP address so you can manage (i.e.
configure or monitor) them.

&gt;<i> Is there some way I can sniff out 
</I>&gt;<i> the access point's IP address?
</I>
It's most likely 192.168.1.100, just like the manual
says. Have you tried pinging that address from the
wireless side? You *might* have to manually give a laptop
an IP address like 192.168.1.88 to talk to it. You could
then run a port scan on it to see what it has available --
for example, if port 80 is open, you can talk to it with a
web browser.

I wouldn't worry about it though, if it's doing its job.
Switches are rather boring critters, when it comes right
down to it, unless you have a bunch of them talking to
each other in a network.

Heh... I knew that spending last week in a switching &amp;
routing class would come in handy. :-)

Pedantically yours,

    Larry
