<PRE>I advise the following: If the iBook serial number is 'in the range' 
*don't* get the Apple Care. Apple is already committed to fixing all 
those machines (check to see how much longer the program runs, if there 
is a time limit). If the serial number is not in the range, but is a G3 
Powerbook with a serial number before the range, or not long after it, 
do get the Apple Care.

I tend to *not* believe buying insurance (that's what all these 
programs are, essentially) for such items is correct. That is, you are 
making a bet to save an amount of money you could afford to spend if 
you needed to spend it. Insurance is to protect you from risks that 
would ruin, or be a severe set-back in, your life, not from a bump in 
the road.
