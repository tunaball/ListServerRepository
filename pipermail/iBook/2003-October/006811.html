&gt;<i> The one thing that will give you the most efficient use of the battery

</I>&gt;<i> to copy the DVD to the hard drive, then run it from there. That will 
</I>&gt;<i> use
</I>&gt;<i> a LOT less power than using the optical drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Doing this is quite simple. The following refers to OS 9/Classic, but 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> process should be the same in OS X.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To copy the DVD:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Put the DVD in the drive.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Stop Apple DVD Player if it starts to autoplay the DVD.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Use command-I to find out how big the DVD is and ensure that you 
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> enough HD speace to store it.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Open the folder where you want to store the DVD and drag &amp; drop the
</I>&gt;<i> DVD's icon onto that window. Once the DVD is copied, you will get a
</I>&gt;<i> folder containing two more folders, AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Warning: it can easily take 20-40 minutes to copy the DVD, depending on
</I>&gt;<i> how big it is, of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To Set up Apple DVD Player:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Launch Apple DVD Player
</I>&gt;<i> 2. In the preferences, choose the &quot;Advanced Controls&quot; panel. Check &quot;Add
</I>&gt;<i> 'Open VIDEO_TS' menu item to File Menu&quot; and click on OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To Play the DVD:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Launch Apple DVD Player.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Choose &quot;Open VIDEO_TS&quot; from the File menu (or use command-O).
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Navigate to the folder where you dropped the DVD, then open the DVD
</I>&gt;<i> folder.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Click once on the VIDEO_TS *FOLDER* to select it, then click on
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Choose.&quot; Don't OPEN the VIDEO_TS folder. (If you do, you probably 
</I>&gt;<i> won't
</I>&gt;<i> see anything in the open dialog; you will, of course, in the Finder.)
</I>&gt;<i> 5. That should start the DVD. You can use the controller window or the
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard controls as you like. Play around with the Apple DVD Player
</I>&gt;<i> before you leave so that you're familiar with the controls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Battery operation notes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If you have the Energy control panel set to reduce the processor
</I>&gt;<i> speed, you should get a dialog box suggesting that you override that
</I>&gt;<i> feature for better performance. I've found that the DVD player works
</I>&gt;<i> pretty well at the reduced speed, and I'm using a slower (600 mHz 12&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> iBook, so I choose &quot;no.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Reducing the backlight brightness (the F1 key) will give a little
</I>&gt;<i> improvement in battery life.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are four size options:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> command-0 = smallest size. This is REALLY tiny.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> command-1 = half size (320 x 240)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> command-2 = full size (640 x 480)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> command-3 = fill screen. This is actually two different sizes. If you
</I>&gt;<i> choose &quot;Present Video on Screen,&quot; I get the the full 1024 x 768 pixels.
</I>&gt;<i> (As I recall, the 14&quot; iBook also has a 1024 x 768 screen.) If you 
</I>&gt;<i> choose
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Present Video in Viewer,&quot; it will be slightly smaller. You can choose
</I>&gt;<i> either &quot;Present Video in Viewer&quot; or &quot;Present Video on Screen&quot; for any
</I>&gt;<i> size. The &quot;Present Video on Screen&quot; puts the image in the center and
</I>&gt;<i> surrounds it with a black border. (You can easily get to the menus by
</I>&gt;<i> moving the cursor to the top of the screen.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;full size&quot; (640 x 480) will often be a bit sharper than the &quot;fill
</I>&gt;<i> screen&quot; size. That is the actual size of the digital picture. When it 
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> scaled up to 1024 x 768 (or slightly smaller), it may get a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> fuzzier,
</I>&gt;<i> as the pixels must be interpolated. (1024 x 768 is not an integer
</I>&gt;<i> multiple of 640 x 480.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if the smaller size will save much on battery power. If 
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> want to play around with this, you could probably figure it out. One
</I>&gt;<i> caveat: the &quot;power meter&quot; in the control strip doesn't react instantly 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> changes--wait a minute or so before trying to judge whether or not the
</I>&gt;<i> power drain is different.

</I>&gt;<i> I found the best set up to be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> while still connected to mains power start all the programs that you

</I>&gt;<i> stage
</I>&gt;<i> where you will use them (and then minimize them to the dock), as well 
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> having the DVD in the drive and started to at least past the legal 
</I>&gt;<i> bits and
</I>&gt;<i> then put your iBook to sleep (I would also suggest disabling the unused
</I>&gt;<i> network / internet connections in system prefs by unchecking the boxes 
</I>&gt;<i> next
</I>&gt;<i> to each type of interface...airport especially as this will otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> constantly search for new networks and drain battery power).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other notes to consider are that the noise level is really quite high 
</I>&gt;<i> in an
</I>&gt;<i> aircraft and the volume will need to be near full (at least for these 
</I>&gt;<i> poor
</I>&gt;<i> ears of mine!) It may sound counterproductive but I use earplugs that 
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to find in any drug store to cancel the noise of the 
</I>&gt;<i> aircraft
</I>&gt;<i> and then use headphones with the volume at near max to enjoy the 
</I>&gt;<i> movie...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Screen brightness is again dependant on what time of day you fly but 
</I>&gt;<i> it may
</I>&gt;<i> also need to run at full...or you can wait till the lights go down and 
</I>&gt;<i> most
</I>&gt;<i> are sleeping...will help tremendously with brightness and sound volume 
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> well as interruptions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> unless you are going overseas or completely across the country you may 
</I>&gt;<i> find
</I>&gt;<i> that there are many distractions that will require sleeping mode
</I>&gt;<i> again...food and beverage passes of the crew, etc..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have them but it may be worth trying the Bose sound cancelling
</I>&gt;<i> headsets to see if they are worth the money should you travel often.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, you can happily leave your iBook in sleep mode during take off and
</I>&gt;<i> landing (indeed during the entire trip!) as it will not interfere with 
</I>&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;<i> plane electronics in this mode and may be useful when going through 
</I>&gt;<i> security
</I>&gt;<i> zones of airports.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have personally run the movie in full screen mode as it makes it 
</I>&gt;<i> easier on
</I>&gt;<i> the eyes. I have always wondered if the full screen mode or the window 
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> better for battery power and without supporting evidence suggest the 
</I>&gt;<i> full
</I>&gt;<i> screen mode is lower drain. I can only go on the experience of using 
</I>&gt;<i> iTunes
</I>&gt;<i> visual effects with the same issue (full screen vs. window) where I 
</I>&gt;<i> found
</I>&gt;<i> that the window mode required much more battery power due to the need 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> refresh the rest of the desktop and contrast differences as well as any
</I>&gt;<i> other changes to the desktop.
</I>&gt;<i>

Thank you very much for the information guys!
I searched the help file as well as the Apple site and failed to find 
this kind of information that answered all my questions and then some! 
This list is a GREAT source. Armed with this I am now looking forward 
to the trip that much more.

One more question though has been raised about the sleep mode.  I have 
heard that it is best to be in sleep mode for the security checks thus 
making for fast approval but I wonder as to how that affects battery 
life?  Is the sleep mode affected by open apps at sleep time or does it 
not matter?
