Well, Corian isn't conductive and therefore is a poor ground.     Maybe 
your machine is just more susceptible.     I think from recalling my 
Digital Electronics college courses that this could be random noise of 
some kind.   The video ram stores the screen data and if that gets 
wacky on restart you'd expect to get weird effects.    Theoretically 
the buffer should get purged on shutdown before restart but maybe 
that's not happening.    If it's actually something wrong then only 
Apple could fix it by a logic board swap.

  Try making an anti-static mat from a cookie sheet or 
something...remember it's useless without being wired to ground.   If 
it still happens with a good ground then you need a new logic board, 
since the Video chip is soldered in place.   That's too bad, I kind of 
wish Apple would make upgradeable video chips.   Of course this would 
require improvements in heat dissipation.

Some people seem to have an odd effect on electronics.   My dear 
grandmother loved to cook, but she went through 20 stoves in 25 years ! 
   When she turned on her TV it often wouldn't work until I fiddled with 
it.
