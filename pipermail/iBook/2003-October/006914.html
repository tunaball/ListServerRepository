<PRE>Surely I can't be the only one; I'm surprised nobody else has mentioned 
their experiences here (apart from people who had installed the beta 
builds, for one reason or another).

I've installed and am running 10.3 on my good ol' 466 Mhz Key Lime 
iBook. Installation was uneventful, and I've had no problems to speak 
of. Performance is more or less the same; perhaps *slightly* faster, 
certainly no slower. Battery life has been unaffected; I'm still 
getting just a bit more than 4 hours. (Though I'll admit, the battery 
had been removed during the installation. I used the AC Adapter during 
the process, but the battery is still relatively new, and I wanted to 
make sure it's completely discharged for the first few cycles.)

In fact, the only problem I'm having is with the new, slightly 
condensed version of Helvetica that's part of the System; I can't seem 
to select the older version to view messages in Mail. That, and the 
little camera icons in the Internet Explorer &quot;Scrapbook&quot; are drawing 
incorrectly. I can't think of anything else. (I had more trouble 
reinstalling the software for my printer than anything else; and that 
was entirely because I had forgotten that I needed to download the most 
recent version.)

Two caveats: I chose the &quot;Archive and Install&quot; route, instead of 
upgrading my existing files, and I ran Disk Warrior just before the 
installation, to make sure there were no existing problems that could 
have caused complications. (And based on advice I read elsewhere, I ran 
&quot;Repair Permissions&quot; soon after installation.

Anyone else get a package from FedEx on Friday?
