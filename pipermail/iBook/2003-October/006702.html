<PRE>I received my updated Disk Warrior CD, v.3 for OS X (up from DW v.2 
for OS 8 and 9) and promptly ran it on my almost-new (exactly two 
months old) 14.1&quot; iBook 900 with some surprising results. My iBook 
had seemed to be slowing down of late, particularly with my Eudora 
Pro v.6 (paid version) and iCab 2.9.5 with slower uploads and 
downloads.

First, Disk Warrior found 29 percent of my directories out of place 
or needing repair or whatever it's called that's considered &quot;bad&quot;. On 
my old 7300 (G3/400), I don't think DW ever found more than five or 
ten percent and that after several months between uses of Disk 
Warrior. Is this a fairly typical result for Disk Warrior on OS X, 
i.e. to have such a large percentage of the directories/files out of 
order or otherwise needing repair?

Second, the numbers of directories/files/folders on my HD (BTW, I 
have OS 10.2.6) was a factor of many times that of my old OS 8.6 and, 
for a short time, 9.1, well over 350,000 as opposed to perhaps only 
9500 on the old machine. Is this simply because OS X is that much 
more sophisticated than the Classic systems?

Third, I have absolutely no complaints about Disk Warrior's results: 
my machine is noticably and dramatically faster that it was before I 
ran DW. Fast as in lightning, as in when it was brand new two months 
ago. I guess maybe now that I have the new DW CD, I'll be running it 
far more frequently.
