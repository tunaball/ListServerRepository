<PRE>&gt;<i> The *last* thing I want to do is fire up another debate on the relative
</I>&gt;<i> merits of Microsoft and/or software licenses, but I will add that it
</I>&gt;<i> seems many software vendors will willingly sell you a copy of the
</I>&gt;<i> Student and Teacher Edition of Office without any proof whatsoever that
</I>&gt;<i> you meet the licensing requirements. (Amazon has it for just under
</I>&gt;<i> $150.) There's no mechanism for enforcement in the software package,
</I>&gt;<i> either.
</I>
I don't have any personal experience with MS licensing but my 
impression was that they were quite restrictive and very hard line as 
far as who, what and where used their stuff. A few months ago when they 
announced the newest version of Office that is now divided into Pro, 
Standard and Educational, they seemed to have &quot;lost&quot; a lot of the 
restrictions at least as far as the Mac platform is concerned. I 
personally think they have seen the &quot;light&quot; and realize that there are 
just too many options for Mac people and Mac folk are not that willing 
to shell out big bucks for MS. Since then,  I have seen what appears to 
be to be a lot of &quot;looking the other way by MS&quot;. Curious
