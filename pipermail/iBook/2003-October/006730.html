</I>&gt;<i> and replug. Sometimes, I run on battery for awhile and when I get back
</I>&gt;<i> near the ac, plug it back in even if it has not run down to reserve.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any comments of how this does or does not affect battery life? As far

</I>&gt;<i> the battery time may be spent sleeping intermittently. I run it with
</I>&gt;<i> the monitor on max brightness and with airport always on and get about
</I>&gt;<i> 4hours consistently of steady use on battery. I do have the energy

Li-Ion batteries don't degrade gradually; they just lose a large portion of
their capacity rather suddenly.

To keep it alive for as long as possible, try to minimize the number of
discharge/charge cycles as much as possible. In other words: use AC power
whenever possible. Oonly recalibrate your battery when you notice the
battery charge indication being off.

Dead end
You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
from each other.
There is a shovel here.
&gt;<i>take shovel
</I>Taken.  
&gt;<i>eat shovel
</I>You forcefully shove a shovel down your throat, and start choking.

You are dead.
You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.
