<PRE>&gt;<i> From: MRH &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">macmike at famvid.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Here is another question. I have just got this i-mac.
</I>
That's &quot;iMac.&quot;

&gt;<i>  It has Firewire ports
</I>&gt;<i> as well as the usual USB. Anyway, I have a Panasonic AG456 Camcorder 
</I>&gt;<i> that is
</I>&gt;<i> Super VHS. It is equipped with S-video outputs. My JVC S-VHS VCR's are 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> way as well. Now the question. Do any of you know of a Firewire to 
</I>&gt;<i> S-Video
</I>&gt;<i> type of card?
</I>
Even if there was such a card, it wouldn't do you any good. There's no 
spot in an iMac for cards.

What you want is something like the Hollywood DV Bridge or the Canopus 
ADC-100. They cost about $250.

For about $150 more you can just buy a new digital camcoder (look for 
one with &quot;passthrough,&quot; ie an analog-to-digital converter already built 
in).

&gt;<i>  I would like to get rid of my videonics editing equipment and
</I>&gt;<i> use the imac or excuse me the PC at the office to edit some videos.
</I>
If you have access to an iMac with Firewire, there's no way you want to 
use a PC to edit video. Ask the editors of any PC magazine, they'll 
tell you the same thing we'll tell you -- the iMac is *far* superior, 
at least on a consumer level.

&gt;<i>  I plan
</I>&gt;<i> on buy a Firewire DVD+R, -R, +RW, -RW unit. I would love to be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> take
</I>&gt;<i> some of the VHS taped video and bring it in to one of the computers 
</I>&gt;<i> and then
</I>&gt;<i> save it to DVD. What do you think?
</I>
If you mean you have a G4 (flat panel LCD) iMac, then why didn't you 
just buy one with the Superdrive already built in? That way you would 
have gotten iDVD and the whole thing would be a LOT simpler.

If you don't have a G4, your options are severely limited. Basically, 
DVDs are right out, not possible. Don't waste your money buying a DVD-R 
(*not* DVD+R), you can't use it.

What you *can* do is make VCDs, however. These are VHS-quality and 
burned on regular CD-Rs (they play on most, but not all, DVD players). 
To make it easy on yourself, you'll need Toast (about $60-90) in 
addition to the aforementioned ADC unit.

James Lileks, on Apple's iMovie versus XP's Moviemaker:
&quot;Was [my bro-in-law's] machine cheaper? Yes. But time is money; I've 
never had to claw my way through the sodden mess of a corporate website 
looking for the one driver that will let me do what I want to do. I've 
never had to spend a Sunday afternoon trying to understand what iMovie 
wants me to do, because it does what *I* want it to do. He said that 
Moviemaker made him feel stupid, because he couldn't figure out the 
simplest tasks.
I'll say this for his machine, though: if he ever wants to back up that 
3.3 GB movie file on floppy disks, he's all set.&quot;
