I would guess that if they keep replacing the logic board, there must be
another defective component (screen, video cable, power source, ??) that
must be contributing to the logic boards demise. When it does go back, make
sure Apple sticks to it's promise of replacing the iBook. I would also
insist that they give you top priority getting it back to you.

As for backing it up, I would agree with Kim in that they should do it for
you at no cost. 

Even if they do back it up free of charge, a better suggestion would be that
you use Carbon Copy Cloner to duplicate your hard drive. That way when you
get your replacement iBook, all you'll have to do is restore the copy to
your new drive. This way it will be exactly the same as before and you won't
have to go through a long tedious process of reinstalling or getting your
system set back up the way you are used too.
