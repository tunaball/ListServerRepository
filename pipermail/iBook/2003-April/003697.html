<PRE>Apple stores, retail and online, carry a product, iKlear Apple Polish 
which is the only Apple approved product for cleaning the displays. Get 
a bottle ASAP. MacResq.com and Smalldog.com also carry it. Get the kit 
not the bottle, you need the special wipes also. Follow the directions 
for cleaning the display. Do not have high expectations for success. 
The marks are caused by oils and debris your hands have left on the 
keys. They may be permanently etched into the surface.

Until you get the cleaner and forever after, put a CLEAN SOFT cloth or 
paper towel over the key area before you close the lid. There are some 
special leather products made for this purpose costing about $12-15. 
For the same price you can go to a well stocked fabric store and buy 12 
inches of dress weight Ultrasuede in your favorite color which will 
give you a piece 12x44 inches. You can cut it into several pieces that 
fit the keyboard so you can have a clean one, a spare and a dirty one 
at all times.

If you use the paper towel, get the soft fluffy ones. In a pinch a 
CLEAN sheet of paper will work also. Be sure you fold if necessary to 
allow the hook to latch the lid.

If you are unable to clean the screen with the cleaner, the next option 
is expensive. You can call MacResq @ 1-866-Mac-Repair to see if the 
process they use on the Wallstreets will work on the iBook. Here is a 
url for more info on the Wallstreet process

<A HREF="http://www.powerbookresq.com/polarizer.html">http://www.powerbookresq.com/polarizer.html</A>

It costs  $299 which includes all shipping costs, they send you a box 
and packing instructions and I think they try to get it back 24 hours 
after they get it.  The phone# and URL is also good for any non 
warranty laptop repairs. They send the boxes, packing instructions and 
pick up the ibook on day 1, within 24 hours of okaying the repairs, the 
laptop is shipped back fixed. The cost of shipping, box and estimate is 
$99. Same day pickup is $149

Good luck. I hope the screen is not etched.
