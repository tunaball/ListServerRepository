<PRE>&gt;<i> I thought it had something to do with the power on keeping it warmer 
</I>&gt;<i> so the
</I>&gt;<i> ink would (or wouldn't) get gummed up due to disuse. On the other hand 
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> probably just imagined the whole thing. Or maybe my brain got gummed 
</I>&gt;<i> up thru
</I>&gt;<i> disuse.

You may be thinking about the older Epson inkjets. They came out with 
the smallest ink drop of any brand and it was so tiny that if they were 
not used on a regular basis, the nozzles would clog and you couldn't 
use the rest of the ink without buying new nozzles or visiting the 
repair store, etc. Since then, Epson has changed the ink a lot, the 
nozzles are still tiny but the problem seems to be gone.

Back then, people tried all kinds of voodoo and magic incantations to 
keep the ink from gumming the nozzles but there was no sure cure except 
to use the printer frequently whether you needed to or not. Using the 
cleaning cycle daily seemed to help but used a lot of ink.

I recently purchased an Epson C-60 refurb because I needed a cheap 
printer immediately and it was the cheapest I found. I was willing to 
settle for a disposable printer to get a particular job printed. I am 
very happy with my $40 printer. I use it when I need it and forget to 
shut it off when I don't. The only complaint I have is the printer 
utility which is supposed to tell me how much ink is left, does not 
appear to be very reliable. It said I had lots of red ink left but that 
tank was empty.
