<PRE>It does sound like ye olde logic board problem. My husband's 600MHz iBook
went back to Apple about 6(?) months ago and they replaced the logic board.
Now it's acting up again. Does anyone know if they'll replace the
replacement?

As for Bill's original question, my own 600MHz iBook had a video problem as
well as a broken hinge and top cover about 3 years ago. It wasn't under
warranty, so I bought a new hinge and case on eBay, dug up some take-apart
instructions (this was before they became easy to find online) from someone
on this list, I think, and figured I'd troubleshoot the video once I had the
thing apart. I suspected I'd need to buy a particular replacement part for
the video (can't remember the name of the part), but it turned out that the
connector had just come unplugged. I plugged it back in, replaced the hinge
and plastics, and I'm still using that iBook.

Sigh. It looks like I'm going to have to hand my iBook over to my husband. I
somehow doubt that Apple's going to fix his, and I can't see putting more
money into that old machine and since I just bought a brand-new MacBook Pro
(see me kicking and screaming), we can't even begin to afford yet another
new machine. But I'll *miss* my iBook--it has been my favorite Mac ever, in
a long career of Macs!
