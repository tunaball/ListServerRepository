This sounds a LOT like a bad logic board. These are the same symptoms my
wife's dual USB 500mhz iBook had starting about 3 or 4 weeks ago. I have
researched this issue at length. According to my research you should try to
use the external video connector and connect it to an external monitor, if
that doesn't work then it is a bad logic board.

Apple had a problem with these logic boards and had a replacement program
for them even if they weren't under AppleCare. But that has since expired.
There are a number of folks with this same issue who have posted on the
apple web site under the discussions area. Seems like these iBooks have been
&quot;dropping like flies&quot; lately. I considered replacing the logic board but
couldn't find one that had more than a 90 day warranty and there certainly
weren't any new ones available, considering that I decided to cut my losses
and sell it for parts.

Somewhere in my research I ran across more than one person who were told by
Apple Techs on the phone that Apple considers the lifespan of *Books to be 3
years. I personally would expect they would last longer than that too, and I
know that many Apple products do last longer than that. I guess the 3 years
is a corporate policy though.

We are currently scraping some extra cash together to buy my wife a new
iBook, hopefully we can get one of the G4 iBooks before they are
discontinued.

Good luck!
