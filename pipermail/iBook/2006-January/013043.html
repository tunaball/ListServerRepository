I am running GuestPC on my Mac mini 1.32 GHz, however previously I ran 
it on my iBook G3 700 Mhz.  Now I do not own Windows XP, so my 
experience with it was with Windows 98.  I also own Virtual PC which I 
have also run on both computers.  I actually think that the difference 
is not worth the additional price commanded by Virtual PC.  GuestPC is 
up to version 1.7 and they have all been free upgrades.  I used GuestPC 
when it was called something else and did not run on OSX but it has 
always worked very well.  When they went to OSX the upgrade price was 
very reasonable, less than 50.00.  Try to get that with VirtualPC!  All 
of the step upgrades have been free.  The more memory you have the 
better it works.  I do not find it all that slow, as it runs all of the 
programs I have thrown at it without a problem.  They have done a great 
job of squashing bugs as they arise.  Many people today want SPEED.  It 
is still an emulator, and as such it will not be as fast as running in 
on native equipment.  But it is great to say to a Windows fan, that to a 
Mac &quot;Windows is just another program&quot;!

Hope this helps,
Robert Newman
