<PRE>Are we sure that there will be a new ibook or is the MacBook taking the
place of both line of notebooks?


Also, these intel macs will not be running windows according to this:

<A HREF="http://www.betanews.com/article/XP_Wont_Run_on_Intel_MacBook_iMac/1137003330">http://www.betanews.com/article/XP_Wont_Run_on_Intel_MacBook_iMac/1137003330</A>

With the announcement of the first Intel based Macs yesterday, many users
have rejoiced in being able to dual-boot both Mac OS X and Windows.
Unfortunately, this is not the case; due to Apple's use of the extensible
firmware interface (EFI) rather than BIOS, current Windows releases will not
run on the systems. [...] 
  With the switch to Intel processors, Apple also moved from Open Firmware
to EFI, which is an updated BIOS specification developed by Intel. Advanced
features include the ability to boot into an EFI shell and run diagnostics
and power up the CPU into a fully functional state immediately. [...] 
  Intel initially deployed EFI as part of its Itanium architecture. As such,
Microsoft only included support for the BIOS replacement in its IA64 and
later x64 operating systems. While Microsoft plans to add EFI support in
32-bit versions of Windows Vista, a final release isn't due until the end of
the year. 
  Microsoft's 64-bit versions of Windows will also not work despite
supporting EFI, because Apple's Intel platform is strictly 32-bit at the
moment.

Subject: [iBook] Re: Apple Announces Intel MacBook Pro

I'm excited about the new MacBook, but not the name. &quot;MacBook&quot; doesn't
seem to roll off the tongue like PowerBook does (did?) People have
told me that it was renamed out of respect for the PowerBooks, but I
have trouble seeing it that way. The PowerBook name has been in the
family for 16 years now, since October 1991 with the original
PowerBook 100. Since then, it has been on every portable (save the
beloved iBook) up until now. That includes the transition from 68k to
PPC, so why not PPC to x86?

First the Happy Mac on bootup, then the PowerPC chip, now the
PowerBook name ... what will become of it all? (^;

I sincerely hope they do not rename the iBook. If it becomes the
&quot;iMacBook&quot; I'm going to throw myself off a bridge!

Yours in sarcasm,
