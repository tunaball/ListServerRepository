<PRE>When I bought my first Airport base station (the original graphite model) it
was pretty much the only one that included a 56K modem. In those days I was
happy as a pig in you-know-what that I could have a 56K connection to the
Internet and actually have multiple computers online. 
 
Now I have a Linksys router and see no reason to ever go back to Apple if
the Internet connection is broadband, with the exception of the Airport
Express. The latest version of the Airport Express firmware and the latest
version of iTunes supports sending music wirelessly to MULTIPLE Airport
Express units in the house at the SAME TIME, and that is whether you use
iTunes for Windows or Mac. It is really cool. 
 
Plus the Airport Express makes a decent travel router when you're on the
road.

Perhaps someone could enlighten my about why they buy Airport Extreme 
base stations in the first place? I've never once purchased one of 
Apple$ base stations, electing instead to buy a much cheaper wireless 
router from Netgear, DLlink, Belkin, etc. I don't think I've paid 
more than $10 (after rebates) for any of my routers, which are 
typically the &quot;draw&quot; items at heavy discount in the weekly compusa, 
bestbuy, officemax, or Staples ad circulars. 
 
Is there some great feature to the Airport station that I'm not aware 
of?
