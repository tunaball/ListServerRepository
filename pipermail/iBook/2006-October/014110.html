<PRE>
Without wanting to be provoking, if I was interested in an iBook, I wouldn't buy
this. It's nothing personal, but such a purchase would leave the buyer very
vulnerable.

I don't want to impugn your character, Buddy Brannan, but the list doesn't
really know anything about you. I think it'd be foolish to buy the ibook, and
I'd question why you don't put it on ebay, where there is at least a modicum of
protection for both buyers and sellers...

Regards,

&gt;<i> Hi y'all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been sort of lurking...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, about a year and a half ago, I got an iBook dual USB off  
</I>&gt;<i> eBay, mostly because I wanted to play with Tiger generally and  
</I>&gt;<i> Voiceover in particular. Well, as it happens, this machine's just a  
</I>&gt;<i> bit too slow running Voiceover and what-not for me to comfortably  
</I>&gt;<i> use; which is to say, I'll be getting a faster one sometime.  
</I>&gt;<i> Meantime, If anyone needs the better part of one of these, I'd let  
</I>&gt;<i> this one go pretty cheap, including a copy of OSX Tiger (full DVD).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I say most of a system is this, and why someone could get  
</I>&gt;<i> a good deal. The track pad doesn't seem to click. The button presses,  
</I>&gt;<i> but while the mouse cursor moves, it ddoesn't seem to click. I  
</I>&gt;<i> suspect it has something to do with the fact that the lid doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i> latch, either. Both of these things did work, but now they don't.  
</I>&gt;<i> Probably easy for someone, but not for me, and I really didn't notice  
</I>&gt;<i> until I thought about unloading this thing and having someone check.  
</I>&gt;<i> Since I'm blind (which is why I was using Voiceover), I had no reason  
</I>&gt;<i> to use the mouse or complain about its unresponsiveness.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That said, this machine's got 320 MB RAM, a 20GB hard drive, combo  
</I>&gt;<i> drive ($X CD burner/24X CDROM/I dunno what speed it plays DVD's at),  
</I>&gt;<i> Airport card, ethernet and modem. Also an after-market battery  
</I>&gt;<i> charger, and the battery, last I used it, lasted well over three  
</I>&gt;<i> hours with the power savings set to &quot;better energy savings&quot;. Mind  
</I>&gt;<i> you, this is with the audio going nonstop (because it was talking).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, the case has some rough edges from the previous owner.  
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the i key feels a bit crooked, but all the keys work anyway.  
</I>&gt;<i> Far as I can tell, and I'm typing on it now, those (with the latch  
</I>&gt;<i> and the mouse button issue) are the only gotchas with this thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It will come to you with a fresh install of OSX, so you don't have to  
</I>&gt;<i> deal with all the junk I had on it. Else I can just wipe the thing  
</I>&gt;<i> and let you do your own install. Whichever.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Knowing how much of a show stopper the whole mouse thing can be for  
</I>&gt;<i> people, I was looking to get around $150. Well, maybe *way* around.  
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure how unreasonable this is, so someone can feel free to make  
</I>&gt;<i> an offer if you need pieces and parts. Since it seems to be a big  
</I>&gt;<i> deal on eBay for some reason, I cound two rubber stoppers on the LCD  
</I>&gt;<i> panel and four rubber feet on the bottom.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
