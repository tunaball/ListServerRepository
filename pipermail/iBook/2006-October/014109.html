&gt;<i> Hi y'all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been sort of lurking...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, about a year and a half ago, I got an iBook dual USB off eBay, 
</I>&gt;<i> mostly because I wanted to play with Tiger generally and Voiceover in 
</I>&gt;<i> particular. Well, as it happens, this machine's just a bit too slow 
</I>&gt;<i> running Voiceover and what-not for me to comfortably use; which is to 
</I>&gt;<i> say, I'll be getting a faster one sometime. Meantime, If anyone needs 
</I>&gt;<i> the better part of one of these, I'd let this one go pretty cheap, 
</I>&gt;<i> including a copy of OSX Tiger (full DVD).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I say most of a system is this, and why someone could get a 
</I>&gt;<i> good deal. The track pad doesn't seem to click. The button presses, 
</I>&gt;<i> but while the mouse cursor moves, it ddoesn't seem to click. I suspect 
</I>&gt;<i> it has something to do with the fact that the lid doesn't latch, 
</I>&gt;<i> either. Both of these things did work, but now they don't. Probably 
</I>&gt;<i> easy for someone, but not for me, and I really didn't notice until I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought about unloading this thing and having someone check. Since I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> blind (which is why I was using Voiceover), I had no reason to use the 
</I>&gt;<i> mouse or complain about its unresponsiveness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, this machine's got 320 MB RAM, a 20GB hard drive, combo 
</I>&gt;<i> drive ($X CD burner/24X CDROM/I dunno what speed it plays DVD's at), 
</I>&gt;<i> Airport card, ethernet and modem. Also an after-market battery 
</I>&gt;<i> charger, and the battery, last I used it, lasted well over three hours 
</I>&gt;<i> with the power savings set to &quot;better energy savings&quot;. Mind you, this 
</I>&gt;<i> is with the audio going nonstop (because it was talking).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, the case has some rough edges from the previous owner. 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the i key feels a bit crooked, but all the keys work anyway. Far 
</I>&gt;<i> as I can tell, and I'm typing on it now, those (with the latch and the 
</I>&gt;<i> mouse button issue) are the only gotchas with this thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It will come to you with a fresh install of OSX, so you don't have to 
</I>&gt;<i> deal with all the junk I had on it. Else I can just wipe the thing and 
</I>&gt;<i> let you do your own install. Whichever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Knowing how much of a show stopper the whole mouse thing can be for 
</I>&gt;<i> people, I was looking to get around $150. Well, maybe *way* around. 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure how unreasonable this is, so someone can feel free to make an 
</I>&gt;<i> offer if you need pieces and parts. Since it seems to be a big deal on 
</I>&gt;<i> eBay for some reason, I cound two rubber stoppers on the LCD panel and 
</I>&gt;<i> four rubber feet on the bottom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Buddy. if you still have the iBook, I'd like to get it.
