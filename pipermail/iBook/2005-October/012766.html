will most likely get key mars from oil and dirt on your hands. They  
also give you a screen cleaner and a taste of there liquid cleaner. I  
just use a damp paper towel rub lightly.

</I>It's there now

&gt;<i> Online at the apple site, I read that they'll price match up to 10%

</I>&gt;<i> favorite
</I>&gt;<i> books to recommend for my new life with OSX and Tiger and all the  
</I>&gt;<i> great app
</I>&gt;<i> goodies Apple includes?
</I>OS X the tiger addition for all the basics but over all, I have found  
just working with the machine is great. The GUI is much more  
intuitive and flows well. The help section is very good on basics and  
will really do a lot for you, if you follow it. Find a few sites were  
newbies are treated well. This is a pretty good one. The Apple boards  
especially late at night,  get some real good posts and answers. Just  
keep the beast underneath asleep, if you want to learn how it works,  
well UNIX is for you. I would use the OS X tiger book and wait for  
awhile and then decide where you need to get a little more  
understanding, that way you can narrow the need and the cash down.  
Their really starting to  get this going.
Have fun, I am sure you will enjoy it for many years to come.
Geoff
