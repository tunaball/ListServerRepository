<PRE>Hi Mike,

Last fall we stayed at a Country Inn and Suites somewhere in Kansas.  
I asked about Internet connectivity and they said it was all  
wireless. I told them we didn't have wireless connectivity in my  
wife's dual USB iBook so they lent me a D-Link bridge that looked  
very similar to that one. I don't know the exact model # they lent me  
but all I did was plug it into the ethernet port and we were online.  
There was no configuration necessary.

The only drawback to it that I saw was that you have to plug it into  
AC power for it to work. I don't think you could put batteries in it.  
That wasn't really a problem in a hotel room, but could be a problem  
at home. So with this device you would be wireless as far as network  
connectivity goes but not as far as power goes.

I don't know what price you found this device for but you may want to  
look into finding an older airport card. I have seen them on the mac  
swap list for around $75 before. If you had an airport card you  
wouldn't need any external devices or external power.

good luck!

Kevin
