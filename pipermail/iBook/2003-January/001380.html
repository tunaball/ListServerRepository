I seem to recall Joe saying that the drive can't be seen by any disk
utilities. That makes it difficult to re-install...

I don't know much about the open firmware, but is it possible he did some
wacky open firmware thing. I've heard that removing RAM will reset open
firmware. Perhaps he should try that... But I will admit, this is just a
guess.

Or the hard drive could have just died then.

Is the iBook still under warranty? If so - call Applecare.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To help in the problem solving can you ask him if he had activated the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;I was tinkering with the terminal in bed one day. I let myself get
