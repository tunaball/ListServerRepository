I used the numbers present in government documents to create a chart of 
the US debt from World War II until the middle of the Clinton Era. The 
numbers spiked during the Reagan Years and the debt was definitely 
being lowered and approaching zero during the Clinton years. Remember, 
the balanced budged and zero deficit?

A prosperous nation is not taxing its people and spending 30 percent of 
that money to pay off foreign debt.  If the debt is zero, then taxes 
can be reduced accordingly. We cannot forever try to finance the world 
and retain our way of life. We also have to deal with the CEOs among us 
who are corrupt and leading us into bankruptcy.

During the present Bush Administration, and it is not entirely his 
fault due to the attack on our country, the deficit will reach 
astronomical heights, the largest in our history and the debt will 
climb to the highest ever. Our great-great-grandchildren will be taxed 
to pay these debts just as we were and are still taxed to pay the bills 
from generations past.

Social Security has become a dead issue but behind all of the fog 
presented in the last decade, the problem exists that SS has no money 
and that there may not be enough of our grand children working to 
support with their taxes the money we expect to be spent on us by 
Social Security.

---
I propose that all elections for public office be advanced two years so 
that anyone elected to office can serve a two year jail term for the 
crimes they are about to commit and that we will probably find hard to 
prove.
