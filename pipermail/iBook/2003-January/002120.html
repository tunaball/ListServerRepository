<PRE>&gt;<i>I used FrontPage on my old PC -- but now that I have a new iBook, I'm 
</I>&gt;<i>not sure what program to use to create webpages. I know a bit of html 
</I>&gt;<i>and don't want a SUPER simple template-driven program like earthlink's 
</I>&gt;<i>Click-n-Build which is way too limiting, but I don't want to write all 
</I>&gt;<i>the html myself, either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Any suggestions?

It all depends upon how much you want to spend. Freeway and Dreamweaver 
are the top web-page creation programs, but neither is cheap. There are 
some shareware programs--check 

<A HREF="http://www.versiontracker.com/">http://www.versiontracker.com/</A>

and search on &quot;HTML.&quot; I know that there is one called &quot;Pagespinner,&quot; 
another &quot;HTML Creator&quot; and a very simple program called Jesse6 (named for 
the author's daughter). There is also something called &quot;WebToys,&quot; which 
is a set of templates and scripts for saving AppleWorks word-processing 
documents as web pages. It works reasonably well, though there are some 
problems. AppleWorks by itself can save a document in HTML. If you want 
to do HTML manually, BBEdit Lite is a great text editor. The full-blown 
BBEdit has even more features, but the Lite version is free. There is a 
set of HTML tools for BBEdit that does some of the  common tags. (E.g., 
you select some text and choose the &quot;italics&quot; tool and it puts the 
italics tags on either side of the text.)

The cheapest way would be to use Netscape, which has a built-in module 
called &quot;Composer&quot; that will do web pages, though I don't know  if it will 
do all that you want. You may have a version of Netscape on your iBook. 
See what version it is. Even Version 4.x had Composer. The latest 
version, Netscape 7.01, is free, if you can last through a long 
download--something like 18-19 MB. For me, that was over an hour and a 
half with a v.90 connection. At one time, you could get the original 7.00 
version on CD, but the 7.01 version has some bug fixes that are 
important. I don't know if you can get it on CD yet. Check Netscape's 
site. 

You may be able to find a copy of Adobe PageMill 2 or Claris HomePage 3 
for sale. I haven't tried PageMill, but HomePage seems to work under OS 
9.2.2; I haven't tried it in the Classic mode of OS X.
