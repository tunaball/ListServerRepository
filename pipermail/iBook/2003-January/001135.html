ON THREAD &#151; 
I have a graphite clamshell iBook running OS 9.2.  (also have a 7300 Power Mac
&amp; [temporarily] an iMac).  I'd like to add to the collection a small 12-inch
travel book (ice book?) running OSX/Classic.  Except that when I'm running
Classic on the iMac the System folder scares me.  It looks as though X and
Classic overlap in the System.  I see a lot of blank documents, etc., which
probably belong to OSX.  I'm afraid to be as bold as I can be with the
stand-alone OS9.2 on my iBook.  

I sprang for the $20 machine-independent install of OS 9.2 from Apple (Jaguar
offer).  On an ice book, for example, would it make any sense to use a
partitioned disk with OS9.2 installed on one half (complete system) and OSX
installed on the other half (complete system)?  Does such a plan make sense? 
I realize that a good-sized hard disk is necessary for that.  

Another idea has crossed my mind:  This is a wildly hypothetical question &#151;
With the clamshell iBook, could I plug in a firewire exterior hard disk and
install OSX on it?  That way I could use either system at will without buying
an iBook with a larger disk and the two systems would be completely separate..
 (Somewhere in the back of this non-technical mind the word &quot;firmware&quot; keeps
echoing.)  Thanks for your advice

OFF THREAD &#151; 
Eric B. Richardson wrote [in answer to J.P.Moore:
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  Your real bias was evident when you decided to post the utterly ignorant
</I>crap about Clinton being the most effective president, not just more than
Bush, but more than any president in American history.  What a load. You act
like a teenager with a crush.   &lt;&lt;&lt;

Quoting accurately from J.P.Moore:  &quot;he was the most effective president in
our lifetime.&quot;   Not all of American history.  How old is E.B.Richardson?  He
sounds young enough to be limited to about 3 presidents in his lifetime.  For
myself, I could argue that Roosevelt was the most effective prez in mine!  But
if I limit the field to post-WWII incumbents, as J.P.Moore probably means to
do, Clinton looks good, better and probably best.  (That's real bias.)
