The most copies of a system folder I ever saw where on a hard drive 
back in the days when a system folder and application would fit on a 
floppy. 16 applications and 16 system folders were copied to one drive. 
The mac ran a lot smoother after I deleted the extra systems. I have 
heard of even more being on one drive.

The last user group I went to the 'big consultant' was recommending 
people not delete their old applications from X when they though they 
were damaged and to just copy the new one to the drive. He also said 
that it doesn't hurt to have multiple systems on an X drive. He then 
gave everyone his phone number.

I haven't tested X for the validity of this suggestion nor have I read 
much about it. But even IF it is ok to do so, I think telling a group 
of newbies to do this is little more than fishing for business since 
they won't know how to handle the inevitable conflicts, which copy of 
XXXX, the good one or the bad one, just opened? etc.

I noticed while listening to the Capital Gang on CNN rant on pro and 
con about UM's 20 points for Blacks that not one of the CG on CNN is 
Black.
