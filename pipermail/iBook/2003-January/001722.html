Zeroing the drive means that each bit of info is overwritten by a zero 
or a 1, sometimes the process makes several passes writing first a one 
and then a zero. The object is to eliminate all traces of your data 
from the drive. You can do this on any drive but the start up drive.

In Disk Utility in Jaguar select any drive but the startup drive by 
clicking on the upper icon and not the volume names. The option button 
will become available. Click on it and the checkbox for zeroing the 
drive will now be available.

Admittedly I have not zeroed any drive using X but I do believe this 
will work.

I have zeroed drives using 9 and it does take a long time but I had 
sold the Macs and had another to use so the length of time was not much 
of a factor to me.

You would want to zero the drive when you sell it if you have data that 
you don't want resurrected or if you are giving a floppy to Congress... 
  If you buy a used drive you would probably want to do the same to 
eliminate nasty stuff and any incriminating evidence that might be on 
the drive and land you in jail.

I noticed while listening to the Capital Gang on CNN rant on pro and 
con about UM's 20 points for Blacks that not one of the CG on CNN is 
Black.
