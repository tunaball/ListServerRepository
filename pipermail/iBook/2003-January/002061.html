<PRE>There is a place I go a couple of times a week where I use my iBook. As 
soon as I open it, new mail downloads because somebody in the building 
has a wireless network.

So - are you saying that if I don't PREVENT that from happening, it is 
your opinion that I'm breaking the law?

That seems a bit like saying that if I lower my car window and hear the 
music from somebody else's radio, that I've &quot;stolen&quot; it.

I'm thrilled that Long Beach, California, where I live - is providing 
areas of the city that have free public wireless access. One 4 square 
block area - a big downtown area - is already up and running and 
they'll be setting up others soon. They'll have a portal page that will 
have advertising for businesses right there in the area - this seems 
like a great idea to me. If I'm sitting in one place and want to know 
where to go buy something - I'd look at that page to see if there was 
somewhere right in the vicinity - it is very high quality advertising 
space, imo, and I bet the city will come out ahead on this.

Starbucks is everywhere - but I think t-mobile is a bit expensive for 
us regular people to use their service very often. I'd think that 
competing coffeehouses would find it to their advantage to offer some 
level of free or less expensive service. Hope that'll happen one of 
these days.
