</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>The first rule of troubleshooting is: don't panic
The second is: keep it simple

The two most important facts in this scenario are: a) the blinking folder
and b) the drive doesn't mount when the computer is booted with another
disk.

This screams disk damage of some kind. It could be that the driver has
become damaged or the drive might be dead. Less likely is that the drive
cable could have come loose or be damaged. I seriously doubt firmware simply
because the computer was bootable from another computer. I'm curious why two
external drives were used and not the iBook's CD.

That he was playing around in the terminal, that some keys might have been
pressed inadvertently are probably not important. Being electronic devices,
computers most often fail when we try to start them up.
