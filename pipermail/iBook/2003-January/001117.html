<PRE>According to this recent c-net article .. Apple is to charge 50$ for the
next bundle of updates for iMovie, iPhoto and iDVD ..

And it royaly pisses me off (excuse my french ) ..

Noy because I have to pay for something .. But because I am loosing &quot;the
edge&quot; ... Something I had so much fun laughing into wintel users faces and
used to get people interested in apple &quot;it comes with all that great stuff
free&quot; .. And that not only meant free when you buy the machine .. But free
for the rest of the time ..

Now .. I understand that companies need to make serious money to not follow
the path of united ...


But please not buy giving up in what they were great for ..


Lets see ... Jag upgrade was already a big hick up .. 129$ .. Woa .. And it
gives me some great stuff .. But I also keep seeing that turning beach ball
way too often .. So I am actually counting on upgrades (bug fixes) .. Will
they charge for them too one day (not that I can even think about
downloading a 50 MB heap these days)

Mac.com  .. 99$ .. Less the stellar performance .. I kept it because I like
my mac.com address and I got it for 49$ .. But I will most likey not
continue come next september .. The address is spam infested and I am
dissapointed by the performance .. Uploads to iDisc take way to long .. And
I do not mean mere upload time .. But processing time ..

Now .. For those 3 I APPs .. I do need iMovie ...  .. Iphoto is a nice
thingie dingie .. But seems to be geared toward the private person .. I
managed to fill up the library with 2300 pics in the last 3 months .. And it
is getting way slow on me .. I know .. Some people may say that is
profeessionel use .. Thus it is the wrong app ..

I am actually happy with iDVD .. So I wonder what the upgrade would be ..

The #1 thing I want for iMovie and iDVD is 16:9 / widescreen support !!!
yeah 

I fear with all the above .. Apple will become more microsoft alike and
prone to piracy ..
