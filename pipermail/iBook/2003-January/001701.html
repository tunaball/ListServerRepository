<PRE>Hi everyone,

Mark's email (important part below) reminded me that I wanted to ask 
this list about experiences with airport cables.

My original iBoook, purchased in August 2001, was sent back after a 
couple of months because the airport cable was being pinched by the 
hinge - the signal was OK when the hinge was only half-open but lost 
when it was fully open.  The cable couldn't be replaced for some 
reason so I was sent a new iBook.  This iBook showed symptoms of the 
same problem, and after a year the cable completely failed.  I can 
now do email from my bed only because the base station is under the 
bed.  (Yes, this is the iBook with the stinky keyboard.)

I know some other iBooks were having similar hinge vs cable problems. 
Did the mess ever get resolved?  Has the hinge been redesigned?  Are 
new hinge-resistant cables available?

Thanks,

Rosie


&gt;<i>Well, I went ahead and replaced the drive myself. In the process of
</I>&gt;<i>disassembling it, I discovered that the lead to the AirPort antenna had been
</I>&gt;<i>crushed between two points where the case came together. I had been using
</I>&gt;<i>AirPort and it worked fine. A couple months later my AirPort connection
</I>&gt;<i>started to fail. I had to be within 10 feet of the base station to get a
</I>&gt;<i>signal. I knew what the problem was but how the heck would I be able to
</I>&gt;<i>prove I didn't crush the antenna lead?!?!?!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Well, I called Apple and they had me send it in for repair. Rather than go
</I>&gt;<i>through trying to explain what I found, I decided my best option would be to
</I>&gt;<i>play dumb, reinstall the old drive, and send it in. Thankfully it was
</I>&gt;<i>repaired, no questions asked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>When I put the 40GB drive back in, I saw that they had indeed replaced the
</I>&gt;<i>lead that had been crushed.
</I>&gt;<i>
