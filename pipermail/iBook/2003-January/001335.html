<PRE>Karsten,

The others should have won you over by now...if not...go airport. You will
wander around the area with a silly smile on your face in pleasure from the
freedom it allows. Cables are ugly and belong in the Windoze world.

There is a document around on how to set up an airport network on the apple
site called &quot;designing airport networks 2.pdf&quot; but I can't seem to find the
link right now, if you don't find it then I can send it to you off list if
you wish. (1.3 MB in size).

There are sure to be other chapters of books on the subject as well if you
search a good computer book store in your area or online.

HTH,

P.S. If I didn't mention it before...go airport.

Richard

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am almost sure that this topic has been dealed with dozens of times around
</I>&gt;<i> here. But I am new to MacOS X and to the iBook and I need some advice about
</I>&gt;<i> Airport.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, the first question is (this may make all further ones obsolete):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a brief description of Apple's Airport Technology available?
</I>&gt;<i> I would be glad to hear about websites and PDFs as well as books.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I once used David Pogue's article titled &quot;How to connect two Macs&quot; to deal
</I>&gt;<i> with this matter back in the days of Apple Talk.
</I>&gt;<i> This article was available for free somewhere in the web and it was taken
</I>&gt;<i> from one of his formidable books
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I don't use AppleTalk anymore but would like to connect an eMac with an
</I>&gt;<i> iBook.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there such a detailed explanation available for these new devices like
</I>&gt;<i> that one of David Pogue?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am still figuring out wether I should opt for an ethernet connection or
</I>&gt;<i> for a wireless network using two airport cards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the ethernet connection I would need a hub and a special cable.
</I>&gt;<i> For Airport I would need two cards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, both options aren't cheap and I would be very unlucky if I had opted for
</I>&gt;<i> the wrong one.
</I>&gt;<i>
