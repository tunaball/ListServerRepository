<PRE>Yesterday I bought an Airport card for my Clamshell iBook and a Linksys 
wireless router. I hooked it up with the uplink port to my Asante 
router ( broadband internet ). Since I am not useing the Linksys' 
router function I had no setup to do. I turned it on and clicked on 
Airport setup in the utilities folder on my laptop. It worked 
perfectly. Using the Linksys saved me $100 over the Apple base station. 
I am now writing this from the comfort of my couch. There has been no 
speed hit for going wireless. I have no problems with with my laptop, 
it is a joy to use. I just thought you might like to hear my success 
story.

    BTW, I also setup my wifes IBM Thinkpad to be wireless and that 
works properly also. However I had to install software and reboot to 
activate it. I then had to reboot and insert the PC Card after windows 
started to boot and before it finished booting ( straight from the 
instructions!). After Windows detected the card, it searched and pulled 
a driver from the Linksys folder ( from the software install in step 
one) and then rebooted again to activate the PC Card. 2 software 
installs and 3 reboots to do what my Apple did with one click. And now 
she has a thing sticking out the side of her laptop to get damaged when 
she's transporting it.

So sip your wine in celebration of your good decision making skills!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) You are on a discussion forum for people who are seeking help for 
</I>&gt;<i> their iBook problems... They won't post every time they have something 
</I>&gt;<i> go right with their computer. So, the overwhelming majority of threads 
</I>&gt;<i> are about problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) There are dozens, maybe hundreds of people subscribed to this list, 
</I>&gt;<i> a fair number owning multiple computers. The chances that *one* of 
</I>&gt;<i> them will have some problem on a given day is HUGE. So, you'll see 
</I>&gt;<i> several messages per day, even though the rate of problems is low.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Psychologically, our brains are more attuned to noticing and 
</I>&gt;<i> retaining negative information (because, evolutionarily, that's the 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff that will kill you). That is, negative information gets our 
</I>&gt;<i> attention more readily. Reading  a list of predominantly negative 
</I>&gt;<i> information like this will be more psychologically arousing than other 
</I>&gt;<i> lists you may read*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, keep those things in mind while you read a list like this. It 
</I>&gt;<i> ain't so bad as it seems and you may pick up a tip which allows you to 
</I>&gt;<i> head off a problem before it occurs.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> *except, of course, for *those* lists! LOL!
