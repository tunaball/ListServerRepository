Oops. He was elected by one vote on the Supreme Court who ignored the 
Constitutional provisions for just the sort of problem encountered in a 
problematic vote. There was no need to bypass the Constitution when it 
provided a clear method of handling a disputed election. Why where 
these Republican Judges so interested in rushing the election process 
and upholding a tainted vote count?

Please note that our country is so magnificent that it can survive 
these tainted votes and a rush to judgment by the Supreme Court. And Al 
Gore has proven himself a worth American by constantly referring to 
George Bush as the elected President. In other countries an individual 
in a similar position might lead a coup.

Granted that the final outcome might have been the same had the 
recounts been allowed and the Supreme Court acknowledge that the 
Constitution was prepared to deal with a disputed election. But 
wouldn't that have been a better outcome than the present one where 
Republicans deliberately used political force to create the outcome?

I propose that all elections for public office be advanced two years so 
that anyone elected to office can serve a two year jail term for the 
crimes they are about to commit and that we will probably find hard to 
prove.
