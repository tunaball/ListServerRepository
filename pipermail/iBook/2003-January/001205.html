The proper action at that point is to reconnect the camera and drag the 
icon to the trash. Then disconnect. Usually it doesn't do any harm 
since you haven't really modified any files on the card which is where 
the damage might occur if you have unsaved files.

My first suggestion would be to trash the preferences for your download 
software and try again. This might resolve the problem.

Second, use a third part device that holds your card, such as a Zio USB 
adapter. Maybe a friend has one and you can try your card in his unit.

Next, buy or borrow a similar card and try taking some pictures on that 
and then download them, if you can. If you can your card may be corrupt 
and need reformatting. If you can, download your pictures to a friends 
Mac and copy them over to yours.

If your card doesn't work on other computers, and you might try several 
just to be sure, you probably corrupted the card and need to reformat 
it inside the camera.

If using another card in your camera doesn't work, you either have a 
cord problem or a camera problem.

It really isn't that easy to damage a camera or card by ejecting it too 
early and I doubt that you did that. More than likely you corrupted 
your software preferences.

I propose that all elections for public office be advanced two years so 
that anyone elected to office can serve a two year jail term for the 
crimes they are about to commit and that we will probably find hard to 
prove.
