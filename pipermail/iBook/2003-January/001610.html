Keep us informed of what is going on... :)

You sound like you have the same luck I did when working on my old 
sports cars in my early twenties. I always ended up with a few left 
over parts, which made me wonder who designed cars that had more parts 
than they needed, and my father would always point to the rotor I left 
out when I put the distributer back together...but never before I had 
run my battery down.

Your experience is why I am always happy paying the repair guys to do 
something. I don't know how much that cpu chip would have cost if that 
hard drive had landed directly on it rather than an inch to the side.

OK, serious, stop where you are and don't go any further. Find a good 
repair guy and see if you can convince them to help you find the screw.

You might even just set it aside for three hours, preferably four, and 
then get a small flash light and look where you think it is. Also look 
on the floor below where you were shaking the book. The main idea is to 
stop looking and trying until your mind has settled down and you can 
act more calmly and thoroughly.

I noticed while listening to the Capital Gang on CNN rant on pro and 
con about UM's 20 points for Blacks that not one of the CG on CNN is 
Black.
