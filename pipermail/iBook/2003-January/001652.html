<PRE>Now now... settle down... have a nice glass of wine and relax... it is 
not as bad as all that. Remember the following which inflates the 
apparent level of problems that may come git you.

1) You are on a discussion forum for people who are seeking help for 
their iBook problems... They won't post every time they have something 
go right with their computer. So, the overwhelming majority of threads 
are about problems.

2) There are dozens, maybe hundreds of people subscribed to this list, 
a fair number owning multiple computers. The chances that *one* of them 
will have some problem on a given day is HUGE. So, you'll see several 
messages per day, even though the rate of problems is low.

3) Psychologically, our brains are more attuned to noticing and 
retaining negative information (because, evolutionarily, that's the 
stuff that will kill you). That is, negative information gets our 
attention more readily. Reading  a list of predominantly negative 
information like this will be more psychologically arousing than other 
lists you may read*.

So, keep those things in mind while you read a list like this. It ain't 
so bad as it seems and you may pick up a tip which allows you to head 
off a problem before it occurs.

*except, of course, for *those* lists! LOL!
