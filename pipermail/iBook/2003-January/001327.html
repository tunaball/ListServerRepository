Which model do you have? My 500/combo has a simple latch on the bottom.
Insert coin (or fingernail), rotate a quarter of a turn, lift out battery,
insert new one. There are also little picture icons showing the lock/unlock
position. It's pretty straight forward.

How old is your iBook?

When I bought my iBook 500/combo (Feb, 02), it was a 6 month old demo and
had never been run on battery, hence the battery had never been properly
broken in. As such I found that it only gave me an hour of time. I called
Apple, they sent me a new one a couple days later.

I had also purchased AppleCare (a must for iBook/PowerBooks) included in
this great extended warranty is the battery. If it drops below 40% of it's
expected capacity (I think it's 40), Apple will replace it.

I recently sent it back to Apple because the screen was flickering and/or
staying dim. Shipped on a Monday afternoon (I had called them the week
before and they sent a box to me via overnight), back on Wednesday morning.
