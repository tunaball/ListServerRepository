OK so your statements here show that your credentials are mainly your 
own desires.

&gt;<i> While software is always changing, right now it appears that merely 
</I>&gt;<i> logging on a WiFi Open connection doesn't harvest ID off your laptop.  
</I>&gt;<i> That's according to the author of MacStumbler.
</I>
I remember asking when Java first appeared what was to protect my drive 
against someone coming in over the Internet. The responses I got where 
right out of Sun's advertisements--never happen! Well, what does 
history tell us? Criminey, read the code in any web page these days...

By the way, to find out what does happen, you would have to capture all 
data transferred in both directions over the wifi and then interpret 
it. You would also need to know what encryption would be performed by 
the chips, etc.

By the way, were you diligent enough to inquire as to whether or not 
the info you received from the author was based on rigorous testing 
that had been repeated by several individuals or was it just an 
assumption. What did you require in the answer before you accepted it 
as valid.

&gt;<i> If the first precedent says that an open network is like CB radio, 
</I>&gt;<i> then everything is cool.   If some paranoid IT guy claims borrowing 
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth is tantamount to Wire Fraud, then there goes another civil

</I>&gt;<i> you'll miss when they start taking them away.   The Ninth Amendment 
</I>&gt;<i> notwithstanding.
</I>
In all of the years I have listened to people talking about rights, 
etc, the most obvious discovery I made was that very few of them had 
any constitutional or legal training and they were confusing what they 
wanted with legal rights. That's not saying that what they wanted was 
necessarily wrong but that their statements were self-satisfying.

I'll bet you lock your doors and if people decided to begin camping in 
your yard or lying across the hood of your car or if a stranger picked 
up your cell phone and began to make a call...  :)
