hi all,


    I know these posts were off-topic to ibook but were very on 

topic as to the current climate. I thank these cats for giving voice 

to stuff you just won't hear on the ram-rod sideshow stuff most of us 

are exposed to. I know it's out of place here maybe but I'm still 

glad I got to read it - it gives me hope, a little.

These off-topic threads pop up occasionally, and are often entertaining in a

non-iBook kind of way. People on this list definitely do think differently,

particularly from each other. At any rate, the rants go on for a few days,

then subside and we're back on subject.

I've had tons of Macs over the years, desktop and notebook, even going back

to the desktop sized original Mac Portable. I now use the 600 MHz iBook

model you're considering (though mine has the DVD &amp; CD burner drive) and I

honestly think it's the best Mac I've ever owned. And I paid $700 more for

it (new) just 7 months ago than the price you're looking at. My opinion? Go

for it (along with some extra ram, which you can install yourself.)

Hmm, I don't recall ever seeing chickenhawk applied to pedophiles but 

dictionary.com agrres with you. However, following some links I find 

that books have been published using that term for helicopter pilots in 

Vietnam. Like other words, such as redneck (!), various interpretations 

exist. It does have an an amusing way of clearly stating an idea.

I propose that all elections for public office be advanced two years so 

that anyone elected to office can serve a two year jail term for the 

crimes they are about to commit and that we will probably find hard to 

prove.

These are public figures we are referring to here--among the chickenhawks

are George Bush, Dick Cheney, Jeb Bush, John Ashcroft, Paul Wolfowitz,

Richard Perle, Spencer Abraham, Don Evans, Karl Rove, Andrew Card, Tom

DeLay, Trent Lott, Bob Barr, Mitch McConnell, Dick Armey, Phil Gramm,

Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Newt Gingrich, Mark Racicot, Rudy Guliani,

Charlton Heston, Wayne LaPierre, Bill Bennett, Jerry Falwell, George Will,

Bill O'Reilly, Tony Snow, Britt Hume and Sean Hannity--and as such are

subject to being called any name the public cares to put on them.


I am not saying they are pedophiles, that is your construction. I am saying

that insasmuch as they are promoting war, it serves us all to consider the

roots of such advocacy. There are two kinds of people--those who served and

those who did not. Among those who served, there are those who were put in

a position to kill or be killed. And among these, there are the ones who

survived and the ones who did not. Before we create any more of this last

group, we should carefully consider ALL the options. Many of us believe the

current impasse, as well as other problems afflicting our current body

politic, are largely due to the Bush Administration's utter malfeasance in

foreign affairs.


People close to the current unelected administration who have survived

combat have, to a man so far as I know, opposed the hair trigger, cowboy

approach Bush advocates, going to war with or without provocation or

international support. As has been autoritatitvely documented in the past

several weeks, this administration has no policy apparatus as did every

administration previous, instead making all policy decisions based on short

term political considerations. Neither my children nor yours should die to

advance a domestic political agenda. Just last week it was suggested by a

London Guardian columnist that the better course to pursue would be to

parachute English soldiers into swing states to hand out Bush Cheney

brochuers, thus avoiding the &quot;war&quot; charade.


They are not pedophiles, they are worse. They are craven cowards willing to

sacrifice the blood and lives of your children and mine for the sake of

political opportunism. George W. himself got into the National Guard

because of who his daddy was and then, adding insult to injury, was awol

his last year of obligation. You can yammer on as much as you like about

this not being an unusual situation, but I urge you to check again. This is

different and it is way wrong.
