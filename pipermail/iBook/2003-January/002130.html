</I>I think you missed my point.  How about watching a neighbors pay 
television through an uncovered window  from  the street.  Surely if 
the neighbor didn't want you to watch their television they could close 
their drapes.  Similarly anyone with a wireless network transmitting 
into a public space using public airwaves who doesn't take steps to 
insure their privacy really shouldn't be bothered by someone launching 
an e-mail app and retrieving their mail wirelessly.  That is hardly 
analogous to tapping phone lines or breaking into a password protected 
network; both of which are wrong (unless of course one is operating 
under the protections of the Patriot Act, then I suppose it would be 
for the good of America, and by consequence world citizens alike).
