It appears that for what most people do for writing, they can do it 
without Word and be compatible with the &quot;Forced Standard&quot; of Microsoft, 
and with OS X's ability to be compatible, this becomes less an issue.  
With products like Mariner Write Migration away from the Heinous, 
Soulless Giant becomes that much easier, with less fear of &quot;missing 
out&quot; on anything significant.  I'm assuming this is what you mean. If 
so, cool.

True, MS may employ wonderful Mac folks, but Hitler had great 
designers, too (some of their graphics are great. You can't take away 
from their design capabilities, but you wouldn't want to hang the stuff 
in your house, either.)  I agree with your opinion about associating 
with companies who trade in swill as their common currency of behavior. 
  Would you shake Mao's hand knowing it was responsible for the murder 
of over 20 million people if you didn't have to?  Freedom of choice is 
a priceless commodity. Well spoken, Chas.
