I guess you are asking a real PC-question here. On a PC, there is some
strange notion about the desktop, that it will try to preload the documents
or whatever into the memory of your computer. (Do correct me if I am wrong,
but this is what I have seen on my work-PC's, and I have a few) The way that
PC-users circumvent this is only to make aliases on the desktop, as the
application that acts so silly and eats your RAM for no reason is also very
easily fooled. 

This is not the case on your iBook! The Mac OSes allow you to throw as much
as you like to on your desktop - as long as you have hard disk space for it
of course - without it affecting the performance of the iBook.

If you want to, you can easily throw things into folders or whatever, except
for your drives and the trash(if in OS9), as somebody already pointed out.

Cheers,

Kim
