<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Ally Maddox &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">almenter at madisontelco.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OUCH!!!!!  That hurts!!  :-)  but Dan Farley said we could get one by
</I>&gt;<i> going in with someone else - Dan? This sounds a lot better to me!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, Dan, can we go in with you? Later, I'll go check out the site, as
</I>&gt;<i> sent by Stephen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It should be pointed out that adding people to your Mac.com plan that 
are not living in the same household with you is a violation of the 
terms and you could forfeit your membership if you do this. I should 
add that since IP tracking is obvious and easy, it would be child's 
play for Apple to determine if you were in fact doing this -- assuming 
they bother to check.

Personally, I find .Mac to be VERY worth what I paid for it -- $49 
(plus a $10 add-on for my wife). The free software, the free Kodak 
prints (that alone paid for it), the upcoming new features (one of 
which has already been unveiled -- .Mac address book will soon sync to 
my personal address book, a tremendous benefit), iSync and iCal and 
Backup and Virex ... oh, and the vastly larger inbox and free web 
space. For me, all that was easily worth the $49.

I admit I would have had to think about it a LOT harder at $99, and I 
have to believe Apple plans to unveil more features between now and 
September if they want me to renew at that price.
