I put this question to the author of MacStumbler:   Do most WiFi 
networks log all access attempts?   He said essentially, no.   There 
might be a note in the logs but current networking software doesn't 
suck your ID off your laptop.   If the site uses Access Lists, then 
only registered users can get on anyway.  If not, then any passer-by 
can login.   And unless someone writes spyware for the purpose you can 
theoretically borrow bandwidth without getting caught.   Remember, 
you're not really breaking any laws by doing this.   If I went to my 
ISP and logged in, then I'd have access to their Internet, not their 
files.

You could think of this as being no more illegal than parking in a 
Reserved for Customers parking lot downtown.   And less likely to be 
caught.

I once thought about starting a club to discuss the philosophy of 
Fatalism.
But then I realized that even if anyone came, they'd only come to steal 
the folding chairs.
