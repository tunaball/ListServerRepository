<PRE>Alric,

I bought an external FW housing and HD a while ago (sept. 01) that allowed a
quite fast transfer rate for the time, and it worked brilliantly until this
week...something must of happened with the electronics because it has now
fried 2 HD's (original and trouble shooting drive!) on me!

The major thing I can recommend is that you *read* around if they have
managed to deal with the cooling problems in the housings yet (there is
usually very little heat dissipation possibilities because of the wish to
have a small attractive housing (no ventilation, heat sinks or fans) and
this more than anything may limit your speed thoughts or cause premature
death of the drive...I would recommend the largest capacity you want to
afford but with a 5400 rpm drive (fast enough for most stuff and cheaper
anyway) because of the heat issue...unless you are doing video or such that
requires really fast transfers. Besides if you need/want to upgrade later
for size reasons you then have a drive that works in your older machines
standards (bus speeds or other limiting factors) maximizing your cash
outlay.

just my .02

Cheers,

Richard
