These are public figures we are referring to here--among the chickenhawks
are George Bush, Dick Cheney, Jeb Bush, John Ashcroft, Paul Wolfowitz,
Richard Perle, Spencer Abraham, Don Evans, Karl Rove, Andrew Card, Tom
DeLay, Trent Lott, Bob Barr, Mitch McConnell, Dick Armey, Phil Gramm,
Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Newt Gingrich, Mark Racicot, Rudy Guliani,
Charlton Heston, Wayne LaPierre, Bill Bennett, Jerry Falwell, George Will,
Bill O'Reilly, Tony Snow, Britt Hume and Sean Hannity--and as such are
subject to being called any name the public cares to put on them.

I am not saying they are pedophiles, that is your construction. I am saying
that insasmuch as they are promoting war, it serves us all to consider the
roots of such advocacy. There are two kinds of people--those who served and
those who did not. Among those who served, there are those who were put in
a position to kill or be killed. And among these, there are the ones who
survived and the ones who did not. Before we create any more of this last
group, we should carefully consider ALL the options. Many of us believe the
current impasse, as well as other problems afflicting our current body
politic, are largely due to the Bush Administration's utter malfeasance in
foreign affairs.

People close to the current unelected administration who have survived
combat have, to a man so far as I know, opposed the hair trigger, cowboy
approach Bush advocates, going to war with or without provocation or
international support. As has been autoritatitvely documented in the past
several weeks, this administration has no policy apparatus as did every
administration previous, instead making all policy decisions based on short
term political considerations. Neither my children nor yours should die to
advance a domestic political agenda. Just last week it was suggested by a
London Guardian columnist that the better course to pursue would be to
parachute English soldiers into swing states to hand out Bush Cheney
brochuers, thus avoiding the &quot;war&quot; charade.

They are not pedophiles, they are worse. They are craven cowards willing to
sacrifice the blood and lives of your children and mine for the sake of
political opportunism. George W. himself got into the National Guard
because of who his daddy was and then, adding insult to injury, was awol
his last year of obligation. You can yammer on as much as you like about
this not being an unusual situation, but I urge you to check again. This is
different and it is way wrong.
