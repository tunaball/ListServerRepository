Make up your mind, Eric; you can't have it both ways.

Are you not aware that someone can get a clear majority of the popular 
vote but still not win under the Electoral College rules? It is my 
understanding that Gore won the popular vote (i.e., a clear majority) but 
Bush won the Electoral College. The former is a simple numeric count; the 
latter has to do with how many electoral votes each state has. That's why 
campaigning is strongest and earliest in the &quot;swing&quot; states -- the ones 
with the most electoral votes.

As for making sweeping statements about &quot;percentage of the popular vote,&quot; 
let's not forget how many potential voters didn't vote because they were 
fed up with the ridiculous system, or saw no real difference between the 
Republicans and the Democrats. Don't forget the old statement &quot;There are 
liars, damn liars, and statisticians.&quot; Almost anyone can take the same 
statistics and make it appear to validate their point of view.
