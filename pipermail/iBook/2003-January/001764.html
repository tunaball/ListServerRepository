I have the same problem here in Indy when the temperature drops and the air
gets dry. But rather than spend a lot of money on anti-static sprays, I just
mix my own. I use a 50/50 solution of fabric softener and water in a spray
bottle. I very lightly spray my carpeted floor and even my fabric chair with
the mix. I'm still using the big bottle I made (20oz) about a year and a
half ago. One application seems to last me about 3-5 days. Just get a
softener that has no perfumes added, unless you like the fresh mountain air
fragrance (although the smell doesn't linger for more than an hour or two).

And as an additional precaution, I touch the metal floor lamp sitting right
next to my desk just in case.

I do recall one very bizarre incident a few years ago when I was working at
a small design studio (a converted home).

I seem to generate a lot more static electricity than the average person
(can you say Spontaneous Human Combustion?!?). So to demonstrate my talent
to one of the art directors, I shuffled across the carpet (about 8-10 feet)
and walked up to a wall sconce (light) hanging behind the guy.

When I reached to touch it, ZZZZZAAAPPPP! I produced one of the biggest
sparks I had ever seen (OUCH!). Both of us were stunned when his beige
PowerMac G3 went just went dead! It was as if someone had pulled the plug.
Obviously the computer was on the same circuit as the lamp, but I'm still
amazed that the spark I generated could have that affect. Besides, it was
plugged into an outlet on the wall to the art director's right, about 10
feet from the wall lamp.

Thankfully the machine booted back up but needless to say I was more careful
in the future. As a matter of fact, this is when I learned about my formula
above.
