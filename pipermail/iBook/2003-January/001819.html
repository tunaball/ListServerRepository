<PRE>My stinky keyboard is getting worse.  There are also a few more 
postings on the Apple iBook Discussions thread (under Usage/&quot;iBook 
smell&quot;).

I just called AppleCare Canada, and then Apple Canada Customer 
Relations.  Because my iBook is out of warranty, it's of course my 
problem, not theirs.

But I WAS able to have the problem formally recorded and assigned a 
case number.  If enough people do this, Apple MIGHT decide to do 
something about it.  Those of us who had reported the problem would 
probably not be personally notified of this, but Apple's response 
would be posted in a Knowledge Base article, and conceivably on the 
'hot news' section of the web site.

I'm not naive enough to expect that Apple will actually admit fault 
and replace our keyboards (perhaps if many many many people 
complain?).  I can't wait that long - the smell is too unpleasant, so 
I'm probably just going to replace the keyboard.  If the replacement 
starts to smell I'll really raise a stink.

If you're reading this thread and your iBook is still under warranty, 
if the keyboard has even the faintest BO-type smell I'd report it to 
Apple right away so you can get a replacement before it's too late.

Rosie
