Thanks for the support Jack---not sure what I am going to do from here
really.  Just trying not to do anymore damage.  I'm tempted to open the
machine up myself as I've been pointed in the direction of some pretty good
take apart guides.....but, we'll see.  As you said, I have just left the
ibook for a bit while I've been scouring the net for any help.  I'll figure
it out tomorrow......sigh
