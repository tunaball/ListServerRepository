<PRE>&gt;<i>Help needed......
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I was installing some extra memory in my iBook this morning and I dropped
</I>&gt;<i>one of the teeny tiny RAM shield screws INTO the computer.  The shield and
</I>&gt;<i>the screw hole weren't lining up well, and the screw just rolled into the
</I>&gt;<i>hard drive area.  I tried to shake it out the way it went in(could here it
</I>&gt;<i>rattling around in the machine) but no luck.  Now I can't hear it at all,
</I>&gt;<i>but I know it's still in there.  Have spoken to Apple, as the iBook is only
</I>&gt;<i>about 2 months old and still eligible for free phone support, and they said
</I>&gt;<i>to send it in and that it'd cost $283.  I'd really like to try to get it out
</I>&gt;<i>myself.  Do you think the shaking is a bad idea or damaging?  Anyone have
</I>&gt;<i>any experience in taking the case off an iBook?  Any tips, suggestions,
</I>&gt;<i>detailed instructions on how to take the iBook apart &lt;G&gt; greatly
</I>&gt;<i>appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>Maizy

I had to get a loose screw out of my Powerbook 2400 one time...

DO NOT... I repeat DO NOT turn it back on (sorry for the shouting, wanted
to emphasize the &quot;do not&quot;)--the screw could short out something when power
is restored.

As long as it is off, you can shake, rattle and roll it all you want, it
really doesn't matter, as long as the hard drive is not working.

If you leave it in there, it may stayed jammed for a while, but may work
it's way out again--there was a discussion on another list a while back
about a similar thing, and the guy operated his powerbook this way for over
a month before the screw touched something and shorted out the motherboard.

Afraid this is all the help I can offer right now.
