<PRE>At 10:07 PM -0600 1/4/03, John Paul Moore wrote:

And by doing so demonstrated his selective memory:

&gt;<i>  Peace in the world,
</I>
Somalia, WTC bombing, Haiti, carpet bombing Yugoslavia with the long 
term commitment of US troops, bombing Libyan aspirin factories to 
take people's eyes off Monica, to mention a few things

Chechnya, Rwanda, Colombia, Sri Lanka, the Phillipines, to name a few 
hot spots where he did nothing. We won't talk about his kowtowing to 
the North Koreans, nor his failure to take Osama very seriously.

&gt;<i>prosperity at home,
</I>
Really? What economic problems are solved, what exactly is different 
about the Democratic platform and the problems it ran on being able 
to solve between 1992 and 2000? What? I really can't think of a 
thing. They had eight years and the platform is still saying that 
there are the same economic problems. Meanwhile, productivity is 
increasing, sales and profits increase, when has there been three 
quarters of decrease in the economy of America? Decreases in the rate 
of growth, yes, but real decreases?

The stock market, increased? Really, gee, it is currently at the 
level where it was when Greenspan told you it was overvalued, 7 years 
ago, and began shrinking back to that level in the Clinton 
administration.

Growth in the economy was because the electorate repudiated Clinton 
policies in 1994. Remember that? For the first time in about 70 
years, Clinton's policies cost the Democrats control of the House. 
You can blame Gingrich all you want, but if people had liked what 
Clinton was doing Newt wouldn't have had four legs and a tail to 
stand on.

&gt;<i>fiscal solvency and
</I>&gt;<i>the longest expansion of the American economy in history,
</I>

While the Republicans were in total control of writing and passing the budget.

But honestly, neither party has been really interested in fiscal 
solvency. Since the time of Alexander Hamilton, who proposed writing 
a national debt, because to have the people invested in the long term 
solvency of the USA was a good thing, or so he wrote.

&gt;<i>. You may or may not
</I>&gt;<i>recall, but that decision stopped the valid recount of ballots in Florida.
</I>
There was never a valid recount of votes suggested or proposed, there 
was continual machinations for selective vote recounts that were 
hoped that somehow could give Gore the edge. It dragged on for nearly 
8 weeks, during which time the 'let every vote count' propaganda was 
clearly discredited by the very real  decision to judicially 
disenfranchise American servicemen that had voted by absentee ballot 
from overseas. Despite getting most of the selective recounts that he 
requested, he still never got that edge, despite his disenfranchising 
our own military to stop the extra votes for Bush.

&gt;<i>Between the votes cast for Gore and Nader, the American people actually
</I>&gt;<i>voted a strong repudiation of the unmandated coup de etat government now in
</I>&gt;<i>power. Anyone who can count can verify this for themself.
</I>

So IOW, as I suggested you never really cared about the constitution 
and the electoral collge requirement. Let's revive your selective 
memory. If the combined votes of the people for Gore and Nader prove 
a strong repudiation for Bush, then the combined votes for Bush and 
Perot in '92, and the combined votes for Dole and Perot in '96 would 
be a landslide defeat for Clinton. By your logic.

That would be supported by the people's further rejection of Clinton 
with landslide victories for Republicans in Congress in '94, with 
continued control of both houses, until their illegitimate regaining 
of power by one vote switching in 2000, which was again reversed  by 
the people in the 2002 elections so that we now have bicameral 
Republican control again. So by that measure, it would seem a fairly 
significant proportion of the population support Bush, 2 years into 
his administration, unlike the first two years of Clinton.


So this is the last I say on this topic as well. I apologize to the 
list, again. I didn't start it, and I probably won't end it, except 
that I won't make any further replies to it.
