People, can I remind you that we are members of a list populated not just by
US citizens? This discussion is largely irrelevant to those of us who don't
live in your country. I don't feel that it would be appropriate to engage
other Australians on this list in a public discussion of our political
system's strengths or weaknesses. It has no place in this forum.

And I'm getting tired of the Jack vs. Charles competition thing too - I've
read useful posts from both men but this is getting out of hand.
&quot;Kill-filing&quot; a list member's posts is not the answer. Why should any of us
have to do that? A more tolerant approach is needed by all.

I'd really ask that we take a step back and have a look at where this
community is moving. Could I make a plea that the irrelevancies be taken
into a private forum - how about you use iChat? There's a (tenuous) link
back to the topic of the list...

Anyway, I just had to say something. Has anyone else taken the time to look
over the last few days and calculate the on-topic to off-topic post ratio?
It doesn&#185;t look good.

And I know my AUD$0.02 are worth about 1c US so I apologise for the less
valuable contribution.

Cheers,
Jon Wever


PS Macworld kicks off in a less than 48 hours - can't we be interested in
that???? Lets have some juicy, on-topic rumours... Or something...
