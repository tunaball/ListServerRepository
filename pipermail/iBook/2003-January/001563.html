<PRE>The following is copied from today's Macintouch and seems important 
enough to bring to your attention. You can go to Macintouch.com for 
more info and to click on the recall link for more info.


The Consumer Product Safety Commission and APC announced an APC UPS 
recall this week, after determing that back-up power supplies might 
overheat and potentially cause a fire:
In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), 
American Power Conversion Corporation (APC), of West Kingston, R.I., is 
voluntarily recalling about 900,000 back-up power supply devices. These 
devices are primarily used to protect computers in case of a power 
failure. The power supply device can fail, causing the unit to 
overheat, which may pose a fire hazard to consumers.
&#160;  APC has received six reports of units overheating resulting in the 
melting of the unit's outer casing and three reports of minor property 
damage. No injuries have been reported.
&#160;  The recalled Back-UPS CS Uninterruptible Power Supply devices 
include the Back-UPS CS350 and the Back-UPS CS 500 models. The model 
number can be found on the front of the unit, along with the words, 
&quot;Back-UPS CS&quot; and &quot;APC.&quot; In addition, one of the following numbers 
shows up on the bar code label located on the bottom of the unit: 
BK350, BK500, BK500BLK. The recalled power supply devices also have one 
of the following serial numbers - AB0048 through AB0251, BB0104 through 
BB0251, and JB0125 through JB0251 - which can be found on the bottom of 
the unit. Units with an &quot;R&quot; at the end of the serial number within the 
above ranges are not part of this recall.
&#160;  Retailers, computer and electrical distributors, and catalogs 
nationwide sold the power supply devices from November 2000 through 
December 2002 for between $70 and $130.
