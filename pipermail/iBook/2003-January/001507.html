This wasn't his question. His question was: Is it OK for my computer to 
be in sleep mode when boarding an airplane (where they ask that all 
devices be turned off). I have no actual answer for that question, except 
to say, I've traveled with my iBook in sleep mode for the entire trip, 
boarding, security check, etc. and had no problems.
