  I have taken mine apart about 4 or 5 times, for one reason or  
another, usually hard drive related. If you are  relatively  
technically inclined and enjoy doing this sort of thing, you should  
not have a problem.

  Leave yourself plenty of undisturbed time. I would say 3 hours for  
your first opening. I can probably do it in under an hour now.

  Plenty of space to spread out. You will have lots of parts to lay  
out. A dining room table with a solid colour table cloth. The cloth  
will prevent things from sliding/rolling off, and the solid colour  
will help you find screws and things on it.

  Having an assistant is good. Someone to tape the screws while you  
remove them. Someone to keep the cat off the table. Someone to take  
over if you get frustrated with any one part.

  The part I had the most trouble with is the top case (the part with  
the track pad). After the screws come out, there are snaps that pop  
off. They take a firm pressure, but you will be afraid to break it.  
Just apply a gentle pressure , increasing it till they pop off. In my  
case I was very frustrated with that part, until I discovered an  
extra screw and a clip that were not on the plans. Turns out that  
there are some minor differences between the plans I had, and the  
466Mhz Firewire computer I have. I see that iFixit has a selection  
for all the different speeds, so you should be OK if you get the  
correct one.
  Also, once you get the top separated, don't forget it is still  
attached by the ribbon cable holding the track pad. So after using  
force to separate the top, lift it off gently.

  Good Luck

Steve
