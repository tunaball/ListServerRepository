<PRE>Hi Carol-Lynn. I was thinking about you yesterday. Someone was after  
RAM for a slot load iMac so I relayed your experiences with RAM  
Direct. You wouldn't have any contact details would you?
I have had a look at the caslis pages but I think the Fixit guide is  
more detailed and shows the steps better. Probably printing both out  
would be quite handy. If bits are not clear in one, you could look at  
the other.
If you are using an external drive, I presume it is a Firewire SE  
model - sorry but I can't remember the details. If it is not, it will  
be terribly slow under USB as they are only 12 mhz on USB compared to  
400mhz under Firewire.
As you say, it depends on the convenience you want. If you are using  
the 80gb drive from your iMac, it will be a 3.5&quot; and I am not sure if  
there are any enclosures around for larger drives that don't need an  
external power supply. If the laptop doesn't have a FIreWire  
connection, you would always need to plug it in to power from an  
external source as USB needs two USB connections - one for power  and  
one for data, and the original iBooks only had one - and a very slow  
one at that!

RAM is quite easy - you won't have any trouble with that = just  
remember usual precautions with RAM - handle the least amount  
possible and not by gold edge, and touch the metal inside of the  
laptop  when you start.

It is such a shame you are so far away that I can't give you a hand  
with it.

I have a big Expo next week where all the 10 schools in the cluster  
are coming to the local High School and showcasing what they have  
been doing in the Cluster over the last few years. It has built up to  
something really big and most of the other schools in the district  
are coming along to see what we have been up to. We were hoping to  
target the High School staff but their response has been limited. It  
is seen as something for only the ICT and Technology Depts. We have  
got all sorts of nasty tricks up our sleeve to try and get others  
interested. There is a huge organizing committee of one - guess who?  
Most things are sorted but I have one or two headaches that are  
causing a few sleepless moments. Hopefully it will all be sorted by  
next week. Keep in touch re your fun and games with your new toy
Cheers

&gt;<i> My baby has Arrived today and it is in such good nick.  I have  
</I>&gt;<i> erased the
</I>&gt;<i> current 3 GB Hard Drive and reinstalled OS8.6 and now I am putting   
</I>&gt;<i> OS 9 on
</I>&gt;<i> it.  Might not be needed but I am just muckong around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I have had a suggestion from one iBook lister saying NOT to try to
</I>&gt;<i> replace the Haard drive and to use an external one.  It seems like  
</I>&gt;<i> a valid
</I>&gt;<i> option except it sort of defeats the purpose of having a portable  
</I>&gt;<i> laptop in
</I>&gt;<i> many ways.  If I was to go with the external option I could take  
</I>&gt;<i> the 80GB
</I>&gt;<i> Hard Drive from my current iMac and use that as an external Hard  
</I>&gt;<i> Drive and
</I>&gt;<i> pop in a 10Gb into my iMac.  I guess that way I could have my music  
</I>&gt;<i> on the
</I>&gt;<i> 80Gb external and then swap between the two.  I would then not need  
</I>&gt;<i> to buy a
</I>&gt;<i> 2.5&quot; internal  hard Drive for the iBook - But I like the idea of being
</I>&gt;<i> portable!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First thing I need to do regardless is up the RAM in this baby.  Is  
</I>&gt;<i> that an
</I>&gt;<i> easy thing to do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also can you tell me what you think about these instruction for  
</I>&gt;<i> replacing
</I>&gt;<i> the HD in a clamshell iBook.  I have the ifixit instructions but found
</I>&gt;<i> these...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://caslis.com/mac/ibook/ibdrive.html">http://caslis.com/mac/ibook/ibdrive.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Shall I do it?  I need to buy RAM first anyway, but what about the HD
</I>&gt;<i> replacement???
</I>&gt;<i>
