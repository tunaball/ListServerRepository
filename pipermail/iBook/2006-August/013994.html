<PRE>A certified Apple shop should not be afraid to take it apart. 
 
The yo-yo adapters did have a huge problem with the connector. However, the
daughter cards inside the iBooks are known to be notorious also. I would
think that another adapter at the Apple shop could be used temporarily to
see which is the problem.

Subject: [iBook] What is more common to go wonky on a Clamshell: the
poweradapter or the power plug? 
 
I have a Clamshell 300MHz. It is my pride and joy. Just recently I started 
having problems with the &quot;yo-yo&quot; power supply. Or maybe it's the jack that 
the power supply plugs into? Therein lies my dilemma. What is more common to

go wonky: the power supply or the jack daughter card? 
 
The trouble about getting this diagnosed locally is that my local Mac tech 
people are scared of working on Clamshells. They charge atrocious,
exorbitant 
labor charges just for looking at a Clamshell, much less fixing them. The 
only place I know of without this fear is in South Carolina, (Wegener Media)

and I would have to send my computer over for them to look at it. If I can 
get this all figured out and squared away WITHOUT having to send my beloved 
little Navi for a Southeastern US &quot;Spa vacation&quot; it would be truly kewl. 
 
Is there someone in the Los Angeles (preferably San Fernando Valley) area
who 
maybe I haven't dealt with yet who might not have this paralyzing, lurking 
fear of Clamshells? Is this likely to be a power supply issue and the
problem 
will go away if I replace the power supply? Please let me know, thanks!
