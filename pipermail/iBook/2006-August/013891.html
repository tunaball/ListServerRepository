<PRE>Brian, I don't see why it should make a difference, but do you have filtering turned off in your Google Preferences? Google has three filter levels: none, moderate, and strict filtering and that needs to be set. Again, your site doesn't seem like a candidate for filtering, but maybe Google's filters are set on certain keywords, perhaps one of which your site happens to contain.

One other thing occurs to me. Your browser might be filtering results in a Google search - Internet Explorer has a filtering (&quot;rating&quot;) system; I don't think Safari nor iCab does and I'm not sure about Netscape. I use Firefox which doesn't have filtering. But, the filters work on the websites themselves and I don't see how this could affect a Google search.

<A HREF="http://www.thecorgroup.net/">http://www.thecorgroup.net/</A> comes up fourth on my Google search (my Google filters are turned off); the three sites above all relate to thecorgroup.com. I don't think it's anything to do with your search - you're using the same keywords that I'm using.
Forget meta tags for Google (I don't know how much meta tags/keywords are used in the lesser search engines like MSN or Yahoo these days, but they're old technology); Google indexes almost all words in its indexed pages. (I get more than a few hits on &quot;buzz haircut&quot; because I mentioned in one of my web pages that I gave myself a buzz haircut prior to a major ham radio trip to Labrador.)

We'll get this figured out sooner or later.
