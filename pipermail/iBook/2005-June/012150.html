Laser + color = $$$$$$$$$$$
If she has any large-ish Adobe programs (PageMaker, FrameMaker, 
probably Photoshop), they come with Acrobat Distiller for making PDFs. 
She could distill to PDF then print to any printer (that you can 
install a driver for) from Acrobat Reader.

&gt;<i> We looked at an HP 4 Color personal laser printer that had HP

</I>&gt;<i> not good for Quark output from an Mac because it's not Adobe PS. He

</I>&gt;<i> Question 1) Is HP Postscript that much different from Adobe Postscript 
</I>&gt;<i> that it would cause us problems?
</I>
It can cause problems in certain circumstances, according to some 
FrameMaker users. (I use Frame at work and subscribe to a couple of 
mailing lists; there have been occasional problems with HP's PostScript 
emulation.) Note that I print almost exclusively to HP printers at work 
&amp; don't have PostScript issues, but they're not color printers.

&gt;<i> Question 2) What do people here recommend for a Postscript printer to 
</I>&gt;<i> output Quark type documents?
</I>
I don't use Quark, so I can't really speak to what works best with it. 
Personally, I'd just make PDFs and print to whatever I have available, 
but that's just me. :-P

&gt;<i> Question 3) Should we combine the above printer with color output or 
</I>&gt;<i> get a separate color printer for photos &amp; such?
</I>
You could buy a B&amp;W laser printer, an inkjet photo printer, and Acrobat 
Pro (for PDF manipulation), and still save big bucks over what you'd 
spend on a color laser printer. So yeah, I'd get a separate color 
printer unless I really needed it and could write it off on my taxes.
