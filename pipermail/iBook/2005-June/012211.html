<PRE>Dear listers,

I just replaced the Toshiba DVD/CDRW in my 600 MHz dual USB iBook.

The original drive stopped working two weeks ago, in my iBook which I  
have had since October 2001. I called Apple and it was going to cost ~ 
$300 to fix. I found that I could buy a replacement drive for $112.  
It would be an exact replacement, so that I could use the same door  
bezel.

I had read some accounts of doing this on the web, but most said that  
this was hard and recommended against it. I decided to try anyway,  
using the accounts that I found on the web.

I had a handicap. I had my two kids (4 and 8) watching, and sometimes  
bumping the table and containers I had the screws in. In spite of  
that, I finished in 3 hours, and only had four screws left over, and  
it works!

If I were to do it again, I would use a related description for the  
hard drive of a 500 MHz iBook, which had templates to mark the  
location of the screws for later placement. There are lots of screws,  
with different sizes even for the same &quot;function&quot;.

It was nerve-wracking at times, but I am happy with the results.

David Linker
