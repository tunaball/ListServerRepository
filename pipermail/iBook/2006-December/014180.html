Didn't have to go to the point of creating a new location. Once I got the AppleTalk, TCP/IP, and Internet Control Panels and the Open Transport extensions (was off) all set to the right configurations and Airport turned on, it was simple after that except when the wireless provider turned off his equipment for the day. The location set itself by default (this was the first she ever had her clamshell online). End of test.

I'll tell you, hobbling down memory lane on her antique clamshell is a mighty different trip than the ease of OS X for getting online with anything (dialup, cable, satellite, wi-fi, and cellphone - I've used them all), even my HughesNet satellite connection for which I just wrote an Installer's Guide for getting Macs online with the HN7000S modem. Cardinal rules: let the OS X machine do all the work with its automatic settings and don't mess with the settings once it's working. At least now I can get her upgraded to 9.2.2, but if it hadn't been for her low RAM, I'd have switched her to OS X in a Yankee second.

Thanks to everyone for the online and off-list help and moral support! I appreciate it!

Fred
