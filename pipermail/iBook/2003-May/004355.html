</I>The long and short of it is simply this: There appears to be no compelling
reason to partition your hard drive for OS X. When I got my new G4 I made
the decision not to partition and later when I got a new iBook I again
didn't partition. This was after being an avid proponent of partitions. Now
I've tested OS X with a partition just for data and I've tested it giving OS
9 its own partition. In neither case did I see any speed advantages or
disadvantages.

Now having no partitions and only one drive does have one disadvantage - if
your computer won't start up you don't have another partition to select as
your boot drive. On the other hand, I've not yet needed this functionality.
My iBook goes everywhere I do and I've yet to have any problems with it.
Also, if you download lots of files and throw most away, or perform similar
tasks, you might want to consider using a disk image to reduce drive
fragmentation.

I can't speak to the issue of a partition reducing speed other than to say I
never saw such a thing. If you are doing DJ work you might want to consider
an iPod. I've seen several local DJs using them for that purpose.
