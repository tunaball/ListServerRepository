There's been a thread of thinking around the fact that, Yes, you can 
get these services cheaper elsewhere, maybe, but the whole package from 
Apple, with the ease of use and what not, is the selling point.

I'm sure I haven't used the membership to any of it's potential, but 
that's typical for me and my ocmputer experience: I take a while to rev 
up.  I had my Newton MP 2000 for over a year before I became a 
slathering, drooling, crazed Newton user.  So it seems, to me, there's 
much lurking beneath the surface of the .Mac service.  The Home Page 
part seems pretty interesting to me for things other than home photos.  
It could be a good place for resume/portfolio display, for instance.  
Maybe I'm too green to get that this isn't a big deal.

Can anyone comment a little more on these matters?  Of course, you can 
write me privately.

Thanks.

Mark
