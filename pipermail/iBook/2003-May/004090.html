Hi Jay,

I haven't seen 3.0 yet, but from my reading of the site, Plus Optimizer 
is not included. You can still run it from the 2.1 disk if you boot into 
OS 9.x. As for defragmenting and optimizing:

Defragmenting means putting all the pieces of individual files in 
contiguous physical locations on the disk. That can be done and you can 
still have lots of large and small unused blocks (e.g., leaving no large 
contiguous blocks available -- which some programs need).

Optimizing means doing the above and then moving things around so that 
all of the free space is contiguous. There are specific schemes for doing 
this, some keeping directories at the beginning of the drive, and some 
even keeping different kinds of files in different areas of the disk. I 
even remember one that let you choose the kind of things you do with your 
computer, and optimized differently according to that choice. With 
today's large and fast drives, I think this has become less important.

Hope this helps,

Harry
P.S. I can't boot my new eMac from the DiskWarrier 2.1 disk, since it has 
OS 9.1 as the boot system and the eMac requires OS 9.2. Can anyone tell 
me exactly what files I need to have on a CD if I burn a Utility disk so 
I can boot into OS 9.2.2? (Apple tech support told me that they couldn't 
tell me that &quot;for legal reasons.&quot;) Thanks!
