<PRE>'Evening, everyone...

I was just searching around the internet for someone that sells 
protective covers for the keyboard and 'wrist rest' area of the iBook 
and then I thought, 'hey... ask the iBook list.'  I recall seeing 
someplace mentioned on a website a couple months ago, but of course, at 
that time I didn't think I wanted anything like that.

I can find sites w/keyboard protective covers, but can't seem to find 
the site for the other. I recall it was something similar to a cling 
type flexible clear vinyl/plastic that covered the area below the 
keyboard, on either side of the track pad. As I've been spending more 
time on my iBook writing lately (which is a good thing), I'm beginning 
to think that those areas are going to be showing some wear at some 
point and I'd like to keep my iBook in as pristine condition as 
possible. I plan on keeping and using this sweet little guy for several 
years. I also have a G4 desktop computer that I use for most other 
computer tasks, but reserve my iBook for my writing and some email. Oh 
yeah... iTunes. Gotta have iTunes going on my iBook, too.

I'll be continuing my search and will post back to the list if I 
discover anything. But in the meantime... anyone have a clue on 
protective covers?

Thanks. I'm enjoying the list and all the problems/solutions being 
discussed and the playfulness here, too.

Namaste,

Kathe
Royal Oak, MI
