This is similar to what I was posting the other day.

Battery life seemed to be shortening... then it would suddenly drop to 
zero with no battery warning going to sleep. Wierd.

By the way, helpers here were very helpful!

It was a bad battery (some have suggested lots of batteries from the 
summer of 02 were bad, mine was an August 02 iBook).

Anyway, I called Apple. In 10 minutes I was talking with someone. He was 
very patient as I tried to reproduce the problem while on the phone. I 
would read off batter life numbers (and percentages) while playing music 
in iTunes (with Visualizer running) and it all happened as before. The 
tech put a battery in the mail for me immediately, arrived before 24 
hours passed. The mailing label was designed so that I simply tore off 
the top and gave my old battery back to Airborne Express for it to return 
to Apple. Couldn't be simpler. 

Since my machine was less than a year old, it was in warranty.

When you are talking on the phone make sure they know you suspect 
hardware so that it is within warranty even if you have not bought Apple 
Care.
