Bill, I googled them w no result on the web; so then i ran their name thru
google's newsgroup archives and came up w this fairly recent conversation
which is perhaps the same one andy had read.  Maybe contact  Davis or Zisman
(see below) to see if either learned anything further?
I was thinking that the powermac4u website Looked quietly professional, but
i wondered why they only had paypal?... Then i looked closer at their url
<A HREF="http://shop.vendio.com/nwpowermac/home.html">http://shop.vendio.com/nwpowermac/home.html</A>   Backtrack it to vendio.com,,
and you'll see that vendio has created their webpage....  vendio.com is a
storefront, so to speak, for anyone who wants to set up a business.

Do you think Aoole would help in any way? Could they exert pressure on
Vendio? or on Paypal? There just can't be anyway someone who is selling like
this is an authorized dealer, can it.

Now, here is the conversation from the google newsgroups.

</I>They claim to be local to me... so I drove to the address reported on
their website-- it turns out to be a post office box.
They didn't answer an email I sent them.

Wish you luck. Let us all know the outcome.
