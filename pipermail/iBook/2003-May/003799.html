Consider recent presidents and vice presidents:

Bill Clinton never swallowed but Lowenski didn't either.
Bush doesn't know the definition of coward and mangles words and ideas 
when not in front of a teleprompter.
Dan Quail never met a name or city he couldn't forget, mispronounce or 
say something really stupid.
Nixon's VP was kicked out of office for accepting a bribe while in 
office.
Nixon...
Nixon, Regan, Bush, Bush caused economic chaos as soon as they got into 
office with their tax cuts, program cuts, etc. Massive government 
layoffs and unemployment.

Just because I enjoyed the ban the bra movement and women's liberation, 
doesn't make me a bad candidate.

I'll bring Macintosh into the oval office and my first act will be free 
iBooks for everyone.

I will also sell off all of the $500 gold plated dinner plates and feed 
our guests on paper plates and food from a fast food joint rather than 
spend $800 per guest on food, licquor and service. Foreign dignitaries 
get so used to that they think nothing of asking for Another Billion to 
take home with them. Now, when they see how poorly they feed them, they 
will realize the US government is once again busted and they will start 
giving us money.

No more arms sales to any country and we will seek out and destroy all 
arms dealers.

All Republicans will be required to take my economics class which 
explains how $1 in tax money circulating in the US (not given away to a 
foreign country) eventualy is handed off enough to become $10,000 in 
new sales and $2,000 in new tax money. Thus, every $1 tax cut costs the 
economy $10,000 and the US government $2,000 in taxes. No wonder 
Republicans create such huge deficits.

Democrats will be required to take my economics class which teaches 
that every dollar they spend will be paid by future generations and so 
they cannot create any new spending programs which aren't immediately 
paid for by current taxes or funded by the users, such as turnpike fees 
or gas taxes.

Both parties will be brainwashed to keep their dirty hands off of 
Social Security taxes and Lotto income.

See how clear using a Macintosh makes one's thinking...
