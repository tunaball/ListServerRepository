&gt;<i> &gt; From: Stephen Hywyn Jones &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">Steve at hywyn.plus.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been advised that &quot;partitioning&quot; is the only way to go, but 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; given that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ibooks now install both operating systems in the same sector as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; default, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hoping that their advice is based on old knowledge, and that the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new ibooks and operating systems are less prone to crashes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Partitioning has nothing to do with any crashes. Just leave it the 
</I>&gt;<i> way 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple sent it to you unless you have some VERY SPECIFIC reason for 
</I>&gt;<i> doing otherwise.
</I>
I'd like to kindly disagree with this advice (or perhaps just offer one
very specific reason!).  The first thing I do with any OS 9 and X
bootable machine is partition the hard drive and install the OS on
seperate partitions.  I'd even recommend having a third partition for
important data [that you have a copy of on another partition].  I like
to use extra hard drives on towers (safer!), which is kinda (har har)
hard to do on the iBook, but partitions buy you a similar effect.

Why?  Well, if your hard drive is over 20 gigs, you've got space.  And
when something *really* fooks on your iBook, say an OS conflict issue,
sometimes installing the OS from scratch is the fastest and easiest way
to get back up and running.  And when I say &quot;from scratch&quot;, I mean
wiping the partition and getting a fresh install from CD (and then
firing up software update for a while).  

So when OS X corrupts somehow or becomes unbootable, you'd boot into OS
9 on the separate partition, grab the files you need from your X
partition (moving them to 9 or storage) and wipe the X part clean. 
Quick, easy, safe, and effective.  If your drive up and dies, well,
you're still toast.  Hope you bought a CD burner and used it! :^)

Fwiw, I'd recommend using half your hard drive for X (many apps like to
live on the same partition, like fink &amp; friends) and a quarter for 9 &amp;
another quarter for storage space.  Your prefs might indicate different
partition sizes, but that's a pretty safe start.

But I would stress that if you don't feel comfortable partitioning,
don't.  I'd recommend becoming comfortable, however!  :^D  YMMV.
