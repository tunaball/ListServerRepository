<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Brian Olesky &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">brian4 at sbcglobal.net</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For everyone like me who needs to send or receive a few faxes a month 
</I>&gt;<i> via
</I>&gt;<i> their computer, and who had no trouble in the olden days of OS 9, but 
</I>&gt;<i> who's
</I>&gt;<i> been left high and dry in OSX, the answer is finally here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I'm referring to is a new program called Page Sender, which I 
</I>&gt;<i> learned
</I>&gt;<i> about in the latest issue of MacWorld.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>A great option, to be sure (and only $30!), but I feel compelled to 
point out that the $10 shareware product Cocoa eFax does much the same 
thing for less. I bought it early on for my modest sending and 
receiving fax needs (maybe 5 faxes in and out per month) and it's 
performed flawlessly.

So while there's no really great *professional-strength* faxing 
solution out there for OS X yet, I'm happy to tell you that the myth of 
&quot;no good personal fax software for OS X&quot; is dead and buried. Between 
these two products (both of which offer free trials), you're bound to 
find something that meets most personal-faxing needs.

TIME: The people at Listen.com say downloading isn't the most popular 
feature on their music service, Rhapsody. What's your  response?

JOBS: Well, that's correct. Downloading sucks on their service! You 
download a  track and you can't burn it to a CD without paying them 
more money &#8212; you can't  put it on your MP3 player, you can't put it on 
multiple computers &#8212; it sucks! So of course nobody downloads! You pay 
extra to download even on top of subscription fees. No wonder they have 
hardly any download traffic &#8212; they hardly even have any subscribers!
