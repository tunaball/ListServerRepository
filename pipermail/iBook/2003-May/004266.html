<PRE>&gt;<i> What I really don't understand is why people are so obsessed with 
</I>&gt;<i> worrying about the incomes of multi-millionaire musicians. It seems 
</I>&gt;<i> like misguided attitudes to me. But then I've never understood the 
</I>&gt;<i> crowd mentality that cheers for multi-millionaire ball players and 
</I>&gt;<i> then goes home to cold franks and beans. Maybe that is it, hiding from 
</I>&gt;<i> reality...
</I>
    I will personally guarantee that 95+% of the bands I listen to are 
nowhere near the millionaire mark. With the exception of Elvis 
Costello, natch, the Sea and Cake (who were just recently featured in a 
Saturn ad,) and perhaps Kings of Convenience (who were just played in a 
Greyhound ad.)

    I just ran a quick search of 25 artists selected at random from my 
(rather extensive) CD collection. Of these 25, only one showed any 
results: Wilco. I was not surprised by this, as they were on Reprise 
until they were dropped when their latest album, yankee hotel foxtrot, 
finished production. (Incidentally, I'd recommend a listen to that 
one-- voted one of the top albums of 2002 by Rolling Stone ( 
<A HREF="http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=2043926&cf=57">http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=2043926&amp;cf=57</A> ), 
not that I read.)

    Of the 4000 CDs I own, all but perhaps 100 of them were purchased 
direct from the bands, at shows across Western Canada, or via mail. I 
care about how much these artists make. But I'm likely the odd one out.

    In any case, I won't be buying from the Apple store. Even when it 
does come to Canada. Whenever that may be.

    ( &lt;/rant&gt;, sorry! )
