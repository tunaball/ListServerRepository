Actually that's a complete lie, sorry :)

I remember now one instance of a disc that would lock up the iBook
approximately 42 minutes into playing. I tried the disc on an iMac also
running OS9 and the same thing happened at the same point on the disc.

Examining the underside revealed nothing untoward. I then tried it in a
standalone DVD player and it worked fine.

If I fast forwarded past the 42 minute mark (by a few seconds), then the
disc would continue to play fine on both Macs.

There's weird stuff that goes on with DVD's. Before I got a standalone
player, one of my friends told me about his problems. He's been through
about five standalone DVD players and all but one of them will refuse to
play some disc or another. For no discernable reason! Its just something
that happens. I've checked it out in specialist magazines too, they are well
aware of this happening.

However, the fact that only one out of three of your discs seems to be
working still leads me to think about either dirty or smudged discs, or a
dirty lens. Have you got any kids that handle the discs? Honestly, I see so
many who plaster their grubby hands over these things, scratch it to hell
with a buzzsaw, use it to file down barbed wire, throw up on it, play
frisbee with it and still expect it to play fine.
