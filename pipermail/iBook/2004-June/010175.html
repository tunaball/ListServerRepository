I don't think the policy in Los Angeles is different from what you have 
described. We can use routers and run as many computers as we wish 
(because the router hides the computers). There is no attempt by 
Comcast to sell us additional IP addresses.

Comcast would like to sell us it's own networking hardware and software.

Historical note: comcast.com purchased what used to be attbi.com which 
in turn was mediaone.com. Attaching two computers to mediaone brought 
swift reprisal: both computers would be immediately denied service, and 
the cable modem had to be unplugged for a few minutes. It was like 
getting a parental time-out! With attbi the same policy held for a 
while, more than a year ago the policy, without announcement, changed, 
so that mulitple computers could be used with one cable modem without 
fear sanction. Now comcast.com has returned to the &quot;one computer - one 
modem&quot; policy, but violation of the rule isn't as harsh as it used to 
be. Any etra computer connected to the modem simply fails to connect 
with the comcast.com network, but the &quot;legal&quot; computer will keep 
working.
