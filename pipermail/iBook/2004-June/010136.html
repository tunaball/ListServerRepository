<PRE>I think the easiest solution is to hook up an external antenna to your 
neighbors base station if possible.
I seem to remember reading about using one airport to extend the range 
of another I.E. linking together. ( you would need to research this to 
see if it is possible )

I would also recommend that your neighbor turn on the WEP protocols and 
give you access.

Good luck. keep us posted as to results

&gt;<i> Short question: does anyone know how I could  boost my neighbor's

</I>&gt;<i> is something my neighbor suggested to me, I'm not trying to illegally 
</I>&gt;<i> tap into her wireless network).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Long background: Our ISP (Comcast) just cut off the use of more than 
</I>&gt;<i> one computer on a single modem. So about a week ago I purchased a 
</I>&gt;<i> AirPort base station (too bad I couldn't wait for the new AirPort 
</I>&gt;<i> Express). I have an AirPort card and the other computers run off the 
</I>&gt;<i> base station from an ethernet connection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few days ago I walked outside with my iBook to see how far from our 
</I>&gt;<i> home I could wander before the base station signal faded. Not very 
</I>&gt;<i> far, as it turned out. However, a message popped on my monitor, 
</I>&gt;<i> telling me my neighbor's network across the street was available. A 
</I>&gt;<i> couple days later I saw our neighbor and told her about tapping into 
</I>&gt;<i> her network. She told me that she works for a cable company (not 
</I>&gt;<i> Comcast). She also said she wondered herself how cable companies would 
</I>&gt;<i> make any money once people realized the power they had to network 
</I>&gt;<i> their communities on their own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My neighbor told me to tap into her network anytime I wanted to, and 
</I>&gt;<i> to cancel my own Comcast account. However, I can't pick up her 
</I>&gt;<i> wireless signal inside my own home, and I spent too much money on and 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still having too much fun with my own base station to give it up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, I'm tempted to at least think about how I could join my 
</I>&gt;<i> neighbor's network. I fantasize about our block linking all of our 
</I>&gt;<i> computers together, with a few base station-equipped homes and/or 
</I>&gt;<i> ethernet cable strung between houses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So again my question: how do I boost my neighbor's wireless signal so 
</I>&gt;<i> that I can receive it in my own home? Is there something I can do in 
</I>&gt;<i> my own home to make my iBook's AirPort card more receptive to the 
</I>&gt;<i> wireless signal coming from my neighbor's home? Could my base station 
</I>&gt;<i> somehow pick up my neighbor's signal, maybe by adding an antenna 
</I>&gt;<i> (right now of course my cable modem is plugged into my base station)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or do I need to make it happen from my neighbor's home, boosting the 
</I>&gt;<i> output from her wireless network so that it can at least reach my 
</I>&gt;<i> home-office, which is in the front of my house? Could I, for example, 
</I>&gt;<i> add an external antenna to my neighbor's (PC) base station, or could I 
</I>&gt;<i> take my own antenna-equipped base station across the street and 
</I>&gt;<i> somehow add it onto my neighbor's network, to serve as a 
</I>&gt;<i> relay/booseter/networking bridge? If that worked,  but if my 
</I>&gt;<i> neighbor's signal only reached to the front of our house, could I add 
</I>&gt;<i> an AirPort Express to our home, to boost/relay/bridge the signal to 
</I>&gt;<i> the rest of our house?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
