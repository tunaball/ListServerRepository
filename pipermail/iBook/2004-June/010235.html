    If you are having problems with Keychain...you are _not_ alone and
nobody, including Apple, seems to have a solution to this problem.

    I sincerely suggest you go to Apple.com, click on the Support tab, then
click on Discussion after the Support page loads.

    Find Safari on that page, click on it, then do a search for Keychain and
sit down with a cup of Java and be prepared to read for about an hour.

    As an example, below is the most comprehensive response I have seen so
far.

    This URL, will take you to directly to this thread on the discussion

============RE: safari won't open secure pages

I've spent several days trying to figure out exactly what is going on with
this problem over the course of the last 2 weeks, including spending 2.5
hours on the phone with Apple on a Sunday. It seems to be related to airport
use in conjunction with Safari. I'm on OS X 10.3.4, Safari v 1.2.2 build
125.7. We spent  a lot of time making sure my OS libraries are not
corrupted, and that the version of Safari I'm using is current and non
corrupt. In the end, they neither denied or admitted to a problem, but
ultimately I spent time talking to a Safari product specialist. They
wouldn't say whether they'd fix it or not. They did say they'd contact me
with questions if they had any.

Since then, I've spent time and money changing to an airport extreme (white)
base station from an airport (graphite) base station, with no difference.
Its definitely related to the airport IN CONJUNCTION WITH the Airport in
that computers on my Ethernet connected to DSL have no problems, but the o!
nes 'airported' do. It happens on both iMac G4s and graphite g4s, but I
haven't gotten a laptop over here to check it yet.

Very disappointing. Some have mentioned that it doesn't seem to happen with
Internet Explorer. IE has problems too! IEs are intermittent. They have been
referred to in this string .. sometimes Yahoo mail won't send a new mail,
and sometimes it will. Safari won't even open the page to send mail. It also
won't even read inbox or bulk inbox.

One thing the Apple tech support told me on the phone was that the problem
doesn't make sense .. in that IE works and Safari doesn't. I don't know
enough about the base software to make that judgment, but I CAN say that I
absolutely abhor IE and

I WANT MY SAFARI and I WANT IT NOW!
