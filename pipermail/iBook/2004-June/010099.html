<PRE>Thank you everyone for all your help!

I was able to recover 30 out of 75 photos using Robert's suggestion - 
PhotoRescue... I bought the software.... I recovered the photos 
straight from my Nikon SQ digital camera disk... since I already 
formatted the disk after uploading the first batch of photos, I was 
only able to recover the photos taken in the last batch... but it's 
better than nothing. I tried this software to recover files from the 
Mac HD but I was unsuccessful. Somehow it recognizes 3 partitions which 
I did not create, there were images that came up but were not the ones 
I was looking for. I suspect these partitions were created by Norton 
Utilities 8 which I also purchased to recover my files from the Mac HD 
but I was unsuccessful.

With Norton Utilities, I started up the Mac from the CD, used unErase, 
didn't work... I then used Volume recover, my iBook dies while 
optimizing the volume so I had to reboot everytime. I did it several 
ways until I gave up. Perhaps it created the 3 partitions?

Oh well.. I gave up. having Norton Utilities in my iBook is good for 
the future since I'm very careless. Photorescue will be great too if I 
accidentally delete images from my digicam disk.

Thanks for all your help again...

Gary

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HD, and save them to a special file that you can retrieve when you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> register the program.  So if your files are not there, you are out 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing.  It works great.  The sooner you use it, the better the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chance it will recover them, as as you write to your HD you could 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overwrite them.  There is a version for Macs and PC, or a combo 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version.  The price is very reasonable, especially in light of what 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grief it will spare you now and in the future.
