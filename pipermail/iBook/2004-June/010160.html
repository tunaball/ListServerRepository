That sounds reasonable to me. But now that Comcast has stopped me from 
using more than one computer on their modem, it wants to charge me to 
network my computers. Comcast wants $5 per month plus a $199 
installation charge. That's for one additional computer, it's $300 for 
4-5 computers. That doesn't seem as reasonable to me. To rub salt in my 
wounds, Comcast says Macintosh computers aren't supported - whatever 
that means.

Doing it myself (with a basic router) would cost considerably less 
money than Comcast wants. (I went the full Airport base station/Airport 
card route, which cost me more money, but I'm wireless and of course it 
works with the Macs in our home.)

The Comcast monopoly, the continued raising of prices for monthly 
service, and the cost of networking my computers through Comcast, make 
me want to take up my neighbor's offer to join her own wireless network 
and cancel my Comcast account.  And I would be doing my part to provide 
Comcast with an extra IPv4 address!
