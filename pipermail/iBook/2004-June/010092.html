Ok, have you done any maintenance stuff? Like running Disk First Aid,
Techtool Lite (free download from MacUpdate.com), Norton or anything else
you might have? 

I've had my Graphite 466SE clamshell almost three years now and not had a
problem with the DVD player, and I've got tonnes of extensions, particularly
Office 2001 with comes with approximately 50 trillion extensions for the
Office Assistant alone.

I was reading an article (possibly on LowEndMac) by a guy who cleared out
his OS9 iBook of all things Microsoft. From that point on he was happy to
claim that OS9 was the most stable OS he'd used, and he was also using
various flavours of OSX at the time, too.

Something else I've heard about DVD discs themselves is that they are
extremely susceptible to error if there's so much as a thumbprint on them, a
helluva lot more so than ordinary CD's. I've got CD's from eBay where
they've been scratched to buggery hell, but they still work fine on the
iBook or in a normal stereo. The same cannot be said of DVD's. I'd check the
underside of your discs also and give them a good clean. The fact that you
are getting a mixture of errors suggests to me that the discs may be dirty,
or the lens inside the iBook is dirty. Cleaning either might help
significantly. 

If you're going to go the Clean Install route, I'd get the basic OS9 up and
running, and then download Apple DVD player v2.7 from their downloads
section. Its a more recent version of the player you have on your system
discs.   Then see what happens. After that I'd begin installing whatever
software is necessary for your use and see if any problems crop up.

The DVD player for me, has been the most trouble free of my standard OS9
applications. 

Finally, when the film is running on the iBook, do you experience any
'sparklies' on screen? Almost like interference? This kind of issue suggests
something wrong with the video card, but I've only heard of it in
Powerbooks.
