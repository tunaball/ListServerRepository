Hi All
need help here I need to know how to get hold of the Chicago state
Police. from The Uk
Reason for asking is I sent someone on the swap list an Ibook 900 G3
with combo 384 ram and good battery and 20gb hdd Under the illusion.
That they were honest and know that they have signed for the book i
have not even got a reply to my emails for the last 3 days. I know
that i have lost the book and also that i will not get the money or
the desk top for it as i have been conned and would like to involve
the police as i am out of pocket buy &#163;400. FOR THE BOOK AND ALSO &#163;90.
TO SEND IT. I would like to have this person prosecuted if i can. and
also slandered  and named as a thief.
I am really disappointed that these people can get on these lists and
are so dishonest. can anyone in Chicago help me out here. i can mail
you all the details of the person and also give you a description of
the signs i left on the book to tell it was mine (i will not give
these out to the list.).
Second dealing with the states this last year that have gone bad and
i think that i will be calling it a day for sending bits over there
now. apart from the friends that i have onlist that i trust. and Know
i can trust.
Sorry to tar people with the same brush but it has cost me to much to
be understanding any more.
 &gt;
I truly feel for your losses Vicki, and hope that someone will put
you in touch with both Chicago's finest fraud/bunko squad, and also
those of the Postal Service if you sent the Book that way. But do
know that it will be difficult, as I'm guessing that no Tracking
or Insurance were placed on the parcel or Delivery Confirmation,
any of which will require a signature at delivery time.
I do hope, that now you'll raise the help of those good souls @:
