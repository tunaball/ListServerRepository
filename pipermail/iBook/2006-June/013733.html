In iTunes, select the tracks you want to isolate and either shift/ 
command/n or File &gt; New Playlist from Selection. That will put all  
the tracks into a playlist by themselves. If you copy the playlist  
to, say, an iPod, all the tracks will follow.

As for isolating them in a folder: If you look in your music folder  
and open your iTunes music folder, you'll see that it probably is  
already in a separate folder. It may be named &quot;Untitled&quot; or something  
like that if this is a homebrewed CD and isn't in the online music  
database to catch the album name and track names and put them in the  
metadata. The tracks may also be named something like &quot;Track 01&quot; and  
so on. You can rename these tracks in iTunes and add other  
information, such as album name, author, date, and so on. Just select  
all the tracks and do Command-I or &quot;File &gt; Get Info.&quot; This will bring  
up a dialogue box in which you can change/add all kinds of  
information. If you want to name the tracks, you can do it by  
clicking on the track name and retyping it, or use the Get Info  
command to do each track one at a time.

The amount I've written makes it appear far more daunting than it  
actually is. Once you've seen the commands at work and note what  
they're doing and where they're doing it, it will be a breeze.
