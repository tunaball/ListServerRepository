I think that the time to complain and ask for a replacement would have been
earlier on, say when you called them for the third or even second time. I'm
assuming that your iBook's extended warranty is approaching expiration, if
it has not, in fact, expired, already. If so, Apple will not likely offer to
replace an iBook that is, as Apple has supposedly put it, &quot;at the end of its
useful life.&quot; I have seen where Apple has replaced iBooks which were still
under warranty, so if yours is still covered, you might have a chance, but
it will probably be a slim chance. Call Apple and ask to speak to someone in
Customer Relations. Plead your case with them nicely and reasonably (i.e.,
don't make demands or call them ugly names), and you might get somewhere.

I recently had a similar situation with my G3 700 iBook ('03 vintage). It
started exhibiting the old, familiar logic board symptoms back around the
first of April, so I called Apple about it only to find out that the
extended warranty had expired back in March! The tech support person I was
talking to at the time didn't offer me any suggestions or solutions, so I
asked to speak to Customer Relations and pleaded my case with them. To make
a rather long story short, Apple did offer to meet me halfway and fix my
logic board for the fourth time for $150 (half the cost of the repair) which
I accepted gladly. (They really were under no obligation to do even that.)

Yesterday, I ordered a new MacBook. Expected delivery is in two weeks.
Shortly after it arrives, this iBook will go up for grabs on eBay. Should be
worth something for parts, at least... :)

A waist is a terrible thing to mind.
