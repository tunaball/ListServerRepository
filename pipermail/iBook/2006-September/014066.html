<PRE>Thanks for the answers, let me clarify

I should have said that I don't see the iBook &quot;disk burn&quot; software 
prompt...like I am used to in Toast. I was thinking that maybe you 
have to install a disk burn program to use the CDRW. And I only had 
the old Toast program to use. I was expecting the window prompt to be 
labeled &quot;disk burn utility&quot;, &quot;iBurn&quot; or something. The generic window 
seemed like a OS prompt that is confused about what the CD is for and 
do I know what I want to do with it. Which is about what it says but 
it doesn't give me any indication that burning photos is an option.

&gt;<i>You are saying you have an external CD burner that works on Toast 
</I>&gt;<i>under OS9 on your desktop and you want to use the burner on your 
</I>&gt;<i>iBook, which presumably hasn't got a CD writer.
</I>
my &quot;about this mac&quot; says I have a Sony CDRWDVD fully supported and I 
believe it. I just have never used it. This iBook is new to me and I 
am just now getting around to doing iPhoto things.

&gt;<i>You should be able to download and install Patchburn
</I>
Thanks for the link...

&gt;<i>You said to someone else that you did not have a burn symbol across 
</I>&gt;<i>the bottom but could that be because the window is not open up 
</I>&gt;<i>enough? the iPhoto window is not fully open, there is usually an 
</I>&gt;<i>arrow in the bottom right corner
</I>

the only arrow i see is the one that indicates rotating the photo


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>and when you click on that, it shows the additional icons that it 
</I>&gt;<i>can't display because the window is not open enough.
</I>
additonal icons??? like what???  my iPhoto version is 1.1.1
I was looking for a picture screen to show what my windows look like 
and saw iLife (...cool does that run on 10.3?)

&gt;<i>This will only burn an iPhoto album(s) which is fine if you want to 
</I>&gt;<i>install in iPhoto but no good to send to someone else with a PC.
</I>

I really need PC communication

the explanations below are still assuming I don't have CD burner on 
the iBook? Or if I am using my iBook's CDRW?

My problem is that I didn't recognize the window prompt as from a 
burner...it wasn't labeled. So i am going to

&gt;<i>Anyway, that aside, once  I had run Patchburn and restarted, I would 
</I>&gt;<i>insert the blank CD.
</I>
snip

&gt;<i>It sounds a lot of steps but I'm sure you'll follow it when you do it.
</I>
thank you for taking the time to explain all that. I will keep those 
instruction in mind or at least in a file folder...which is more 
reliable for recall.


&gt;<i>300 photos does not sound a lot for iPhoto to handle. I regularly 
</I>&gt;<i>have over 2000 at times in my iPhoto. How much memory do you have on 
</I>&gt;<i>your iBook?
</I>
256MB

&gt;<i>Have you run a Disk Permissions lately.
</I>
wazat?


&gt;<i>Could you go up to the iPhoto menu when you have it open and Select 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;About iPhoto&quot; and let us know which version you have?
</I>
1.1.1

I am sure the answer is upgrade...and more memory...$$$$$.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hope this is a help. Get back to me if I have forgotten anything or 
</I>&gt;<i>I can help further
</I>&gt;<i>Cheers
</I>&gt;<i>H  in NZ
</I>
thank you so much
