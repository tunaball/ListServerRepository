<PRE>Kristina, there seems to be a number of issues here and apologies in  
advance if I am confused and I'll add, it is awhile since I have  
worked in 10.2 so I am working from memory here.
You are saying you have an external CD burner that works on Toast  
under OS9 on your desktop and you want to use the burner on your  
iBook, which presumably hasn't got a CD writer.
You should be able to download and install Patchburn which will add a  
couple of files to your machine which will enable it to recognize and  
write to your CD burner under OSX without using Toast.
You can download a version for 10.2 here

<A HREF="http://www.patchburn.de/download.html">http://www.patchburn.de/download.html</A>

 From memory, you need the drive turned on and connected for it to  
detect it and add the necessary files.

Once you restart, it should recognize the drive.

You said to someone else that you did not have a burn symbol across  
the bottom but could that be because the window is not open up  
enough? If the iPhoto window is not fully open, there is usually an  
arrow in the bottom right corner and when you click on that, it shows  
the additional icons that it can't display because the window is not  
open enough. This will only burn an iPhoto album(s) which is fine if  
you want to install in iPhoto but no good to send to someone else  
with a PC.

Anyway, that aside, once  I had run Patchburn and restarted, I would  
insert the blank CD. When the window comes up, just click Ignore (I  
think)

Select the photos you want to burn and then go to File and select  
Export (or Hold/Shift and press E).
You can then set the size you want in the left hand size and just  
leave it as default size if you don't want to change them. The right  
hand side you can probably ignore or change the options as desired.
Click on OK
Now you can navigate to where your blank CD is
It should appear in the panel on the left, right down at the bottom,  
showing as Untitled, but I can't remember whether this occurs in 10.2
____________________________________________________
If the blank CD is not listed, I would Hold Apple - press D to go to  
the Desktop, then make a new folder by clicking the New Folder button  
and copy the photos into there.

When this has finished, you can close iPhoto. Click once on the  
folder and Hold Apple - press C (for copy)
Then click once on the CD icon and Hold Apple press V (paste folder  
into the CD
___________________________________________________

Then hold down Ctrl and click on the CD icon. Burn Disk should be an  
option about one third of the way down the menu.

It sounds a lot of steps but I'm sure you'll follow it when you do it.

300 photos does not sound a lot for iPhoto to handle. I regularly  
have over 2000 at times in my iPhoto. How much memory do you have on  
your iBook? Have you run a Disk Permissions lately. Could you go up  
to the iPhoto menu when you have it open and Select &quot;About iPhoto&quot;  
and let us know which version you have?

Hope this is a help. Get back to me if I have forgotten anything or I  
can help further
Cheers
