</I>
First of all, under the Eudora license agreement, I don't think you 
have to pay for the Eudora upgrade to OS X.  It's been a while since 
I've used Eudora, but I think you get upgrades free for one year after 
you paid for the software.  I would talk to Qualcomm to be sure, but 
that's my gut instinct.

If a Eudora upgrade isn't in the cards, there are two things in this 
equation that can change:  Your browser and your mail client.  I would 
start with the browser - have you tried using other OS X browsers 
(Netscape 7, Safari, Camino, OmniWeb) instead of iCab?  I've never been 
terribly impressed with the stability or bugginess of iCab - perhaps a 
browser switch would solve the problem.

Alternately, you can replace Eudora.  The cheapest and fastest solution 
is to use OS X Mail.  Don't just use the default import feature in Mail 
to covert your Eudora mailboxes - use Eudora vCard Export and Eudora 
Mailbox Cleaner instead. &lt;<A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/aamann/">http://homepage.mac.com/aamann/</A>&gt;  I switched 
over to Mail.app from Eudora using these, and recommend them highly.  
Eudora Mailbox cleaner can even convert all of your Eudora filters to 
Mail.app filters - possibly the single most useful feature of the 
program.

Hopefully, one of these suggestions will do the trick for you.  Best of 
luck in solving your problem.

Regards,
Zach Heaton
