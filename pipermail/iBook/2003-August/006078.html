<PRE>The Jag battery issued resulted in less than half an hour's time...

This from MacFixit's special report on X.2.4

Portable Battery failure

Users affected by the strange bug that causes portable (PowerBook/iBook) 
battery capacity to quickly deplete after upgrading to Mac OS X 10.2.4 
should investigate a replacement battery, according to reader reports 
suggesting that Mac OS X 10.2.4 can be safely installed with the new 
power packs.

Lucy Johnson writes:

&quot;I have had no relapse of the short battery life/failure to charge 
issues since getting my PowerBook back from Apple last Thursday. As soon 
as I received it I updated to 10.2.4 again because I felt that the cause 
of my problem was hardware, not this update. I ran my computer with the 
adapter attached until last night, 10/9/03, and then unplugged and ran 
on battery until it was completely drained. I recharged it successfully 
to 100 percent with no problems, the adapter light is glowing green and 
the charge percent is showing 100 percent.&quot;

The replaced part (for a 12-inch PowerBook) is: 603-1204 Battery, LITH 
ION; 46W/630-3961 PCBA; DC to DC.

If you are experiencing this problem, you may want to download the small 
Mac OS X utility X-Charge, which displays an antialiased graph of the 
battery charge over time (up to 24 hours) and keeps in a log file all 
battery related events.
