</I>
If I recall, Netscape 7 has a mail component.  Barring that, I would 
switch to Mail.app or another dedicated e-mail client.  You will need 
to know whether your mailboxes are POP or IMAP, and you will need to 
covert them to the new program - a process that may require several 
steps between progressively newer applications.

For a browser, I wouldn't use IE - try Safari or Camino instead.  
Microsoft has officially killed development for IE on the Mac, but 
Safari and Camino are alive and well.  (These are not the only active 
browsers out there - iCab and OmniWeb are still under active 
development.)

&gt;<i> I didn't load iMovie and iTunes because I have them in OS 9, but then I
</I>&gt;<i> realize I need to get the apps that run under X. (Will those run also

</I>&gt;<i> ...Can I just drag over via Ethernet, iMovie and iTunes from my iMac
</I>&gt;<i> which has them loaded in X apps? And then delete them from OS 9 to save
</I>&gt;<i> disk space?
</I>
Short answer:  Yes, probably.  These apps should be drag-and-drop to 
install, assuming you don't want to transfer preferences or anything of 
that nature.  After you're done, go ahead and delete iMovie and iTunes 
from OS 9.  You may need to import your music and movies into the OS X 
apps, but that shouldn't be difficult.  Make sure you try this before 
you delete the OS 9 apps, however!

&gt;<i> To run Palm, I had to load it in 9. IS there an X version of Palm? (if
</I>&gt;<i> so, where do I get it?)
</I>
You can either use the iCal/iSync/Address Book combo supplied by Apple, 
or you can download Palm for OS X here: 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.palm.com/us/support/macintosh/mac_desktop.html">http://www.palm.com/us/support/macintosh/mac_desktop.html</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> In order to buy music in iTunes, I need to run QT 6.x. However, I have 
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> paid version of QT 5 Pro.
</I>&gt;<i> If I load 6 in X, will that wipe out my v 5 Pro in 9?
</I>
Not a clue on this one - can anyone else on the list provide a 
definitive answer?

&gt;<i> Realize this is a lotta questions, but they're piling up.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for help.
</I>
Glad to help as best as I can.

Regards,
Zach Heaton
