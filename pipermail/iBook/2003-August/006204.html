<PRE>&gt;<i> So is there any other reason why I should upgrade this old baby? thanks

YES!!!!! If you have to do a lot of typing or mousing with the 
trackpad, it still has the most comfortable palm and typing areas ever 
created on a laptop. If you have a frequent need to change locations or 
rooms while you are processing files or projects, you can semi-close it 
and carry it by the handle, when you get to the new room, the files are 
done, ready and waiting for you.

Last year, I spent a lot of time in hospital and doctor's waiting rooms 
with my husband. When I would get to a critical point in a project it 
would be our turn, I just semi-closed it so it was less likely to get 
knocked into a door jam and didn't have to lose a lot of work or figure 
out where I was or make the doctor wait for us. I also got the ibook a 
lot of attention.

It is still one of the most rugged laptops ever made and is less likely 
to have screen problems like the newer, smaller, thinner books do. If 
you over pack your computer bag, you are less likely to get screen 
damage. That said, NEVER overpack your computer bag with any laptop and 
always put something the same size and flat, ie, a legal pad or notepad 
with NO SPIRAL binding, a magazine, book, etc., next to the screen side 
of your book to keep it from being damaged by a sharp object in the bag 
poking or pressing into the screen from the back side.
