<PRE>&gt;<i> From: don hinkle &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">donhinkle at att.net</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   I'm thinking, going into my 3rd year, that I'd like to have access to
</I>&gt;<i> Jaguar occasionally, tho still will mostly boot into 9 (don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> slow things down by running certain apps in Classic).
</I>
Where DO people get the idea that Classic is slower than OS 9?

I just did a series of timings, things like starting up; opening 
Photoshop 4 and running filters; opening Quark 5 and complex documents; 
opening MS Word 2001.

In every single case without exception, Classic was faster than &quot;real&quot; 
OS 9. Sometimes quite significantly faster. This is 10.2.6, latest 
everything we are talking about -- haven't even explored what Classic 
under Panther would be like.

It's been my finding that people think OS 9 is faster than Classic 
because of a few tangential things (like opening menus and other Finder 
ops) that OS 9 still does a bit faster. But that's not where you do 
your work, and any head-to-head of productivity with people on OS X and 
OS 9 is going to end with OS X the winner, I guarantee it.

There are some situations (still) where working in OS 9 (not Classic) 
is a good idea. Certain older and exotic printers and scanners perform 
better. Certain older programs perform faster. There are a handful of 
apps that I know of (nothing major) that refuse to run in Classic. So 
I'm not saying OS 9 is junk.

I'm just saying that this myth of slowness in Classic was put to bed 
rather firmly when Jaguar came out.

&gt;<i> 	Is it ok for me just to load Jaguar on at this point (after a backup 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> course)? Or do I need to take precautions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You make it sound like you're handling live bacteria.

The only &quot;precaution&quot; I would suggest is that you download and remember 
to use Onyx or Cocktail once OS X is installed, and thereafter use em 
about once a month.

That the PC world would doggedly stick to a dull, unimaginative, 
clinical term like 'IEEE 1394' (notice how it just rolls off the tongue 
-- NOT) for the sole purpose of *saving a few pennies* over using an 
imaginative, exciting, visually-stimulating term like 'FireWire' tells 
you EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW about the PC world and that whole 
industry-wide mindset.
