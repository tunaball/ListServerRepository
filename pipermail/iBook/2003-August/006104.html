<PRE>&gt;<i> I remember some time ago, on this list there was some chat about
</I>&gt;<i> battery time under Jaguar but I paid little attention since I was
</I>&gt;<i> still running OS 9. Well, now I'm almost fulltime in Jag...and I just
</I>&gt;<i> started my iBook in a situation where it's running on battery, and the
</I>&gt;<i> icon shows 2:53 time remaining. Under 3 hours, whereas before, in 9, I
</I>&gt;<i> was getting close to 4.

Don, I can't remember which ibook you are using. The subject seems to 
indicate it may be a clamshell. If this is the case, an you have been 
using it consistently for a couple of years, it may be a battery age 
problem. If you still have a copy of 9.2 on it, there is an Apple 
battery update that may boost it a bit if age is not the problem. If 
you have an airport card in it and leave airport on all the time, that 
will decrease your battery time also.

I have a BB clamshell that I ran 10.0 on for a while and don't recall 
any time loss from using X. At that time, I had an airport in it but 
rarely turned it on.

Most of the time now, I am using my icebook 700 running 10.2.6 with 
airport turned on all the time, with brightness about 65-70 % towards 
the high side. In energy saver, I have it set to the factory default 
for &quot;longest battery life&quot; which puts the monitor to sleep at 1 minutue 
oof inactivity and the system at 5 min of inactivity. I consistently 
get about 4-4.5 hours battery time. With this energy setting, the 
screen also darkens quite a bit just before it sleeps. Since the 
monitor is the greatest battery drain and I require more screen light 
than many others, I am probably losing some battery time from that.

I bought the icebook right before the Jag battery problem sprouted and 
even though I updated as soon as each new update came out, I have not 
experienced the battery drop problem reported by some others.

Here is a website about Li batteries that may provide some useful 
information in general and specific factors that impact battery life 
and longevity. I ran across it but have not finished reading it 
completely
