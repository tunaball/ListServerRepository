<PRE>It really shouldn't be an issue. Make sure you are up to date with your
ibook's firmware first. I seem to remember there was issue's of ibook's
crashing and burning with out the proper firmware, but I can't find it in
the Apple tech files. Other than that, make sure you have at least 256MB of
RAM, actually the more the better. I run 640 MB on my ibook and OS X, it
runs rather nicely. Do your self a favor and trim down OS X's install by
removing some stuff you won't need. Under Customize in the installation,
uncheck Localized Files, Additional Asian Font, Fonts for additional
Languages. Also, under Additional print drivers only install the one for
your printer. If yours isn't list, uncheck that box all together. I choose
to uncheck my printer due to there being a newer version available for
download. You can also uncheck the BSD Subsystem if you are not installing
the developer tools. I hope this helps.

Subject: [P1] load OS X?

I've got an original 500mghz iBook, dual USB. When I got it, it had X on
it, but I had no X apps, so wiped and reloaded just with 9. Now I'm
running 9.2.2. Have a 20G HD with about 9G left.
  I'm thinking, going into my 3rd year, that I'd like to have access to
Jaguar occasionally, tho still will mostly boot into 9 (don't want to
slow things down by running certain apps in Classic).
	Is it ok for me just to load Jaguar on at this point (after a backup
of
course)? Or do I need to take precautions?
	Thanks for any help...

followed by a bust. One of the biggest was in 1984, when dozens of
