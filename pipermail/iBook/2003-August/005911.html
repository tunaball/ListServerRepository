I've never cared very much about how small a phone is (within reason). I use
the belt clip. I really love it. Prior to the 7135, I had a variety of
phones but never had any strong feelings about them. This phone is great!
Sound quality is about the best I've ever heard.

Battery life is okay. However, if you use the phone a lot, you'll want a
second battery. Fortunately, the cradle that comes with the phone will also
charge a second battery.

I sync using iSync and Hot sync manager. I sync mostly for back up as I
don't really use the iCal or Address book very much. As I have a .mac
account, I also sync everything to that. I haven't had any real problems.
Every now and again, it seems to double events. I'm sure there's a good
reason (some small change I've made) but it doesn't happen often enough for
me to worry about.

One day, I kept getting fatal errors, nothing worked, except the phone
parts. I took it home, backed it up, did a hard reset and restore and life
has been great since.

I've always been comfortable with graffiti so the lack of keyboard isn't a
big deal for me.

I thought that I would regret spending $500 on a phone but I haven't.
Verizion Wireless has a fifteen day return policy so you would have a chance
to check it out. 

I always wanted a Psion, but back then, I couldn't afford them.
