<PRE>&gt;<i> Actually, that's reassuring but it doesn't help me aesthetically while
</I>&gt;<i> I'm writing! Is there anyway while I'm working to get a better look? I
</I>&gt;<i> tried Geneva but didn't like it much either.
</I>
Since I have a lot of visual problems and reading is generally an 
uncomfortable task regardless of why, I have always used a &quot;dual&quot; font 
system. I have a pet font that permits easy, comfortable typing 
(currently comic sans 14pt is set as my AW default), I also enlarge it 
enough to be easy to read from whatever distance I am working. Once I 
have my text solidified, I then format the text and finally, I apply 
the print font and check for cosmetic defects due to the font 
switching. I find this method makes life easier, more comfortable and 
is actually time efficient for me.

I also use comic sans as my default font in everything that gives me a 
choice. However, in many apps, ie, mail, web browsers, etc, I set it to 
18 pt. Since many web pages don't let me alter the fonts, I also make 
liberal use of the font larger buttons. For OS system help pages and 
similar miniscule type, I am finding ways to make friends with 
Universal Access's Zoom feature. I try not to use that too much because 
it makes me dizzy.

On my 23&quot; monitor, I also dropped the resolution to the next to highest 
which magnifys the default help stuff enough that I can almost read it 
without too much stress. On the iBook, dropping the resolution costs 
too much real estate so I am using the alternate solutions I mentioned.

You many also want to experiment a bit with the anti aliasing option in 
the sys prefs under&quot;general&quot; at the bottom of the page. This setting 
controls how much &quot;smudging&quot; the system does to remove the jaggies from 
text. Depending on your visual acuity, you may be more or less 
sensitive to the blurriness this can cause. Test it by changing the 
size both up and down and working a few minutes after each change until 
you find your comfort zone.
