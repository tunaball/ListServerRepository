If you think it's time for a new Book then it usually is, 400 to fix  
800 to buy, no debate you buy new. Although, I might look at the  
macpro, more money however the product is matured with this release  
mid run and will last you a good 3 years maybe 5 stretching it. The  
new release of OS X will unleash some of the power that has been held  
back as it is written for the Intel chip in mind. For your book, I  
might try some of the suggested tips to see if this fixes things in  
your ibook, ram being the most finicky. The experts are not always as  
thorough as they should be. Once you get to replacing 2 year old  
logic boards, those are boards out of old machines that have been  
rebuilt, they do not keep making new logic boards for &quot;old&quot; machines,  
although sometimes you can swap a newer one in but then your getting  
into FrankenMac.

Again &quot;I'll be using it a lot, for work (I'm freelance so I can't  
*not* have a computer) but not making massive demands, on the whole &#8211;  
mostly WP, email, and web. I do a bit of photoshopping, video editing &quot;
That's your answer, now that we have these speed demons of power, the  
software and the internet will be making huge demands on video ram  
and processor power, so rather then try to stretch things tighter, go  
for the biggest and best you can afford, you will need it and in the  
long run, it will last you longer. If in the budget I  would keep the  
iBook, get it to where it runs, a good back up, if the budget says  
sell, sometimes parting it out can get you more money then
