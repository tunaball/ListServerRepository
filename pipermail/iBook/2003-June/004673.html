Whether the (allegedly) stolen material is distributed free or not doesn't
matter.

&gt;<i> It wont fly.. their case is basically a nuisance case.. I'm sure that

</I>
Irrelevant. If, since then, copyrighted UNIX code has been added to the code
base, anyone using a Linux kernel that contains this code is violating the
UNIX copyright.

&gt;<i> Another strike against them.. Linux's strength is that it is developed
</I>&gt;<i> by a huge community of people, for free.. so suing that community is
</I>&gt;<i> basically futile.. because nobody 'sells' it.. it is given away.. at

</I>
Again, this is irrelevant.

&gt;<i> SCO is a company that used to make a unix variant for 386 PCs (yes, really
</I>&gt;<i> that long ago..)
</I>
Longer. They used to be part of Microsoft, and made Xenix, MS' UNIX variant
that ran even on 80286's.

&gt;<i> They still exist, but mostly just to pursue

</I>&gt;<i> proportions morally, IMO, especially after they seemingly released the

</I>
Did they really? If so, their case is futile. But simply having the code out
there doesn't imply that it is henceforth in the public domain.
