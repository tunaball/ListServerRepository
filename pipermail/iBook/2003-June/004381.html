No question about it -&gt; when the drive fills up there is a noticeable 
increase in drive activity and resultant slowdown. It isn't a question 
of the partition causing the problem but rather simply a full drive. 
You'd see the same thing whether you had a full 20 gig drive or a 160 
gig drive with a full 20 gig partition.

</I>&gt;<i> anomaly.
</I>
Over the years I've had a few drives go south bad enough that I had to 
reformat them back to square one. I never noticed that partitioned 
drives were more prone to this than unpartitioned and I can only think 
of one instance where a partitioned drive failed so badly that I lost 
all the partitions. However, I will add that my experience in the PC 
world has totally put me off soft partition schemes. (For the 
uninitiated, a 'hard' partition cannot be changed without erasing the 
drive and starting over. A 'soft' partition can be resized without 
reformatting or losing data. For this reason it seems like a good idea. 
Seems...I've seen lots of 'soft' partition failures.)

I agree here. The only reason I'd consider partitioning a drive for OS 
X would be a) the drive is too big to be fully addressed because I had 
an old style drive controller, or b) I did massive download/deletes. 
Even then, I'd probably just use a disk image in most cases.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I backup my internal to an external LaCie Pocket drive. If I need to, 
</I>&gt;<i> I can boot from that and then backup to the internal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ditto. At home and at work I have a disk image ready to restore my 
iBook and a data CD that is never more than a week old. At lunchtime my 
iBook automatically syncs my document folder to the network. When I go 
on the road I copy the disk image and data folder to my iPod. That 
still leaves me about 3 gig for music.
