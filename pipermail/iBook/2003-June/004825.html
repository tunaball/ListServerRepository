    I was reading the fine print on their website, earlier (because 
their prices are pretty good, once
you figure in conversion to Canadian currency) and they do not 
guarantee compatibility with your
system. If it fails, it's covered, but if it doesn't work from the very 
start, they won't take it back.
I'm of the understanding that, while Crucial.com charges a little more, 
if there's anything wrong
with the memory, at any time, for nearly any reason, they'll replace 
it. That's the kind of
insurance I'd like to have.
    Their policy page ( <A HREF="http://www.18004memory.com/support/policy.asp?">http://www.18004memory.com/support/policy.asp?</A> ) 
seems worded
vaguely enough in places to worry me. (I also find it funny that part 
of the shipping policies
section makes it sound like Canada has been annexed:
	&quot;We ship to all 50 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands and to
	any other U.S. possession. No other international orders will be 
accepted without
	prior approval.&quot;
I guess I missed that memo.)
