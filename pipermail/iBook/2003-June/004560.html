Yep - as much as I like my iceBook the one area where it is inferior to 
my tangerine is the palm rest area. After coding or writing for about 
30 minutes my palms begin to hurt. I got a new computer desk at work 
last year and lost my monitor shelf so I started looking for a notebook 
rest. My wife beat me to it, getting me one of those fancy white round 
ones. A ridiculous price but the iBook looks awesome on it. I use the 
white Apple keyboard that came with my server and a (gasp) MS mouse. 
People who come into my office are always impressed by the setup - even 
PC users.

&gt;<i> I forgot the specs on the questioner's new icebook but if it has a

</I>
This is what I do. I used a CDRW nearly every day all this school year 
and it is still going strong. I also have a 64 Mb flash drive I got as 
a freebie at a conference. I use it for small files. Love it. I was an 
early adopter of zip drives and got burnt early too. I had three drives 
die by click of death. I stopped trusting them after the second death 
but kept one for students until it also died. At that point I stopped 
using them. Don't get me started about Jaz - wouldn't take one if given 
to me along with a C note.
