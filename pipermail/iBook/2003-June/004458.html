Thank you! I think you've hit the nail on the head! I sometimes have it 
plugged into a surge protector and sometimes not....My husband 
sometimes has the surge protector full of stuff that he's working on so 
I just plug into the wall where there is room. With all the stuff we 
have plugged in, it is surprising that we haven't burned down the house!
Well, with all the heat that the 'book has produced over the past few 
months I'm sure that it's innards are in 'not new' condition as they 
should be, perhaps I'll try to get Apple to replace it just because 
they never asked me where or how it was plugged in. Had they started at 
that point it would have saved them &amp; me alot of grief and me &amp; some of 
you alot of typing! That is, if this is actually the problem...I'm 
gonna keep it plugged into the surge protector and tell the 'hubby' to 
NOT touch it and see if it does the overheating/fan thing again. If &amp; 
when it does Apple will get THE phone call and the next you'll hear 
from me about this subject is that I have a &quot;new&quot; iBook.
Thanks for all the input, everyone, and for keeping on with the 
suggestions!

Fran
