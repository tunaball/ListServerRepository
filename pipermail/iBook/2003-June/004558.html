<PRE>Joost says:
&gt;<i>I'd advise looking for the third revision 600 MHz model at least (the one

</I>

I own the 600mhz iBook, and my stepdaughter has the 500mhz iBook, so 
it's very easy for me to compare the two.  Both of our machines are 
running 640mb RAM, and our system installations are essentially 
identical.

The 600mhz is noticeably faster in almost everything other than the 
simplest of tasks.  Especially when it comes to graphics, or music 
stuff.

OSX definitely runs faster and smoother on the 600 -- not that it 
won't run on the 500, but somehow it just seems to be a more natural 
&quot;fit&quot; on the 600.  Does it run faster enough to justify spending a 
little more money?  My own opinion is definitely YES.  I don't like 
looking at spinning beach balls!

It doesn't seem like the small jump between 500mhz and 600mhz would 
make so much difference, but as someone else pointed out, there is a 
jump in bus speed and also an improved video card.  The combination 
of these things makes the speed difference noticeable and measurable 
-- it's real and it pays off in daily use.

I've been checking prices recently, on Powerbook Central's &quot;For Sale&quot; 
forum, as well as several other sites.  The price differential 
between the 500 and the 600 is very small these days.  If there is 
any way you can spring for the difference, I think you'll be very 
satisfied.

I REALLY like the ruggedness of these iBooks!  Mine gets hauled 
around constantly, and just keeps on ticking!  I don't intentionally 
abuse it, but I also never feel like I have to &quot;baby&quot; it, either. 
Very, very nice machines....

Cheers -
RJLaue
