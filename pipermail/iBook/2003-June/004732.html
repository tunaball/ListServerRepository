&gt;<i> Looking back over the past couple months, this has totally changed the way I
</I>&gt;<i> work with my computers... opting to work from the apartment balcony or from
</I>&gt;<i> bed, or one of the many cafe's just a block or two away... my PC has been
</I>&gt;<i> basically ignored in that time-- much to the joy of my girlfriend, who finally
</I>&gt;<i> gets a turn. I've found XP to have become instantly awkward to use, (even more
</I>&gt;<i> so than before!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Join the iBook Brigade - we work anywhere. Just be sure you stack far enough
away from the pool splashes! Insurance companies take a dim view of drowned
computers. (Had a client experience it.) I agree that XP is very clunky
compared to the Mac. The thing that constantly amazes me is how much Windows
makes me work its way and how much the Mac just lets me work.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are only a couple things I haven't been able to do with the iBook--
</I>&gt;<i> change settings on my ISP account, or apply for a student loan online-- both
</I>&gt;<i> 'required' a windows version of IE. I'd just log into my XP box via Remote
</I>&gt;<i> Desktop Connection and do it that way. No problems, there, but hopefully Mac
</I>&gt;<i> support is coming.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Been there done that. When my local bank changed its website and could only
be used via Exploder I visited the bank and was told that internal research
showed we Mac users were a minority. Too small to be reckoned with. I asked
if the research had looked beyond mere numbers and got a blank look so I
expanded on the idea. Say Mac web users make up 5% of the bank's web usage
but because we tend to be upscale we actually account for a much larger
proportion of profits. Had anyone compared Mac users to account activity,
loans, savings, etc? Within a week the website had a link for Mac users to
access the old system while they made changes to the new one. Whenever I see
needless, as one website calls it, Macrimination I fight back.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The one thing that does bother me is a mild aesthetic problem, and this is
</I>&gt;<i> more nitpicking on my part than anything else-- the screen bezel or frame
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be warped, so that when closed, it's noticeably bent:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www3.telus.net/public/araad/">http://www3.telus.net/public/araad/</A> (see photos). It came this way out of the
</I>&gt;<i> box, and I didn't think to take photos at the time, so if it's becoming more
</I>&gt;<i> pronounced, it's happening slowly. I think, sadly, the gap is growing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Someone (perhaps you) has mentioned this before. I took a look at the two
iBook labs we have and about half are a bit warped - 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch.
Mine is very small and hasn't changed in the year I've owned it. My Duo was
similarly warped - it is still in use.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've always lifted the screen by the centre-- just behind the latch. I lift
</I>&gt;<i> the laptop itself on either side of the keyboard. Has anyone else had this
</I>&gt;<i> happen? Am I stuck with it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, as I'd said, I'm quite satisfied-- it's easily the best purchase
</I>&gt;<i> I've made in a long time. I look forward to Panther-- maybe I'll buy that RAM
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade, then.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>So how much RAM are you using now?

All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by frost.
