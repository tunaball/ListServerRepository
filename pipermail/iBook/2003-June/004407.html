<PRE>Thanks Tom .. That sure is a great tool that has so far never caught my
attention ... I also bet that my ISP techj support has never heard of it (I
hear that I am the first ISDN customer here using mac ... I think I shjould
charge them consulting fee .. Which of course I will share with the whole
group here :) 

Well .. Network util is nice .. But in some ways just replicates what I see
in the browser ... Sometimes I get lots of funky results .. Must of the time
I get &quot;host not found&quot; .. And no info where it chokes ..

But knowing this tool is great ammunition against those evil ISP people !

</I>&gt;<i> 1 millisecond, you have a problem with your own computer.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> get a line showing a connection to the ISDN router/modem (I assume
</I>&gt;<i> traceroute would show such, but haven't ever used ISDN so can't
</I>&gt;<i> say for sure), but showing no IP addresses after that, it would
</I>&gt;<i> seem to mean the problem is the connection between that router and
</I>&gt;<i> the ISP.  And so on.

</I>&gt;<i> Network Utility is a gui for standard command line commands.  If the

</I>&gt;<i> really don't have *any* clue, these are the 1st things to try.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I'll note that sometimes traceroute seems to choke, and I have to
</I>&gt;<i> do a ping 1st to find a route, or vice versa, on my OS 10.1.4 iBook,
</I>&gt;<i> which has been too irregular for me to figure out any definite
</I>&gt;<i> explanation for and not worth the trouble until after I upgrade to
