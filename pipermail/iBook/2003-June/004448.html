Almost, but not quite.

16-bit addressing does give you 65536 addresses. Computers do indeed start
counting at 0, so that means you have addresses 0 through 65535.

&gt;<i> So no matter how big the hard drive was, you could only have 65535 files

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On a 250 MB hard drive, this was no big deal--each sector is about 4k big.
</I>&gt;<i> If your file is 4k, it takes up 1 sector, if it is 12 it takes up 3, and if
</I>&gt;<i> it is 13k it takes up 4.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Divide that by 65535 and you get 16k per sector. So your 4k file would
</I>&gt;<i> actually occupy 1 16k sector, your 12k file would take up 1 sector, and a
</I>&gt;<i> 17k file would take up 32k (2 sectors).

&gt;<i> Back in the day when MS word files used to be less than 1MB, (usually only
</I>&gt;<i> 4k or 7k), this would waste a lot of space! So, people would partition
</I>&gt;<i> larger drives to be able to recover some of that valuable space.

&gt;<i> I find it conventient to have different operating systems on different

</I>&gt;<i> You can change operating systems on one partition without affecting another.
</I>
Linux must be installed on a different partition, because it uses a
different file system.

OS X and OS 9, however, don't bite each other; they will not harm one
another by being on the same partition. Of course a user in one OS can hose
the installation of the other, but partitioning doesn't prevent that.
