First, it should be noted that Apple has re-released the security 
update now, so the possibility of problems should now be moot. 
Re-download it and update if you're nervous or actually having problems 
(I never did, but I'm charmed when it comes to this sort of thing).

As for &quot;apps I can't live without,&quot; at the top of my list would be 
Cocktail, a FREE system utility that goes beyond Disk Utility but stops 
short of replacing DiskWarrior. Essential, PARTICULARLY after system 
updates (just today Apple published a KB note admitting their software 
updates don't check for directory damage prior to installing).

I find the iTunes Music Store essential, but that comes with your 
machine (or is downloaded from Apple for free).

I use Cocoa eFax for my (very modest) fax sending/receiving needs. Best 
$10 I've spent on shareware in a long time. Some folks say PageSender 
is better, but it's $30 and so far I've seen no reason to change from 
Cocoa eFax.

This may sound funny, but I consider a couple (just a handful) of 
simple (not big honkin' 3D type) games to be &quot;essential.&quot; They keep me 
amused on train trips, they help pass the time when I'm on hold, they 
occupy me on those rare occasions when I'm waiting on the computer to 
finish something like a big download or cloning operation ... I like 
BOOM, MacMAME, JewelToy, MacPipes X, Otto Matic (okay that's a 3D one 
but I love it!), SNES 9x, and the evil Snood.

I can think of a lot more but I'll stop there for now.

&quot;With the introduction of the new iTunes Music Store, we've now built 
the  first real complete ecosystem for the digital music age. We've got 
a way to buy music online legally that's fantastic -- it's better than 
any other way to acquire music. We've got a way manage music with the 
iTunes  Jukebox, which is the best in the world. And we've got a way to 
listen to music on the go with the iPod, which is the most popular MP3 
player in the world and one of the coolest things in the world. So 
we've really got, from one end to another, a complete solution for 
digital music. We're the only people in the world to do this, so we 
feel great about it.&quot; -- Steve Jobs, Time Magazine, 30-April-03
