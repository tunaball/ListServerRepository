<PRE>There is a SCSI Jaz converter to Firewire. I use it for old data I have
stored on Jaz disks. I have over a 1,000 of them, so this converter made
sense for me. I got it from Iomega. I also have one of their converters for
a zip drive, also Firewire. Both work well. I have converters in my office
and my studio at home because I only like to bring my laptop. All the
peripheral stuff weighs to much.

Try www.tigerdirect.com. Attached is a price list of their pen drives. 
A 128Mb can be obtained for $19.99 (after $20 rebate).

Among my other duties, I oversee about 100 Macs of various kinds in an 
education setting. We have a lot of problems with Zip drives and Zip 
disks (I think they're born to die) and
we are now recommending USB pen drives to our students for transporting 
their work. Zip disks may be cheaper, but they aren't as reliable. 
There are no moving parts in a USB pen drive. I'm not saying they're 
indestructible, but as a test, I threw one against a wall repeatedly, 
have carried it around in my pocket for days on end, and haven't had a 
failure. I haven't had the nerve to try sending it through the washer 
and dryer yet. And, lets not forget how portable they are. Some of the 
newer ones I've seen have removable flash storage cards.
