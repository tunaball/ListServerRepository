<PRE>There are several platforms or stands that one can use for the iBook. It 
all depends upon what you want to do. I'd divide them into five basic 
categories, with subcategories in some cases. I personally have the 
iCurve, the IceStation, and both sizes of CoolPads. I have seen/handled 
the Dexia Rack. Use the links below to find out more--I've checked that 
they all work.

<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">gslusher at rio.com</A>


1. Stands that elevate the iBook on a desk and are intended to be used 
with an external keyboard &amp; mouse/trackball (a MUCH better solution 
ergonomically)--these are great for people who use a laptop exclusively.

   - For a fixed location (not really portable)

   * Griffin iCurve $40
     <A HREF="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/icurve/index.html">http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/icurve/index.html</A>
     Very attractive. Can store the keyboard under the iBook. Not really 
for typing directly on the iBook. Fixed height.
     
   * MacMice iPerch   $39
     <A HREF="http://www.macmice.com/iperch.html">http://www.macmice.com/iperch.html</A>
     Also nice-looking, but not as elegant as the iCurve IMO. They make 
the point that it's easier to type on the iBook on the iPerch than on the 
iCurve. I expect that it is, but anyone who wants to type on it at that 
height needs his/her head examined. Fixed height.

   * DV Forge DVBase Ti  $80
     <A HREF="http://www.macmice.com/dvbaseti_1.html">http://www.macmice.com/dvbaseti_1.html</A>
     HEAVY duty; nice looking; shouldn't type on it. Can't put the 
keyboard under it for storage. Fixed height (may be a bit low, based upon 
the pictures).

   * LapVantage Dome  $80
     <A HREF="http://www.lapvantage.com/dome">http://www.lapvantage.com/dome</A>
     One of the stranger-looking stands. It's modeled after the 
flatpanel/volleyball iMac. It does adjust a bit, unlike the fixed stands. 

   * ErgoKomfort Laptop-Desktop Stand  $50
     <A HREF="http://www.ergokomfort.com/laptop.html">http://www.ergokomfort.com/laptop.html</A>
     Adjustable. Level surface. Can't put the keyboard under the laptop, 
though they make a wider version called the &quot;Monitor Stand&quot; that would 
work.

   * Googie SmartLap  $65
     <A HREF="http://www.googiestore.com/shop/default.asp?SetLng=3">http://www.googiestore.com/shop/default.asp?SetLng=3</A>  (for US)
     Click on &quot;Accessories&quot; in the list to left, then on &quot;SmartLap.&quot; 
Fixed height, level surface. (BTW, Googie has some of the wildest-looking 
Firewire HDs around.) 


   - Portable

   * MacAlly IceStation $20
     <A HREF="http://macally.com/spec/specialites/accessories/icestation.html">http://macally.com/spec/specialites/accessories/icestation.html</A>
     Doubles as a book holder or copy holder; somewhat adjustable, though 
only the lower &quot;slots&quot; will work with an iBook. If you put the support in 
one of the more upright positions, the iBook's screen will tilt forward 
at the top, as the iBook can't open far enough.

   * MacMice iTilt  $13
     <A HREF="http://www.macmice.com/itilt_1.html">http://www.macmice.com/itilt_1.html</A>
     Really cheap, simple. I'm a bit leery of its stability, as it uses 
pressure-fit and high-friction to hold the adjustment, rather than 
locking into position as with the IceStation and others.

   * Dexia Design Dexia Rack  $45
     <A HREF="http://www.dexiadesign.com/pages/581369/index.htm">http://www.dexiadesign.com/pages/581369/index.htm</A>
     Can also fit in category 3. Metal, folds up. May not fit in your 
laptop bag, as it is at least 13&quot; long. Often found in college 
bookstores. Fixed height. Keyboard may fit underneath the rack.


2. Stands that raise the iBook a little bit, primarily to help keep it 
cool. Most of these are portable. You type directly on the laptop.

   * RoadTools CoolPad $20/$30
     <A HREF="http://www.roadtools.com/">http://www.roadtools.com/</A>
     PodiumPad ($30) is adjustable; Traveler CoolPad ($20) is smaller, 
not adjustable and doesn't elevate the iBook as much. Both swivel 360 
deg, which none of the others do, and are available in black or white. 
You can use a CoolPad &quot;backwards&quot; if you like a negative keyboard angle, 
which the ergonomic experts say is better for your hands. You'd better be 
a good touch typist, though, as it's hard to see the keyboard.

   * MacAlly IcePad $30
     <A HREF="http://macally.com/spec/specialites/accessories/icepad.html">http://macally.com/spec/specialites/accessories/icepad.html</A>
     Adjustable (5 angles). Can also be used on your lap.

   * Laptop Desk 2.0 $30
     <A HREF="http://www.lapworksinc.com/laptopdesk2f.html">http://www.lapworksinc.com/laptopdesk2f.html</A>
     This looks a lot like the IcePad; they may be the same thing in 
different colors. 5 angles. Can also be used in your lap.

   * Koolsink  $20 (Stainless steel); $40 (aluminum)
     <A HREF="http://www.koolsink.com/index.html">http://www.koolsink.com/index.html</A>
     Talk about minimalist! This is a sheet of metal bent in a few 
places. It looks a bit bulky, but, cleverly, if you turn it upside down, 
it fits right around the laptop and probably takes less room than other 
stands. 

   * MobileGear E-leg    $30
     <A HREF="http://www.mobilegear.com/item549.htm">http://www.mobilegear.com/item549.htm</A>
     Minimalist--props up the back of the laptop. Doesn't directly 
support the front edge.

   * ALZAmela       $32
     <A HREF="http://www.alzamela.com/products_ib12.html">http://www.alzamela.com/products_ib12.html</A>

   * WorkRite/Travelite 2400 $133
     Site a bit confusing.


3. Stands that are intended for use while sitting on the floor or on a 
couch/chair. They straddle your legs/lap and raise the laptop. They're 
not great ergonomically, but they do avoid scorching your lap and are 
much more stable. Some are somewhat portable, though they are 
heavier/bulkier than the ones above.

   - Level surface--a &quot;lap desk&quot; of sorts

   * Levenger  Lap Desk  $40
     
<A HREF="http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/PRODIDPG.ASP?Category=1-5-5-5">http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/PRODIDPG.ASP?Category=1-5-5-5</A>
&amp;PageID=101-114-7-614&amp;Level=2-3-3-3&amp;special=&amp;C=&amp;L=&amp;SPCID=&amp;Title=
     Not specifically for laptops, but will work with them. Really 
nice-looking and surprisingly affordable, considering that it's from 
Levenger. Sits on the arms of a chair, so not suitable for floor or a 
large couch. NOT portable, unless you don't mind carrying a snowboard 
around.

   * Intrigo Lapstation  $50 - $140
     <A HREF="http://www.lapstation.com/index.html">http://www.lapstation.com/index.html</A>
     Folds up for carrying, though is a bit bulky. Price varies depending 
upon features and materials. 

   * Dexia Design Dexia Rack $43 (See above)

    
   - Tilted surface

   * LapGenie  $25
     <A HREF="http://www.lapgenie.com/">http://www.lapgenie.com/</A>
     Highly adjustable--also has XL model.

   * Laptop Laidback   $89
     <A HREF="http://www.laptop-laidback.com/product.html">http://www.laptop-laidback.com/product.html</A>
     unusual design; can be used while lying down.


4. Pads/stands/whatever that are designed to be used directly on your 
lap, to protect you from the heat and give a bit more stable platform. 
(Also see the IcePad above.)

   * LapBottom      $25 
     <A HREF="http://www.lapbottom.com/">http://www.lapbottom.com/</A>

   * Laptop Desk 1.0 $25
     <A HREF="http://www.lapworksinc.com/laptopdesk2f.html">http://www.lapworksinc.com/laptopdesk2f.html</A>
     Doesn't elevate laptop.

   * J R Hill Lap Protector $43
     <A HREF="http://www.jrhillandcompany.com/product.asp?0=200&1=222&3=102">http://www.jrhillandcompany.com/product.asp?0=200&amp;1=222&amp;3=102</A>
     Leather; thick pad. Check the site for other interesting accessories.

   There are also several makers of &quot;traditional&quot; lap desks, which are 
essentially a pillow with a smooth, hard top. Some of these are sturdy 
enough for a laptop.


5. Stands that sit on the floor and put the laptop at a usable height. 
Some of these are really small rolling desks. Others are portable, rather 
like folding music stands. Some are really clever. Most have several 
options; none are cheap.

   * InStand
     <A HREF="http://www.instand.com/">http://www.instand.com/</A>
     Portable, folds like a music stand

   * Flighttable 
     <A HREF="http://www.onlineorganizing.com/Product_Flightable.htm">http://www.onlineorganizing.com/Product_Flightable.htm</A>
     This is a rolling piece of luggage with a fold-out table attached to 
the back, for working in an airport, I guess.

   * AirDesk
     <A HREF="http://www.airdesks.com/specs.html">http://www.airdesks.com/specs.html</A>

   * RollaDesk
     <A HREF="http://www.users.bigpond.com/ark000/roller-desk.htm">http://www.users.bigpond.com/ark000/roller-desk.htm</A>

   * Rolling Laptop Assistant
