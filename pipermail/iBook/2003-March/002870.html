<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Norman Milsner
</I>&gt;<i> Removing programs in OSX in not much different than in OS 9, just
</I>&gt;<i> finding where they are is difficult.
</I>
Rubbish. All Mac OS X programs are in one of three places:

1. The Applications Folder (/Applications)
2. The User's Applications Folder (Home/Applications)
3. The System Folder (/System, and that is of course only for &quot;apps&quot; 
like the OS itself)

and their preferences and related whatnot are to be found in one of 
four places:

1. The Preferences Folder (/Library/Preferences) &lt;-- broadly speaking, 
system prefs only here
2. The User's Preferences Folder (Home/Library/Preferences) &lt;-- this is 
where 99% of the preferences are
3. Much more rarely, you might find files in &quot;Application Support&quot; 
(/Library/Application Support or Home/Library/Application Support).

It should be noted that if the main application is removed, *all* 
subordinate files become INERT and cannot be activated. This is 
different that Windows, so it should not be considered mandatory to 
remove every last vestige of a program unless you really feel that you 
want to.

This isn't really any more complicated than it was in OS 9. Programs 
could be located literally ANYWHERE (some in Applications, some in 
Internet Applications, some in Utilties, some in the Apple Menu, some 
on the desktop, some in the System Folder, etc etc etc), and as far as 
preferences and emphemera go, it's a VAST improvement (Extensions, 
Preferences, Application Support, Printer Drivers, program folder, 
printer support, desktop, to name but a few possibilities). It's 
better, and it's different. That's all.

&quot;Of course the people don't want war ... But after all, it is the 
leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a 
simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a 
fascist dictatorship or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship ... 
Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of 
the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are 
being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and 
exposing the country to greater danger. It works the same way in any 
country.&quot;
