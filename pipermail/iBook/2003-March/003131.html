I was in the same situation that you are, but I took a slightly 
different solution.  Instead of buying an external drive, I purchased a 
replacement 40GB internal drive (2.5&quot; IDE) and a firewire drive case 
for a 2.5&quot; IDE drive.  Then, I replaced the 10GB drive in the iBook and 
placed my old drive in the firewire case.  I now use the 10GB drive to 
do nightly backups of my home folder.

The upside to this approach is that you don't have any additional gear 
to carry with you, and can use all of the additional storage space 
offered by the larger drive while on the go.  (Right now, I've still 
got ~22GB free on the internal drive.)  The downside is that you may be 
able to get a larger or faster drive if you go external.  You will also 
need to be willing to swap the drive in an iBook or find someone to do 
it for you - it's not impossible, but it takes some time, a bit of 
patience, and a good set of small screwdrivers.  Swapping the hard 
drive will also void your warranty - however, if you didn't purchase an 
extended warranty that shouldn't matter anymore.

Best of luck!

Zach Heaton
