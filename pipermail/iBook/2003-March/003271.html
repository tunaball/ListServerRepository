<PRE>&gt;<i> There are two questions here, Can you reboot into 9.2 and when you are
</I>&gt;<i> in X can you open the Classic Preference Panel and see your OS 9 system
</I>&gt;<i> as a high lightable line in the scrolling list. Since you aren't
</I>&gt;<i> interested in semantics and thus did not make a clear answer, I will
</I>&gt;<i> ask again.
</I>Sorry about the semantics comment. I am really getting frustrated! I 
take pride in the fact that I'm quite good with computers and this one 
has me totally stumped! I just haven't had to do any troubleshooting in 
OS X! It's soooo stable!

Yes, I can boot into 9.2 -- consistently -- with no problems. When I 
try to start Classic from the Classic Preference Panel, I get the exact 
same message, &quot;Sorry, a system error occurred. &quot;System&quot; error type 102 
To temporarily turn off extensions, restart and hold down the shift 
key.&quot; With a button that says &quot;Restart&quot;. If I click on restart, it 
tries to start, and then ends in the same message. The pull-down menu 
looks different to me than what I recall seeing before -- Under the 
Start/Stop tab, I have iBook HD, with a down arrow (triangle) next to 
it, and underneath that it says &quot;System Folder&quot;. Above that in bold 
print it says &quot;Classic is starting from &quot;/iBook HD/System Folder&quot;  Is 
that the correct system folder? Or is it ignoring my folder with 9 and 
looking in the OS X folder? Underneath the tab Memory/Versions, it says 
&quot;Mac OS: NA, Classic Support: NA, Classic Enabler: NA, Classic 
Environment: NA.&quot; OOPS -- I guess those look about the same on my 17&quot; 
flat-panel iMac that isn't having problems. So I guess everything there 
&quot;looks&quot; okay.

&gt;<i> The reason for the question is that if you cannot start classic from
</I>&gt;<i> the Preference pane, then you probably have a corrupt Start Classic
</I>&gt;<i> file, one with bad permissions or a corrupt preference file.
</I>Is there a plist that I can delete? I cannot start Classic under my son 
Andy's login, either.

&gt;<i> One easy try is to open Disk Utility and select your OS X volume and
</I>&gt;<i> then click on Repair Preferences. This resolves a ton of problems that
</I>&gt;<i> can drive people crazy and I am beginning to think it is almost
</I>&gt;<i> required after a freeze, crash or whenever one begins to have problems.
</I>Did you mean Repair Permissions? I don't see a spot for Repair 
Preferences. I Repaired Permissions this morning -- and that didn't 
help.

Other ideas? (Short of installing CrossWord Wizard on my Windoze at 
school and forgetting about Classic entirely!)

Joyce
