<PRE>&gt;<i> I am not sure if this will help much, but system error -192 (not +192!)
</I>&gt;<i> means Resource not found.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that those extra files that make OSX start Classic are 
</I>&gt;<i> missing,
</I>&gt;<i> and that it somehow is you OSX-installation that is hosed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I first started Classic on any of my computers, I would get a 
</I>&gt;<i> message
</I>&gt;<i> that OSX needs to copy some files to the system folder. Do you 
</I>&gt;<i> remember if
</I>&gt;<i> it did so, and did you let it do it? That could be a cause too of 
</I>&gt;<i> course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, I know I did. For the first six months or so (April - Sept.) I 
would start Classic regularly in order to get my Epson Digital Camera 
to upload photos as it wouldn't work under OS X. I didn't take many 
pictures through the fall, and then when I went to upload my Christmas 
photos, &quot;suddenly&quot; Classic won't start. At the time, I decided to avoid 
the problem by buying a card reader. Now, I need to run Crossword 
Wizard, the only app I use that's not available in OS X, so the problem 
has resurfaced.

&gt;<i> That you can boot into OS9 is very helpful to know, and here the 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics
</I>&gt;<i> are quite important for us who try to troubleshoot, I was a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> confused
</I>&gt;<i> about that message from you too, but I am glad I found out what you 
</I>&gt;<i> mean.
</I>Sorry. I get really frustrated with X. I used to be able to trouble 
shoot 9 -- and often got paid for fixing my friends' computers. This is 
bugging me beyond belief! I can boot into 9.2 -- consistently. It is 
just Classic that won't start.

&gt;<i> Did you try to repair permissions? (Sorry if this was already 
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned.. It
</I>&gt;<i> was a too long week for me.)
</I>No, I've NEVER done this, in spite of owning the iBook for almost a 
year. Did that first thing this morning and there were a LOT of 
permissions that needed correcting. Wow! I had seen discussion of this, 
but sort of figured that if I wasn't having any real problems with the 
iBook, everything was probably okay. Was I ever wrong! HOWEVER, that 
did not solve the problem.

I decided that since Classic is an OS X app, I would try reinstalling X 
-- so last night I did an &quot;Archive&quot; and install. That didn't help at 
all, and Classic still won't start.

Other suggestions?

Joyce
