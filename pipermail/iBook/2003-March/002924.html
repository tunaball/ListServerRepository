<PRE>I know for a fact that my son ( 14 ) has learned a LOT more than I did 
at his age. Not that I let on, though!
One of the issues is the incredible load of heavy  books the kids are 
carrying. It is hoped that as subjects are switched to computer this 
will lessen. This sounds trivial but it is not, I have to strain to 
pick up my sons backpack and he never carries them all. I live near 
Henrico county and the program has had mixed reviews in the local media 
but all the kids and parents I have talked to like it. They are very 
tight on what can be put on the iBooks, they are treated as very nice 
tools, not toys. Some teachers don't like it, others love it, but most 
seem to just accept them as yet another change to adapt to. I know that 
some of the homework/projects my son has had would have been nearly 
impossible to do in the timeframe allowed without the computer. My son 
has had friends that had Playstations but no computer. Some people live 
in a world where they never use a computer and don't understand why 
their kids should need one, others just can't afford it.
