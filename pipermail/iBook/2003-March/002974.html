ack! That was one of two sigs not &#8216;plain texted&#8217; Better now?

What I wrote was:

How you jump to the impression that we are talking about letting 
someone slide through is beyond me. Perhaps you are example of someone 
whose primary learning style isn&#8217;t reading? Note that I said, and I 
quote myself:

&#8220;...even among the literate, learning by reading as the *dominate* 
learning style is not common.&#8221;

We aren&#8217;t talking about sliding through. We are talking about utilizing 
every method possible to help someone learn. If I give the average 
*literate* student a chapter to read, he will retain about 45% of the 
information. If I add diagrams and pictures (where appropriate) perhaps 
a film clip and other appropriate learning experiences I can boost 
retention to over 90%. Now, am I dumbing it down here? I think not.

I&#8217;m not talking about telling people they don&#8217;t have to read. Far from 
it. Although society as a whole certainly seems to be telling kids 
reading isn&#8217;t important, I am not part of that crowd.
