<PRE>&gt;<i>  &gt; 1. Printing. I can no longer print to my LaserWriter (the original 45
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  pound beast). I found an open source print driver at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Linux_printing.org but it always prints with a grey background. Are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  there any other options?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Try Gimp-Print. You can find it via Versiontracker.com. How is your
</I>&gt;<i>laserwriter connected to your iBook? Perhaps all you need is the
</I>&gt;<i>built-in CUPS printing.
</I>
Gimp-print does not have drivers for my LaserWriters. I did find a 
CUPS driver for the LaserWriter Plus but it prints a grey background 
behind everything. I have been unable to find any kind of OS X driver 
for the LaserWriter 300.

&gt;<i>  &gt; 2. Scanning. I used to be able to use the fancy scanning program that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  came with my EPSON Perfection 1660 Photo under classic. Now it can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  find the scanner (exact message is &quot;Cannot find the Scanner on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Bus). Where did it go?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You probably need to reinstall the driver. You may also need to update
</I>&gt;<i>your Classic to 9.2.2.
</I>
I will try that. Classic is running on 9.2.2.

&gt;<i>Was your OCR program working before in Classic?
</I>
Yes it was however, it is tied to the scanning program (that is, I 
can't seem to get it to work on pre-scanned files).

&gt;<i>get the updated program. Otherwise, it may not work anymore. Apple
</I>&gt;<i>changed the menubar API to make it more difficult for non-Apple menu
</I>&gt;<i>apps to get up there. I guess they feared &quot;menu overload.&quot; However, I
</I>&gt;<i>run several such apps (Weatherpop for example) which work fine.
</I>
I'll look for one.

&gt;<i>  &gt; 6. System Issues. I don't remember the finder crashing with 10.1. But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  it happens every couple of days with 10.2. When I boot into single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  user mode I get the error &quot;Extension
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  com.apple.iokit.IOSCSIArchitectureModel Cannot be found&quot; and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  different prompt than before &quot;sh-2.05a#&quot; Does anybody know what is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  happening?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is VERY ABNORMAL. Since you mention that you've repaired
</I>&gt;<i>permissions and run fsck, the only thing I can suggest is that your
</I>&gt;<i>installation is damaged. I would suggest that you try a clean install
</I>&gt;<i>(will not overwrite your old system). Did you by chance copy your 10.1
</I>
Yikes! When I get some time I will try a clean install. Is that now 
called Archive and install? That is what I wanted to do when I 
installed Jag but it did not give me that option.

&gt;<i>system from another machine, one that had a SCSI port or a SCSI card in
</I>&gt;<i>it?
</I>
Nope. I bought the book new with 10 on it

Much thanks for other bits of valuable information,

Mark
