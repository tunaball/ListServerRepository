Thursday I went back to the Sprint store where I bought my Merlin C201 
card after assuring the salesman I knew it would work and agreeing that 
he had done an excellent job of advising me that it wouldn't. We agreed 
that I could bring it back for a full refund when it didn't work.

I had asked the tech guy to install it on a Windows machine for me and 
he muttered it wouldn't work and that he had done all he was taught how 
to do.

When I returned, I first showed the sales man how to start the mack and 
then select the Connect item from the phone menu and he was amazed when 
the browser window started displaying a site. He tried a few of his 
favorites (I think he is a hacker).

Then he called in the tech guy who stood quietly in back watching and 
then left without saying much.

The Merlin c201 is a PC Card modem working with Sprint that I can use 
anywhere, anytime that I can get a Sprint connection. It works in a PC 
Card slot so it won't work with an ibook.
