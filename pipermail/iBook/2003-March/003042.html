</I>
Even Average Joe couldn't do his daily routine on a computer from 1984, so
your argument is only valid up to a point. No doubt that most users never
use all the horsepower of today's machines, but then again, most users don't
even own today's machines; they have older computers.

Then again, there are always those that can use every last bit of computing
power. When I type &quot;ant&quot; on my iBook, CPU and HD usage go up to 100%, and
stay like that for some 5 minutes. I hope that with the new 12&quot; PowerBook,
they will be like that for only 2.5 minutes. That should save me much
twiddling of thumbs during a day. I'm sure there are others who can save
time in a similar manner by having a computer that is simply much faster
than what they have today.

&gt;<i> I bought the iBook not because I needed a faster machine, I just needed
</I>&gt;<i> mobile computing.  I was tired of being tied to one room of my house to surf
</I>&gt;<i> the net, check my email and write emails like this one.  Oh yeah, I wanted a
</I>&gt;<i> computer that was designed to take a little abuse.  The iBook was the
</I>&gt;<i> perfect, cost effective choice.
</I>
It was for me, too, a year and a half ago. Didn't want or need the &quot;bulky&quot;
TiBook, so I went for small, and sturdy. Now that small and sturdy is
available with much more horsepower...

PS: Please don't quote the entire list footer in your replies, it gives me
RSI from all the scrolling to get to the actual content. ;-)
