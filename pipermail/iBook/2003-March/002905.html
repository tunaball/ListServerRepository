<PRE>Andy

here in my division in manitoba  we have 2 techs  1 computer cordinator and
in at least half the division we have one computer in every classroom  plus
at least one lab of 20.  larger schools have more then one lab.

the total number of computers is in total over 600, my half being at least
300 macs in a wide area network.

i find at times the technology is under utilized based on what is available.
i have been out of high school close to 20 years with most of those years
since being spent in the computer field at one level or another.

i guess that in part is my reason for having my opinions they way they are.
for when i was in school we where not so fortunate.
What i find is the teachers not having enough time to properly use the
technology, and thus the kids dont properly use it.  those that have a keen
interest in them do much better.
it would seem that if all they are going to do is type up reports and play
games online then  they would be better off with something cheaper then an
ibook or other such computer.

those teachers who are technological advanced  do have kids who are far more
advanced at the use of the computers. But to some dismay they use the
technology to cheat rather then to learn.

When i was in college and ready to learn  i would have learned a great deal
more if i had the technology and the internet that they do today but i was
not the average student.

what are school system today needs to do is foster the desires inside the
minds of todays kids. lead them in a direction they might not have thought
of and take what they do enjoy and strengthen it.  todays technology allows
this to happen much easier.

i ramble too andy.  it comes from people who want to use what we have to
farther the education of the kids.  for they are our countries future.
we cant give with one hand and take away with the other.

some say we are fortunate with our computer to student ratio.  but we also
have to use older technology   in place of what we would like to use  so
that we may balance the two together.

plus i am a old tech  growing weary of bandaid fixing some of my tecnology
or having my work undone as soon as i do it.

food for thought.. and conversation i am sure.

i welcome others comments
