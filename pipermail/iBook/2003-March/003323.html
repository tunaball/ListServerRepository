Unless you work for an Apple service provider or you are an Apple 
employee and have access to information the rest of us don't have, I'd 
like to know how came to this conclusion. Remember, lists and forums 
are likely to be filled with questions about how to fix a problem or 
pleas for help with diagnosing a problem. It is the rare person who 
posts a message saying, &quot;My iBook is now 12 months 8 days old and I've 
never had a single problem with it.&quot; Then again, I just did.

My own experience pales to that of a service provider, but I will say 
that where I work we have several mobile labs of both dual USB and 
clamshell iBooks and we've had fewer problems with these than any other 
notebooks we've used, Mac or PC. Perhaps our experience is the 
exception but then again, when I meet with other iBook using 
administrators our griping usually centers software problems - 
especially MacManager. Most of our hardware complaints involve poor 
battery life in OS X and rather flimsy keyboards - especially in the 
original clamshell design. Oh, and we were bitten by some bad memory 
cards when we upgraded to OS X but the vendor eventually came through 
with replacements.
