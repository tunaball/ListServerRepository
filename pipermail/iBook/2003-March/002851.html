</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Fran - this isn&#8217;t normal behavior for an iBook and it sounds to me as 
if you have a hardware problem. Even with stock 128mb the machine 
shouldn&#8217;t be unstable, just slow. You certainly shouldn&#8217;t remove 
anything from the System or Library folder (the library at the root 
level - where the System folder is) but you can certainly remove 
anything you want from the Application folder. (Remove, but don&#8217;t move 
- we&#8217;ll get into that later)

Here is a quick test I use to determine if I want to call AppleCare or 
spend some time looking over the machine myself. First, run DiskFirst 
Aid (boot from the OS X disk to do so) and also repair permissions. 
Restart and create a new user account. Log into that account and 
configure it for internet (or configure the printer and start up 
AppleWorks). Use the computer for a while and see if it does anything 
flaky. If so call Apple.

If not, log into the normal user account and use the computer as normal 
for a while - but avoid Classic since you have a minimal amount of 
memory. If the computer acts flaky then I&#8217;d suspect something is going 
on with your prefs or perhaps you&#8217;ve installed a program that is 
causing some trouble. Move back to the other user account and use it 
for a while. If the computer continues to be well behaved, move here 
permanently. If not, call Apple.

This is an abbreviated version of my troubleshooting style.
