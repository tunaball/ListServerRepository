I called and asked to speak to a product specialist and he said that my best
bet was to send it in and if it happened again they would replace the
machine.  He also said they would repair the chips and cracks around the
ports left by the last repair.  I told him that I am a Technology
Coordinator who just bought $11,000 worth of eMacs (which is true) and that
I was considering a $20,000 iBook Mobile Lab (which is also true) but was
unsure of that decision if these were the headaches that would be in store
for me.  I think that helped get my foot in the golden door. (I'd like to
tell myself) Anyway, we'll see if this continues to be a headache for me.
(Reaching for the tranquilizers)  ;o(
