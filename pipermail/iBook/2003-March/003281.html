Next, shutdown and hold down the shift key and reboot into X. This is 
similar to what you do in 9 to start up with your extensions off, no, 
probably more like using the extension managers to turn off all but the 
apple extensions.

It's called a safe boot and will turn off any third party stuff you've 
installed. Now try starting Classic. If it now works, you've got an 
application or extension that's not playing right. Not an unusual thing 
and one of the expected results in OS 9.

Which leads us to the question of whether or not you have an OS 9 
extension that is causing the problem and freezing classic on startup.

If the above doesn't work, boot in to 9 and open the extension manager 
and set it for opening only apple extensions.

Shutdown and boot into X.

Try starting classic.

If it now works, you've found the problem to be an extension in OS 9 
that is the culprit. Odds are that something you added to OS 9 after 
Sept is the problem maker. When OS 9 freezes on startup, it's usually 
the last thing you added that causes the problem.

A follow up survey on the 66% of American's favoring a war with Iraq 
showed that 0% of them were on the way to enlist for the war.
