<PRE>(Wandering astray of the general topic of 'ibooks'...)


Where I will easily admit putting kids and computers together is an
increasingly important goal, I look at these programs with a
skeptical eye. Having been out of high school only 5 years, myself,
I can vividly recall the state of the libraries themselves (evidenced
in 4 high-schools I'd attended in three cities-- Regina, Saskatoon, &amp;
Calgary.)

Off the top of my head, I don't recall the actual number figures, but
I can say the number of qualified(!) teacher-librarians in Alberta has
been cut by more than half in the last ten years. At least in Alberta and
Saskatchewan, budgets have been redirected toward the purchase
(and ongoing maintenance) of rooms full of Dells, while such things
as books have been ignored.

    * &quot;[In 1999] School principals reported, however, having insufficient
number of computers, lack of time for teachers to prepare lessons
using computers for learning purposes, and insufficient training
opportunities for teachers to develop skills in using computers for
learning purposes.&quot;

    * &quot;The inadequacy of library budgets is also a big concern and
many schools are being forced to choose technology over books. While
the task of managing technology often falls onto school media specialists,
most schools are staffed with just one full-time librarian to carry out the
task.&quot;
    (<A HREF="http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/9/14/index-e.html">http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/9/14/index-e.html</A>)


Imagine, upon my returning to high school in 1999/2000 to solve some
poor grades resulting from some indiscretions during my first try, having
to write a paper on the Kosovo crisis. The most recent (by far) book
the school owned discussing Yugoslavia had been published during the
reign of Marshal Tito.

I suppose I'm trying to say I'm a fence sitter: I strongly believe we need
to get tech into the hands of kids-- and if we can do it outside of the
limited capacity of the once-a-week labs, and more like the Maine program,
Great! But, would we not be better off, in the long run staffing a full time
educator who can ensure the stacks are up to date, relevant, and maintained?
One that can ensure students know how to search for information via
periodicals/journal indexing, rather than Googling somebody's GeoCities page?

I don't think half my fellow students at my college know what information
online is fit for proper research.


But, I ramble.


Brian, you're obviously closer to education than I am-- is this sort of 
situation
mirrored in Manitoba? Everybody else: Is this (as my supporting literature 
claims)
a Canadian problem, or are we experiencing these kinds of budget cutbacks
elsewhere as well?
