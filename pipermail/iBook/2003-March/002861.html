Windows has an uninstaller so that all references to the program can be 
removed from the registry. One way that Windows breaks down and slows 
down is due to a bloated/corrupt registry. The Mac has no registry so 
that problem doesn&#8217;t exist.

Open up System Preferences-&gt; login Items and take a look at what&#8217;s in 
there. The more things your computer starts up at login, the longer it 
takes for the computer to start up and become usable. (On the other 
hand, one of the joys of owning an iBook is that it isn&#8217;t necessary to 
do this often. Just put it to sleep when you are finished for the day.) 
If you have lots of stuff set to start at login, are there any that you 
really don&#8217;t need starting every time? If so, remove them from the 
login window.

Can you remove OS 9? Yes but unless you are in dire need of hard drive 
space, there is no reason to at the moment and some reason to keep it. 
Unless you start Classic, OS 9 is just sitting there on the drive. It 
takes no memory when not in use and steals no cycles from the machine.

Compared to my desktop G4, the iBook is noticeably slow to start up. 
However, since that is something I do only once or twice a month, I 
don&#8217;t let it bother me. In terms of the things I do everyday, the only 
time I really notice how much faster my desktop is is when I am 
programming in C or Java. Compile times are so much faster on the G4.

Good qualities are easier to destroy than bad ones, and therefore
uniformity is most easily achieved by lowering all standards.
