<PRE>Dale Critchley said on 3/24/03 8:54 PM:

&gt;<i>Bullies? How many times has Iraq attacked us? 
</I>
Exactly and precisely Zero times, at least, if we are talking about 
attacking the Mainland US, or territories, or even our soverign ships at 
sea.

&gt;<i>How many terrorists has Iraq
</I>&gt;<i>spawned? 
</I>
Unknown, but it is a near certainty that Saddam's government had 
absolutely nothing to do with 9/11 and Al Quaida. Yes, they approved of 
the attack, but they didn't have anything to do with it. 

&gt;<i>On 9/11/01, Pres. Bush said he'd stop terrorists and those who
</I>&gt;<i>support them. 
</I>
And, if he had the first shred of evidence that Saddam's government 
supported terrorists currently, I'd be much more willing to accept our 
pre-emptive action. But, the evidence is non-existant.

&gt;<i>Everyone supported him. Now he does just that, and *HE* is the
</I>&gt;<i>bully? I'd say the cowards who slammed planes into the towers, the Pentagon,
</I>&gt;<i>and the Pennsylvania countryside (headed for D.C.) are the bullies, who hit
</I>&gt;<i>unsuspecting victims and made sure they weren't around to face the
</I>&gt;<i>consequences.
</I>
We attacked Al Quaida's hideouts and organizational structure in 
Afghanistan, and the government there which aided and abetted their 
actions. I was supportive of the actions in Afghanistan (though I was 
skeptical that they would be successful in actually destroying 
AlQuaida.... though I think it was fairly successful) because of the 
unambiguous evidence of connection to the 9/11 attacks. 

If we wanted to identify the one nation with the will, desire, and 
ability to strike the US with a weapon of mass destruction, it would be 
North Korea. North Korea has played Bush's obsession with Iraq for huge 
benefit. By the way, we are technically still in a state of war with 
North Korea. The only reason we are not fighting is a well recognized 
cease fire there.

Paul
