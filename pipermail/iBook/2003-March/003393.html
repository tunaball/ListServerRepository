</I>That still doesn't make much sense to me. Are you asking me if I've 
seen many instances where the magnesium frame of the iBooks has been 
broken? If so, the answer is no. I just asked around the various 
service centers here in Orlando and they all say they've not see that 
at all. They have seen a number of hinge/video problems like the one 
you've described, but all the instances they've seen are from iBooks 
older than the most recent versions.

&gt;<i> Since I bought mine in January, the hinge problem apparently still

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Could it be that this was a previous model still in the sales channel? 
Again, I don't recall exactly when the latest version of iBooks came 
out. Wasn't it on or shortly after MacWorld?

&gt;<i> Do you think that apart from the hinge having a two years lifetime when

Laptops are, by their nature, subject to more abuse than desktops and 
consequently have a shorter average lifespan. However, the &quot;pinched 
video in the hinge&quot; syndrome is a manufacturing and/or design flaw, not 
the result of user abuse (generally speaking). Consequently, Apple has 
been fixing those units as they see the problem appear in in-warranty 
repairs. I don't know what their policy is on units having the same 
problem that are out of warranty. On some occasions, Apple has been 
known to fix known issues on out-of-warranty machines at no charge 
anyway as a goodwill gesture. I don't know if this policy is applied 
consistently or if it has ever been invoked on this particular problem.
