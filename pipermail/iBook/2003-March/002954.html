<PRE>Children today are too bombarded with visuals. Reading and imagination
are slipping into never never land.
In higher education, textbooks that were once written at a supposed
college level can be understood by bright 10 year olds. Dumbing down is
occurring. IN order to make more people feel successful. The college
degree today has the same equivalence that a high school diploma had 10
years ago.

How you jump to the impression that we are talking about letting 
someone slide through is beyond me. Perhaps you are example of someone 
whose primary learning style isn't reading? Note that I said, and I 
quote myself:

&quot;...even among the literate, learning by reading as the dominate 
learning style is not common.&quot;

We aren't talking about sliding through. We are talking about utilizing 
every method possible to help someone learn. If I give the average 
*literate* student a chapter to read, he will retain about 45% of the 
information. If I add diagrams and pictures (where appropriate) perhaps 
a film clip and other appropriate learning experiences I can boost 
retention to over 90%. Now, am I dumbing it down here? I think not.

I'm not talking about telling people they don't have to read. Far from 
it. Although society as a whole certainly seems to be telling kids 
reading isn't important, I am not part of that crowd.
