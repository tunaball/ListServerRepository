Yes, I don't know WHERE Ron came up with the idea that Apple &quot;has been 
having a lot of trouble with the iBooks&quot;! This is absolutely NOT TRUE.

Yes, there are some ibook out there with hinge/video problems. But 
judging from reports from Apple Service Centers and dealers in Orlando, 
it's a relatively minor problem and appears now to have been corrected 
in models available these days.

If you want an example of something that gave Apple a LOT of repair 
headaches, you could mention how easy it is to fry a CRT-based iMac via 
the electric or phone or ethernet line if you don't have them on a 
surge protector; or you could mention the widespread problem of 
excessively noisy fans on certain MDD G4 towers. You could mention the 
hairline fractures on some models of Cube. THOSE are big problems. The 
iBook has been a stellar performer (all iterations) by comparison.

&quot;Executives in the PC business use the word &quot;sexy&quot;, in such a way that 
I'm always surprised to discover that their children aren't adopted. 
The Mac interface is not &quot;sexy&quot;, and it would be grotesque to want it 
to be. It is, in fact, playful, often well over the line into 
frivolity. The bouncing icons (and the puffs of smoke and the 
pipe-organ speech synthesizer and the way dialogs tidily resize and the 
drop-shadows on the windows and the jellybean buttons and the eject key 
on the keyboard) are not individually rationalizable on utilitarian 
grounds, and they do not pretend they mean to be. They are there to, in 
aggregate, change the nature of your relationship with the device. They 
are joyful, and they hope their joy is infectious.&quot; -- Glenn McDonald
