<PRE>&gt;<i> Listmom has allowed an extremely off-topic thread to continue without
</I>&gt;<i> addressing it. Since I don't know who listmom is, or listmom's address, I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot contact listmom directly to register a complaint with listmom
</I>&gt;<i> regarding his/her lack of response (my complaint is NOT about the topic).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As such, I am forced to post my complaint to listmom publicly as this is the
</I>&gt;<i> only way I know to contact listmom.
</I>
My apologies in advance...I am really not trying to add to this thread,
moderate it, control it or generally influence anything but as you asked
above here are some answers:

The FAQ for the iBook list...

&lt;<A HREF="../../../../themacintoshguy.com/lists/iBookListFAQ.shtml">http://themacintoshguy.com/lists/iBookListFAQ.shtml</A>&gt;

The email for the listmom...taken from the FAQ

<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">listmom at lists.themacintoshguy.com</A>

and a major point that you mention...also taken from the FAQ&#160;

9. What topics may be discussed?

Anything relating to Apple's consumer portable, including speculation,
information, troubleshooting, products, and software. iBook List is an
unmoderated open list. Unmoderated means messages are sent to the list
without prior review by the list mom; open means anyone subscribed to the
list may post.

....

I cannot help but wonder aloud if there ever is such a marvel as &quot;if no one
would respond to an obviously provocative post/issue after the first initial
post would it die?&quot; in other words...most people are patiently waiting it
out and trying not to fuel the fire...

Flame on&gt;

I do actually appreciate the fact that this list is still uncensored and
unmoderated even if it means that there is the occasional dispute sent to
everyone without thought (my apologies for my contribution with this post in
advance) as it means that we still enjoy some real freedom without
bounds...and for the most part actually self govern ourselves rather well,
no? It would be nice to see this tolerance and self-control from our
governments and all people regardless of planet, age, whatever...

Flame off&gt;

Cheers,

Richard
