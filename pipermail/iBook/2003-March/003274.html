That's very weird, considering that according to
&lt;<A HREF="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=9806">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=9806</A>&gt;, that error means the
following:

102:dsOldSystem:System is too old for this ROM

Which would not make any sense, since you can boot from the same system
folder just fine.

Did you try restarting with the Shift key depressed, as suggested?

That depends... Is that your only Mac OS 9 System Folder?

&gt;<i> Or is it ignoring my folder with 9 and looking in the OS X folder?
</I>
No, it's not doing that for sure.

&gt;<i> Underneath the tab Memory/Versions, it says &quot;Mac OS: NA, Classic Support: NA,
</I>&gt;<i> Classic Enabler: NA, Classic Environment: NA.&quot; OOPS -- I guess those look

Yup. There's only any info there when Classic is running.

In the Advanced tab, try selecting the &quot;extensions off&quot; option and starting
Classic from there.

Lastly, I would suggest creating an OS 9 System Folder specifically for use
in Classic. Since a lot of services (networking, etc.) in Classic are really
handled by Mac OS X, starting Classic from a &quot;regular&quot; Mac OS 9
installations means you are loading a lot of unnecessary extensions and
control panels, which only slow down the start-up and performance of
Classic.

To install a minimal system, boot up from your OS 9 CD, choose a Custom
Install, and deselect everything except the first option in the System area
(Core Operating System, or something like that).

That'll give you a tiny (mine's only 55 MB, and that's with already some
stuff added by certain Classic apps), that starts nice and fast, and runs
cleanly, without using a big chunk of memory.
