You didn't. Somebody didn't like it, but sigs are officially not 
supposed to be argued over here, and they can be offensive as you 
want. At least that is my experience. Sigs however, despite official 
policy have touched off more than a few off-topic lengthy 
discussions. Like this one.

In an international economy, boycotting France is hard to do. Unless 
you don't fly there. For instance, the main plant for a French 
company, Dannon, is in Ohio and they are the largest yogurt producer 
in the world. The majority of their imports are in chemicals and 
other industrial materials that will be used to make products you 
never dreamed had anything French in them.

The most damaging comeback I have heard was just to open up the green 
card system for a few years for their computer people and engineers 
and scientists and the like specifically. Create a brain drain. 
That'll hurt them worse than anything and their politicos just won't 
be able to figure out why their most productive people would ever 
want to hightail it out of there and move to the US.
