</I>&gt;<i>  Hi Paul,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I got this new at a Fry's Electronics, I think they had been shipped 
some old stock to get rid of... According to all the paperwork it is 
original...not a refurbished return. I switched a year ago this month. 
My first Mac was a Mac IIci that I picked up in a Thrift shop...I 
upgraded it a bit and just recently sold it on eBay. I also have a 
MacPlus 4MB with an external HD, also a PM6116CD, a Performa 5200CD, and 
a LC550, and my daily use machine was a PM7300/upgraded to a G3 
400/4.3HD/256RAM. So, over the course of this past year I tried to 
familiarize myself with early OSs and differing styles of machines. I 
using OS 9.2.2 on the 7300 for the last 3 months until I bought this 
iBook. Even with the experience I do have, I still consider myself a Mac 
newbie.
I too, was thinking that I was just making some bone-head mistakes 
because OS 10 is so different from the others. But everyone kept telling 
me how stable it is and such so I figured I was the problem....I still 
may be! After, I upgrade the memory and do a clean install of 
everything, we'll see what happens, I guess ;-)

Thanks for the input!
Fran
