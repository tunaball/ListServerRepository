Since you stated you are guessing, your figures are useless for 
anything other than a basis for your desire to argue with someone and 
present yourself as an expert. Not that there is anything wrong with 
that since I also love to do the same...  :)

You have no idea how many books are being returned to Apple for 
service, which is excellent, and until you do, you might add the 
disclaimer to your posts, &quot;Charles Martin does not have access to the 
actual repair figures on any Apple Computer.&quot;

Since all new models are in effect beta and subject to the same 
reliability problem of any new product, it is to be expected that 
problems will appear. What is amazing is how good Apple is at fixing 
them and compared with other service providers, Apple is the best.
