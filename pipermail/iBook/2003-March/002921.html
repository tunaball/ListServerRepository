My niece Bridget is anti-Mac although her brother Brad and her Mom are 
both Macfriendly.  I asked her why, and she said that her school had an 
iBook lab and they kept breaking down.  I was puzzled and asked how.  
She said that they kept losing one key from the all the keyboards.  I 
asked her if she had a friend in one of those classes that hated Macs.  
  She was surprised I asked, and I told her it was probably vandalism.   
I don't think I convinced her but at least I planted the thought.   One 
freak in the class popping off keys just to ruin the iBook.  :(







I once thought about starting a club to discuss the philosophy of 
Fatalism.
But then I realized that even if anyone came, they'd only come to steal 
the folding chairs.
