<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Fran &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">fran at dollingers.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks Norm....I appreciate the quick reply. Thanks for the info about
</I>&gt;<i> the inability to increase program memory, that in itself was a big help
</I>&gt;<i> ;-) Unfortunately, I had already moved most of my important stuff from
</I>&gt;<i> my PM7300/upgraded to G3 400 onto the iBook when I brought it 
</I>&gt;<i> home...so,
</I>&gt;<i> I've already lost most everything.
</I>
There's no reason why you should have &quot;lost&quot; even one byte of material. 
Doing a clean reinstall of the system does NOT involve erasing the hard 
drive, so all your &quot;old&quot; files and programs should still be there 
unless you've erased the hard drive.

&gt;<i> BTW: can deleting portions of an
</I>&gt;<i> OS cause problems? I always download Netscape and then remove Internet
</I>&gt;<i> Explorer in order to get M$ free. Any idea why they put IE into the OS?
</I>
They put it there as part of a now-expired agreement between MS and 
Apple. Once Safari reaches final status I imagine they will no longer 
include IE (or they may continue to do so as a courtesy, but Safari 
will be the default).

IE is not part of the OS, but I have heard reports of problems if IE is 
completely removed. Removing &quot;portions of the OS&quot; in OS X is *not* 
recommended!!

I would suggest to you that you need to back up anything you want to 
save onto CD-R, and then (one last time) do a complete ERASE, REINIT 
and REINSTALL of the OS. In other words, get it back to EXACTLY the way 
it was the day you brought it home.

If that does not IMMEDIATELY and PERMANENTLY solve the problems you are 
having, take it in to an Apple authorised repair center.

_Chas_

&quot;Executives in the PC business use the word &quot;sexy&quot;, in such a way that 
I'm always surprised to discover that their children aren't adopted. 
The Mac interface is not &quot;sexy&quot;, and it would be grotesque to want it 
to be. It is, in fact, playful, often well over the line into 
frivolity. The bouncing icons (and the puffs of smoke and the 
pipe-organ speech synthesizer and the way dialogs tidily resize and the 
drop-shadows on the windows and the jellybean buttons and the eject key 
on the keyboard) are not individually rationalizable on utilitarian 
grounds, and they do not pretend they mean to be. They are there to, in 
aggregate, change the nature of your relationship with the device. They 
are joyful, and they hope their joy is infectious.&quot; -- Glenn McDonald
