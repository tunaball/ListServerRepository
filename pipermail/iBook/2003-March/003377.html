Wouldn't this mean that you don't get a true picture of the repair 
situation on iBooks, Powerbooks and any other Apple equipment that is 
shipped directly to Texas for repair. Your next door neighbor could 
ship his book off for AppleCare and you not be aware of it. This means 
that your statements are not very accurate as to the repair of books 
since you are only getting a small view of the actual situation.

Apple will ship a box to anyone who calls for repair and they place 
their equipment in the box and it goes to Texas (I think) and is back 
in a few days. I have shipped several books for repair, and a 17&quot; 
monitor. None of which you would have known about by checking with 
local service providers since they weren't involved. Why waste an extra 
week or so for them to handle the shipment?

With these two paragraphs in mind, I think Charles Martin's statements 
about the service problems with Powerbooks and iBooks is suspicious and 
unreliable. I doubt one could get a statement from Apple on the 
statistics of AppleCare repairs.

Someone might copy this to the list without attaching my name so he 
will see it and perhaps reply....  :)
