I use &quot;Backup&quot; and backup to iDisk every single day. I bought my iBook 
on December 19, 2003 from the Apple Store in Costa Mesa, California. 
The first one crashed 4 times and was replaced by mail by Apple by the 
3rd month after purchase. The second one crashed 3 times in the next 
few months and was replaced by the Apple store out of their inventory. 
Brand new for sure. I had that one less than an hour before the logic 
board went out. I hadn't even gone home yet. I took it back to the 
store immediately and they replaced it with my FOURTH brand new iBook 
in less than 10 months. The fourth one -- you guessed it - I just got 
back from the repair depot a few days ago. Again, a failed logic board.

I've had to pay for data transfer 3 times because the crashes happened 
right after I'd downloaded photos that I couldn't bear to lose and had 
not yet backed up. That's $150 I paid to be able to keep my pictures.

Backup backup backup -- you can't do it too often.
