<PRE>Hello all,

I have some questions and I was hoping that I would be able to get some
help from you guys before I start searching the internet.

First, my husband just bought me a previously used Key Lime Clamshell
ibook and I wanted to do a &quot;fresh&quot; install.  Basically, I want to get
the ibook back to how it was before it was purchased.  Like it had never
been used before...  so I could put all MY information in it and get rid
of all the previous owner's information.  Is this possible?  If so, how
would I go about doing it?  (I have all of the CD's that came with it).

Second, last night I had turned on the ibook and I needed a password in
order to do some software updates, so I closed the ibook (putting it to
sleep).  I sent the guy that my husband purchased the ibook from an
e-mail and *patiently* waited for a response.  I had left the ibook on
the carpeted floor.  I didn't get a response back from the man until
tonight and then when I went to get my ibook, the &quot;sleep light&quot; wasn't
flashing green, and the ibook itself wasn't showing any signs of action.
It was turned off completely.  It was also pretty warm on the bottom.  I
had left the a/c adapter plugged in all that time as well.  First I
tried to wake the ibook up by moving my finger across the track pad, and
then I tried pushing the space bar.  Since that didn't work, I pushed
the power button and nothing happened.  I waiting a few seconds and
tried again.  It still didn't work.  So I pushed the reset button near
the screen and waited ten or fifteen minutes and tried to power it on a
couple more times.  Finally, I closed the ibook and put it down and then
I heard the familiar noises of it coming to life.  

I was very happy that I didn't fry my motherboard or overheat it or ruin
it, but I am kind of worried about the whole situation.  This doesn't
seem right to me.  Does anyone have any clues as to what might have
happened?

Thanks,
Pamela

</PRE>
