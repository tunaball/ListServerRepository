I, too, am very happy with the clamshell iBook. In fact, it appears 
many potential buyers for the clamshells still exist. When I was 
ordering Panther from the Apple store, I mentioned the specs of my 
iBook in reply to the question if my computer met the requirements 
(yes). Upon learning about my tangerine iBook, the Apple rep said, &quot;We 
still get quite a few inquiries for those laptops. People will call up 
and say 'I would like to order the blue-coloured laptop,' and when they 
hear it isn't being made anymore, they insist, 'but that's the one I 
want,' and often will hang up without a purchase. I want to tell them, 
'but we have some new iBooks are very good,' but that doesn't always 
persuade them.&quot; Clearly they are &quot;one of a kind&quot; laptops for more than 
just the actual owners.

The one &quot;drag&quot; I find with my laptop, though, is weight. My wife has a 
dual USB iBook, and sometimes I'll throw hers in the backpack when she 
isn't using it as I head out, and it's a lot lighter on the shoulders. 
The difference between the two is about one and a half pounds, which 
doesn't seem like a lot with a good backpack, so maybe I'll try 
carrying the clamshell again to see if my shoulders have strengthened 
or something. :)  Otherwise, I'm a loyal clamshell user.

Jason
