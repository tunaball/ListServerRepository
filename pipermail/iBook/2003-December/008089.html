<PRE>Just thought I'd throw my two cents in, too...

I bought a 700 MHz G3 iBook in the summer of 2002.  I had owned three 
Apple laptops prior to that, and had never experienced a single problem 
with any of them, so I did not opt for AppleCare.  About five months 
out of warranty (in other words, about 5 weeks ago) the logic board 
failed, and I was faced with a $650-$700 repair.

I decided to throw in the towel and pay a little more for a new G4 
iBook instead, which I am *very* happy with.  Of course, I was very 
happy with the G3 iBook before its logic board failed, too.  :-\

Anyway, to the original poster of this thread, the iBook is too nice of 
a machine for you to regret your purchase - I predict you'll be quite 
happy with the iBook(s).   And, as others have said in this thread, if 
you read message boards and email lists, you will hear about the horror 
stories and not about the happy users, so don't let them get you too 
down.  The odds are still largely in your favor that you'll have a 
trouble-free experience.

But, it appears that Apple does have some quality control issues, so do 
yourself a favor and purchase AppleCare for the iBook(s), and back up 
your data regularly (which you should be doing anyway!!).  I learned 
the first lesson the hard way, but at least I was already in the habit 
of doing the second.

I hope you enjoy your iBook, and this list!

All the best,
Mike W.
