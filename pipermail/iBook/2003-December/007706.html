&gt;<i> I have a PowerBook on order, and I'll be using OS X for the first time.

</I>
I find that the organisation of where to find the menu topics for changing
or editing anything in the messages or accounts, etc..is easier to find in
Entourage and I may be wrong but the Mailing List manager and newsgroup
functions are missing in Mail? (if not I couldn't find them) whereas in
Entourage there are several functions to allow you to handle these type of
things easily and better within a single program. I also am a fan of
customizing the sounds for different actions (new email, outgoing, etc...)
with email and there is no end to sound sets for entourage at
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.soundsetcentral.com/">http://www.soundsetcentral.com/</A>&gt; with everything from 2001 to the
Simpsons...sure you can do this in mail to an extent but not with the same
ease.

I like to have the integration of calendar, address book and messages and
using flags for reminders of what to do at a later date with certain
messages, linking contacts to online maps, the detail available for contact
information as well as (as with all of this a personal opinion) the look and
feel of Entourage over Mail. Entourage has been using colours for marking
different items since OS 9 and everything is in one program (no need to open
3-4 different ones and try to switch between...but at the end of the day if
you are happy with Mail then there is no need to use anything else really.)
However once you use Entourage and see the interface and logical
organisation as well as the features that are lacking or hard to find in
other Apple apps then you may actually say wow MS really did do a good job
with this software...

Another point I think is important is that for using the program with just a
keyboard Entourage beats mail hands down...after using Mail for several
weeks I still couldn't go without a mouse which was annoying to say the
least when you just want to do something quick...

Besides, like many others, during business hours I am forced to use other
OS's and find that no matter how hard one tries to fight it, I end up using
MS programs at work so it is a definite advantage to know the approx.
mentality of where things are and how they are meant to be used
together...for comparison if you are an Adobe program user consider how it
is like for a newbie with Photoshop compared to someone who has been using
Illustrator before...
