<PRE>This is from the Dec. 24th Macintouch: <A HREF="http://www.macintouch.com/">http://www.macintouch.com/</A>

&gt;<i> David Shanahan offered some important tips for avoiding trouble with 
</I>&gt;<i> iBooks:
</I>&gt;<i> I recently had the video die on my 800 MHz G3 iBook for the first time 
</I>&gt;<i> when it was almost out of warranty. It was fixed, though apparently 
</I>&gt;<i> because of the high demand for iBook logic boards it took three weeks 
</I>&gt;<i> to get it back. So far it's working fine but based on others' 
</I>&gt;<i> experience this is unlikely to last.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; I started reading the Apple support forums on the subject of video 
</I>&gt;<i> failures in iBooks while I was waiting for mine to be repaired. It 
</I>&gt;<i> seems there are two basic flaws in the white (Dual USB) iBooks (both 
</I>&gt;<i> 12&quot; and 14&quot; models) which Apple seem to be studiously ignoring despite 
</I>&gt;<i> complaints about them being widespread for over a year now:
</I>&gt;<i> 	 1.  	The hinge design is faulty. Backlight, video and power cables 
</I>&gt;<i> pass through the hinge from the logic board to the screen and the 
</I>&gt;<i> holes are too small for the cable assemblies resulting in stress and 
</I>&gt;<i> friction on the cables each time the screen is opened or closed. 
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually one or more of the cables either break or the insulation 
</I>&gt;<i> wears through resulting in a short and the backlight/video fails. This 
</I>&gt;<i> is often accompanied by fuzzy lines on the screen or users finding 
</I>&gt;<i> that the screen fails when tilted at certain angles and works at 
</I>&gt;<i> others. If your video works fine when you plug the iBook into an 
</I>&gt;<i> external monitor then this is most likely your problem. There are 
</I>&gt;<i> links in the Apple support forums to a site describing in detail how 
</I>&gt;<i> to disassemble your iBook and replace such broken cables, though you'd 
</I>&gt;<i> want to be pretty confident to try this as it will of couse void any 
</I>&gt;<i> warrenty you have left.
</I>&gt;<i> 	 2.  	The video chip on the motherboard comes loose when its solder 
</I>&gt;<i> gives way leading to video failures, usually with no warning. This may 
</I>&gt;<i> be triggered by flexing of the case putting strain on the chip until 
</I>&gt;<i> it eventually comes loose (some have suggested never picking up your 
</I>&gt;<i> iBook by the left-hand side alone as this is where the video chip is). 
</I>&gt;<i> If after a video failure you plug in an external monitor and it 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't work this is most likely your problem and you need a new logic 
</I>&gt;<i> board. Some people have tried pressing down hard on the left-hand side 
</I>&gt;<i> of the case just below the option key to the left of the track pad and 
</I>&gt;<i> managed to get video back temporarily (apparently this reseats the 
</I>&gt;<i> video chip). Others have reported some success sticking rubber 
</I>&gt;<i> bands/thin foam insulation on the underside of the shielding over the 
</I>&gt;<i> video chip to protect it from flexing/pressure from the case. Seems 
</I>&gt;<i> like the case really needs to be reinforced to stop it flexing like 
</I>&gt;<i> this and/or the location and soldering of the video chip changed.
</I>&gt;<i> These problems appear to be common with every model of white iBook 
</I>&gt;<i> from the original 500 MHz up to at least the 900 MHz G3s. The new G4 
</I>&gt;<i> iBooks may have the same problem(s) but they're so new it's probably 
</I>&gt;<i> too soon to tell for sure (the hinge design has apparently not 
</I>&gt;<i> changed). [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; P.S. I'd advise readers to avoid buying 2nd hand white iBooks - many 
</I>&gt;<i> people seem to be selling theirs after the 2nd/3rd/4th logic board 
</I>&gt;<i> replacement and buying something else (not always another Apple 
</I>&gt;<i> product of couse, which has got to hurt Apple if they continue to 
</I>&gt;<i> ignore these problems).
