Not that I think THIS will happen .. But anyone else recall that at some
point at a macworld they actually RAISED the price of the 15&quot; imac by 100$
???  This is always an option too :)

Usuallsy cheaper elsewhere .. But : ... I bought extra ram for my TiBook ..
And it did not work ... I could send it back and got my money back (minus
shipping) ... And I had only 3 weeks being in the US to deal with that ...

On the other hand, if it had worked, it would have been 180$ vs 400$ plus
tax from apple ... So .. Can be quite cheaper ...

Last apple salesman told me that I can probably find the apple certified
Microtech (not sure if that was the name) cheaper online ...

If ram is defined at user instalable (which I think it is in pretty much all
models) you are not voiding your warranty one should think ...

Cheers

Rumor has it a special edition imac will come out around easter .. Base in
the shape of an egg .. Pastel colors are optional :)
