<PRE>Folks, regardless, this doesn't just apply to a few iBooks. These 
reports
are coming from good mac news/troubleshooting sources, not just me.

This JUST came in from MACFIXIT: 
<A HREF="http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20031229083510444">http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20031229083510444</A>

&gt;<i> The following is an immediate MacFixIt alert.
</I>&gt;<i> iBook screen problems: Injured wires, logic board failure (Alert 
</I>&gt;<i> Trigger: Late-Breakers)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is an issue with several iBook units involving failing displays 
</I>&gt;<i> that we first reported on in-depth in mid-March and April of this 
</I>&gt;<i> year. Since those initial postings, Apple's discussion boards and 
</I>&gt;<i> MacFixIt's forums have been inundated with similar reports, leading to 
</I>&gt;<i> the notion that there may be a serious design flaw in Apple's dual-USB 
</I>&gt;<i> iBooks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem most users are experiencing is a design flaw at the hinge 
</I>&gt;<i> to the display. Apparently there isn't enough room for the wires to 
</I>&gt;<i> pass through and handle the friction they receive by opening and 
</I>&gt;<i> closing the lid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To recap, the problem generally manifests in one of three ways:
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; 	Video &quot;art! ifacts&quot; progressing to eventual system failure
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; 	&quot;Black screen&quot; or &quot;dimming&quot; of the backlight, when screen is 
</I>&gt;<i> opened past a certain angle
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; 	&quot;Black screen&quot; or &quot;dimming&quot; of the backlight at random times, 
</I>&gt;<i> which can be temporarily solved by tapping on, or applying pressure 
</I>&gt;<i> to, the iBook case directly below the fn and control keys (to the left 
</I>&gt;<i> of the trackpad)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MacFixIt reader Peter H did an excellent take-apart analysis of the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem, yielding the following findings:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You are absolutely correct about the display hinges. The edges are 
</I>&gt;<i> sharp and they cramp the wires. As the display is opened and closed 
</I>&gt;<i> the wires are forced to bend and twist repeatedly about too small a 
</I>&gt;<i> radius. As the lid is opened they are also put into tension. The 
</I>&gt;<i> wires, such as the backlight cable, are only 7 strand and will not 
</I>&gt;<i> tolerate this repeated physical stress and will fail from fatigue / 
</I>&gt;<i> strain hardening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You are also correct about shorting to earth! . My daughter's iBook 
</I>&gt;<i> leaks high voltage through the exposed metal fasteners on the 
</I>&gt;<i> underside and she can't use it on her bare legs without getting a 
</I>&gt;<i> moderate but still intolerable electric shock. (This showed up within 
</I>&gt;<i> a few months of being purchased. Initially I thought she was joking 
</I>&gt;<i> but I have verified it and it is true. )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I repaired the broken backlight (black wire on RHS) by splicing in a 
</I>&gt;<i> new segment of more appropriate cable able to withstand repeated 
</I>&gt;<i> flexing. I also opened out the semi circular space where the wires 
</I>&gt;<i> pass through the hinge and smoothed out the sharp edges. This is a 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanical design flaw and the wrong type of cable is being used in 
</I>&gt;<i> this demanding area. Given the small dimensions inside the hinge it is 
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to resolve as a service issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Generally the (short term) solution to the problem I experienced is 
</I>&gt;<i> to replace the backlight cable, but Apple technicians are repeatedly 
</I>&gt;<i> replacing the whole display (I believe this is an er! ror in Apple's 
</I>&gt;<i> workshop manual - which I have read BTW)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I also did a thorough examination of the motherboard with a stereo 
</I>&gt;<i> inspection microscope and I see a problem with high voltage arcing 
</I>&gt;<i> across to the RF shield. The characteristic pitting was quite obvious 
</I>&gt;<i> under the microscope. (no wonder you may be exposed to an electric 
</I>&gt;<i> shock from the bare metal on the underside of the iBook). I imagine 
</I>&gt;<i> the shorting would also not help battery life. Also I noted that many 
</I>&gt;<i> of the cables are RF shielded with a finely woven metallic sheath. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is OK but I observed at the cut ends - stray fine metallic fibers 
</I>&gt;<i> which in some cases were making inappropriate contact potentially 
</I>&gt;<i> shorting out some electronic components. In my opinion, some areas of 
</I>&gt;<i> the design and fabrication are superb. Other areas leave much to be 
</I>&gt;<i> desired.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It seems Apple really needs to improve Quality Control and more 
</I>&gt;<i> stringent review of design issues. If I put out a product with these 
</I>&gt;<i> flaws I would ex! pect to lose Quality Assurance Certification.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we suggested back in March, purchasing an AppleCare extended 
</I>&gt;<i> warranty plan seems to be the best bet for virtually all new iBook 
</I>&gt;<i> buyers. Out-of-pocket iBook logic board replacements can be quite 
</I>&gt;<i> expensive. Readers have been quoted prices ranging from US$400 to 
</I>&gt;<i> US$920 for screen replacement and/or logic board repair.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One reader writes &quot;They (Apple) told me it was the logic board and 
</I>&gt;<i> that the repair would be $920. I opted to buy a new iBook/800 G4 from 
</I>&gt;<i> another source. This time I got the AppleCare program.&quot;
