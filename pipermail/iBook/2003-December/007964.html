hehe lol yeah I was surprised Panther even installed with so less RAM. 
It only said that it couldn't install 'Essentials', but it's working fine.
Trying to install Panther was just a test, because I was running 9.2.2 
before and that went fine with so less RAM. I bought this clamshell with 
only 32MB installed, I had a 64MB DIMM lying around from a tray-loading 
iMac so used that aswell. I use the clamshell for web browsing only at 
the couch in my living room (via Airport), watching DVDs in bed and from 
time to time I take the iBook with me to work or friends.  Ofcourse the 
HD gets accessed a lot which slows down the browsing. But since Panther 
is easy to work with I think I'm gonna stay with it.

&gt;<i>{Huge difference in behavior between Macs and PCs given awful 
</I>&gt;<i> working conditions   8? ) OS 9 on the clamshells chugged with only 96 
</I>&gt;<i> MBs of RAM. I know, I tried to use it to file online reports and it 
</I>&gt;<i> would take hours. As soon as I maxed the
</I>&gt;<i> RAM to 160 (top possible at the time) it was a happy camper.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How much you should invest in the laptop depends on your future plans 
</I>&gt;<i> for it and how long you will keep it. If you plan to run Panther on it, 
</I>&gt;<i> more RAM is an absolute requirement but don't get a small chip, get as 
</I>&gt;<i> much as you can afford, 256MB at a minimum and be sure to install the 
</I>&gt;<i> firmware upgrade before you install the extra RAM. Panther will work 
</I>&gt;<i> more happily on ac than with 96MB of ram.
</I>
I wanna max out the RAM so I'll be getting a 512MB DIMM soon!

&gt;<i> If you plan to keep the ibook for a year or two, RAM and a new battery 
</I>&gt;<i> (if you need portability) will be essential. Between the 2, given 
</I>&gt;<i> Panther in the mix, RAM is the most crucial purchase.
</I>
Yes I'm gonna keep the clamshell and get myself a battery and some RAM 
(see above).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If your primary use of the ibook is typing and a lot of mousing, the 
</I>&gt;<i> clamshell is still the gold standard for comfort. I have finally made 
</I>&gt;<i> peace with the icebook keyboard by using a PodiumPad to keep the 
</I>&gt;<i> pressure of the hard edge off my wrists. But using the trackpad a lot is 
</I>&gt;<i> really tough on the thumb and wrist with the icebooks and snowbooks, 
</I>&gt;<i> even the 14&quot; doesn't change that much.
</I>
Yes I agree a friend of mine has a 12&quot; 900MHz iBook and indeed is the 
clamshell more comfortable while typing, and I like the Enter key 
besides the space bar on the clamshell, first I had to get used to it, 
but now I find myself hitting the right Apple key on my friends iBook 
every time I want to 'enter' :-)
