<PRE>*** These issues of bad iBooks I've been reading on this list made me think.

Compared to what I hear from several European mailinglists and
messageboards, it seems there's some very bad karma in the US concerning our
cute little boxes. I've the impression these problems are mostly bothering
the American market. At least in such quantities.

Couldn't the problems be due to bad handling during transport or stocking in
unsuitable surrounding (too humid, too cold, too warm, difference in
temperature and condesation as a part of it)?

Taking this thought a bit further: Couldn't it be that iBooks which didn't
pass the quality test still find their way into the shops?
