</I>&gt;<i> drive? I've added additional internal hard drives to both my office and
</I>&gt;<i> home G4s and would like to use them for storage of things like this,

I did this several months ago when my wife got her new computer and we
decided to meld our two playlists. What I did was use the shareware program
&quot;iTunes Publisher&quot;. It does lotsa stuff (worth looking at) but one thing it
does is create a tab delimited file containing every album. You decide
exactly what else to include.

I created a file from each computer with group/artist name and album name.
(Telling it to ignore song titles, didn't care about them) Then I opened
these files up in AppleWorks database and sorted. That let me quickly go
through and mark the duplicates. Then I copied the non-duplicates to my
computer.
