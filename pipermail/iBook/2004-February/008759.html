<PRE>&gt;<i> Apple's baseball cap is excellent for shading the eyes from the sun. I
</I>&gt;<i> am also thinking of covering it with solar cells. If we could just
</I>&gt;<i> transmit electricity via wifi or bluetooth...
</I>
Uh, yeah that would work for your eyes, but if too much light is on the 
screen, it still is unreadable so the cap would have to be on the 
laptop and I don't think they make one that size yet. Besides, if they 
did, the rounded head part would probably cover the solar array on the 
laptop lid. If you were lucky enough that it didn't, the shadow from it 
would probably still cut down on the amount of light available to the 
array thus preventing fast or full charging.

Then of course, you have the added weight and tech complexity to say 
nothing about the fact that you would have to use it outside all the 
time for best battery results. People who work at night might have a 
few tech problems, like no sun. The increased risk factor for skin ca 
ncer could also outweigh any possible upside. It's kinda tough to type 
while you are &quot;indisposed&quot; from chemo sideeffects.

On rainy days, you're back to normal charging with ac and contending  
with the additional pieces of equipment and added weight of the Li 
battery. Snowy days with sunshine could charge the array really fast. 
The downside being the difficulty typing with gloves on while you are 
shivering, the possibility of snow blindness, or frostbite if you 
choose not to use gloves.

Of course, you could simply run the book outside and leave it until it 
charges, run inside and work provided the condensation and temp changes 
don't short out the &quot;book or cause other malfunctions, Then there's the 
problem of trying to secure a locking cable to the snow so the book 
doesn't go for a walk with the friendly passerby.

The upside to all these minor annoyances is the great list of new 
reasons you would have when you have to explain why you missed the 
deadline, don't have your home work done, etc. Running in and outside 
all day might also help to increase your fitness level which might 
offset the added risk of sun cancer. Oh, be sure you always use your 
screen protector if you decide to go with sun block lotions to cut your 
risk from sun exposure. Sun blocks can be so messy. The cost and 
inconvenience of having the 'book in for screen replacement could be a 
real bummer.
