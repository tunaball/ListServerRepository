<PRE>
I have a iBook (Clamshell) and it has a far better lcd than my Toshiba 
portable. It is by far one of the best screens out there and all the 
iBooks and Powerbooks that I have seen are just as good. The ones that 
you looked at may not have been calibrated correctly. You  could go in 
and play around a bit in the system settings for the screen and see if 
it improves :-) Depending on lighting where you are looking at them 
they might look poorer than they should.

I also posted the following on several of the ibook forums..... Apple 
last year made over 900,000 portables split roughly 1/2 iBook 1/2 
PowerBook. There is supposedly a class action against Apple over the 
faulty logic boards (fault was actually with the company the made them, 
not Apple and they were using poorer materials then they should have) 
but as far as I know this has been resolved and Apple has a program 
where they will replace the logic board at their cost or if you had to 
pay to get it fixed they will return your money. In any case they only 
has around 1500 signatures on this class action, figure it out as a 
percentage and you will see that it is still very low. Heck I would 
like to make anything where the failure rate is less than 1%!

I don't think any company with lcd screens will warrant them for long 
periods of time. Lcd's over time develop faults including dead pixels 
or discolored spots. On my Toshiba the screen was replace 3 times due 
to faults and even the last one developed a line all the way across the 
screen at about mid point but is faint enough that they will not 
replace it. There is also a area about the size of a thumb print that 
is also lighter then it should be but again as there is only one tough 
luck. It also has several dead or stuck pixels. Point is that if you 
check any of the companies that sell portables they all have problems.
