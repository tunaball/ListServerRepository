The facts listed are a subset of all of the conditions which might 
affect our surfing.

Here's a quote from today's MacFixit:

Safari Successes On the good side, we've received a good number of 
messages from readers who've found that sites that didn't work with 
earlier versions of Safari now work with Safari 1.2.

Earlier versions of Safari did not play well with some sites. My bank, 
for instance, would cause Safari to rev up to 90% and stay there as 
long as I surfed there. The cpu would begin overheating and the fan 
would come on with a horrible whine. This has stopped with the latest 
rev of Safari and the Java update. I suspect there was a bug in the 
older Java that was causing the web page source to continue looping 
through some part of the code. But I don't know for sure and I don't 
care. I just wanted this fixed and it seems to have been.

I would disagree about the ultimate factor. While the site itself may 
be down, overloaded, etc. it can be written with code that our software 
doesn't handle well, Microsoft is at the center of this, and our 
software can be just plain buggy and not work well.

There is no real ultimate factor, just things to fix. The trail to a 
successful site surfing consists of many steps, each of which can fail. 
Sometimes it is as easy as deleting a preference file and other times 
it can be a component failure in our hardware and so on.
