Huh? When the motherboard has been replaced by Apple it is practically a new
computer. There is no reason to believe that a computer that has been
repaired is less desirable than a computer that has not been repaired. In
point of fact, it could easily be argued it is more desirable.

My old iBook is included in Apple's warranty extension plan. It gave me no
trouble at all and I saw the current owner last weekend and she is having no
problems. So was I a lucky user or is that iBook's logic board just sitting
there ready to go capow when AppleCare runs out? I don't know and couldn't
know without taking it apart and even that might tell me nothing.

Meanwhile we have a guy whose iBook will soon be returning repaired. We know
his logic board will be good as new and since Apple has acknowledged the
problem we can be fairly certain the problem is now understood and isn't
likely to reoccur. So which computer has more value? Which computer is the
safer purchase?
