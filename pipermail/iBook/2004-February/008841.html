Jack - Maybe I remember intending to post a reply about this and never got
around to it. I think this bug has existed on and off since OS X was first
delivered. I don't recall it ever affecting OS 9 but maybe I was just lucky.
I've gone through 5 different machines (my own and at work) so perhaps it
affects certain computers but not others. But I know it happened with Jag
but at some point I went for a long stretch without hit by it. Perhaps it
was just dumb luck. At any rate, it isn't just mice. It is any USB device. I
could reliably crash my iBook (Jag) by inserting a zip disk in the drive if
the computer was asleep.
