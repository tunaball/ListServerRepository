Subject: Re: [P1] Verizon DSL with Linksys Wireless Router


This &quot; no Mac support &quot; comes from Linksys. I don't know what they 
think the problem is though. I am using one right now in a mixed 
environment and it works fine. I recall that it came with some PC only 
software but I don't remember what it did. I set up the PC first so I 
can't tell you about a Mac only setup. I do remember that when I 
installed the airport card in the mac all I had to do was run the 
Airport Setup program that is in the utilities folder and I was 
connected. On the PC end I had to install 2 pieces of software and 
reboot the laptop 4 times. ( 2 times to add the pc card and it's driver 
and 2 times to install the wireless software, all as per the 
instructions. ) Maybe they don't offer Mac support because they are too 
busy with all the support PC's require. I bought the Linksys from a Mac 
dealer no less.
--------

I have a few Linksys WAP11 units in service; the first generation boxes
required a Windows-only software package to configure (it connected to
the WAP11 through a USB connection). Their more recent stuff configures
through a web connection and I've had no problems setting that up using
OS X and Safari or Internet Explorer.

Corporate lazyness, that's all it is. A bit like my windows bigot boss;
&quot;you can have any computer you want, as long as it is a Windows system,
I don't want to support macs&quot;. It is specially ironic with Linksys,
considering their embedded OS is probably some sort of Linux kernel (or
the equivalent). Mind you, when you compare how easy it is to setup an
Airport Base Station and update their user access list for security, no
wonder that cheap Linksys stuff does not want to advertise mac
compatibility or support; it's probably too much of an embarassment, in
view of the competition. At least, with Apple's product, there is
administration software for the Mac AND the PC.
