<PRE>I've been reading this topic with some interest as I've deliberately left 
my own wifi access point open (albeit with DHCP turned off), plus I've 
used unknown open access points for mail checks and some brief web 
browsing.

I've read the analogies proposed so far. Reading the back of a fellow bus 
traveler's newspaper or listening to another's radio on the beach don't 
quite describe it as the vicarious reader/listener doesn't enter the 
newspaper/radio owner's property, and takes absolutely nothing from them. 
However, I really don't think the idea of borrowing someone's car for a 
moment when they're not using it is quite appropriate either, since 
depriving someone of their car (even for a moment) is a significant 
diminishment of their property.

I think it's unambiguously morally wrong to use others' wifi access 
points without express permission, it's the equivalent to trespassing on 
private 'property' (their LAN) and stealing (using their LAN equipment 
and operating electricity, and their internet connection.)

Would any of us just walk through a stranger's open house doors, turn on 
their lights, have a drink of their water and eat a couple potato chips 
from an open bag, without their express permission? I suspect not. Taking 
or using those things doesn't materially diminish the house owner's 
'property' in any significant (or indeed measurable) way, but it's still 
trespassing and theft.

Just because doors are left wide open doesn't mean we're invited in. Some 
open doors may actually be that invitation, others not, but morally we 
are obligated to ask before stepping inside. If we cannot discern a house 
owner's negligence from an invitation to enter, shouldn't we ask before 
entering? If there is noone to ask, or we get no answer to the request, 
then does that mean we're morally excused to just walk in?

Having said all that however, I don't mind being morally wrong by taking 
so very little from whoever kind (or clueless) person who left their wifi 
doors wide open. They'll almost certainly never notice as it takes 
nothing of any significance. If they and theirs aren't diminished I'm 
comfortable taking this tiny thing (use of their LAN and inet 
connection), with the certain knowledge I haven't adversely affected them 
in any way.

Did I legally and/or morally 'trespass' and 'steal'? You bet. Did I hurt 
the victim? I seriously doubt it. If I thought I was causing any harm I 
wouldn't do the deed. I've made my decision based on what (if any) harm 
I'd cause, not the legalities/moralities about stumbling through other's 
property as I shuffle along.

Do I feel bad knowing I'm a trespasser and thief? I reckon I should, but 
really I don't. There's so much life about which to feel bad (and good) I 
lose no sleep over this tiny transgression.

hth,

Dan K (somewhat morally corrupt, knows and doesn't really care,
          so long as no one gets hurt)
