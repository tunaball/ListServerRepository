This doesn't seem off topic for the group.

Well, WPA was introduced to address shortcomings in WEP
over the short term.  Basically if you spend enough time
watching a WEP network you can determine the key and then
join the network.  So, what I *can* tell you is that they're
either lying or don't understand the issue (which is
always a possibility when talking to tech support...).

Having said that, it's an issue of risk.  There are probably
a lot of open wireless connections near your house, and
there's little benefit to hacking into your encrypted
one.  This is the familiar principle that you don't have
to live in a bank vault to deter burglars, and you only
have to run faster than your slowest friend when being
chased by a bear....

If they support 128 bit WEP you could use that, but I
believe it isn't that much harder to crack.  Again, if
it makes you a little faster than the other guy....
