<PRE>I've some experience with a very similar setup.  That router is
quite stable and reasonable, plays nicely with AirPort bs, etc.
Sounds like you're not aaware that your DSL is (likely) PPPoE,
and the PPPoE has to be the WAN setting (on 1st of the BEFSR41
admin screens, as I recall).  Reset that, then see how things are.
And don't worry about fooling around with your settings, just
printout the current settings from your web browser interface
views before you fool around.  You can always reset to factory
defaults and start over, if you totally lose access to admin the
router--after you do that a few times :-) , re-setting the router
the way you want it is quick.  As far as reacquiring the lease,
I believe there's a setting to enable that but don't have a
router here now.  This kind of question is one the DSL tech
support shold be able to answer, in any case.  They can't expect
their large customer base to have to reset their equipment every
few days.
