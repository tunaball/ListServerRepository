</I>You probably don't have much to worry about but if you want to be on 
the safe side simply change the network name and password and stop the 
the router from broadcasting the SSID. It is all straight forward and 
simple to do. Setting WEP would also help but it is not the easiest 
thing to do on a mac and pc network. You can go here to find out more 
about security and your Lynksis router.

&gt;<i> Sometimes when I open the lid to my ibook, to look something up on my 
</I>&gt;<i> calendar, for example, it connects to somebody's wireless network and 
</I>&gt;<i> downloads my email immediately. I'm not &quot;doing&quot; anything to connect - 
</I>&gt;<i> I just happen to have my email program open and it does it before I 
</I>&gt;<i> even realize it. This happened to me at my dentist's office before and 
</I>&gt;<i> it happened to me today when I was just in a parking lot waiting for 
</I>&gt;<i> my daughter to get finished with a dance class. All of a sudden I 
</I>&gt;<i> realized that I had new mail. Seems like people have to take some 
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility for preventing this - or are we legally obligated to 
</I>&gt;<i> always have our airport cards turned off? I tend to turn it off when 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm out, because I heard here that the battery will last longer if it 
</I>&gt;<i> is off, but even so it doesn't seem that I should be considered to be 
</I>&gt;<i> doing something illegal just because I don't get it turned off 
</I>&gt;<i> instantaneously when I open the computer - seems like the people with 
</I>&gt;<i> the network could probably more easily prevent me from unintentionally 
</I>&gt;<i> accessing their network, couldn't they?
</I>

If you want to prevent your computer from connecting to networks other 
than yours, go to System Preferences, click on the Network tab, click 
the AirPort tab, click Join a specific network, enter your network 
name, then hit the Apply Now button and your set. Now your laptop will 
only connect to your network.
