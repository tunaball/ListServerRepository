You'll get as much of a speed bump - even more, perhaps - by upgrading to
Panther as you would by adding RAM. I've got an old 400 MHz iMac, which,
with only 384 MB, runs very fast under Panther. Much faster than it did
under Jag.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point, budgeting for hardware is starting for the next
</I>&gt;<i> fiscal year (which starts in July). I don't think I'm on the list
</I>&gt;<i> for a new machine (though that could change), and honestly, as
</I>&gt;<i> long as my usage doesn't change my book will remain reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> usable for the next year. If I keep this book for another year,
</I>&gt;<i> though, I'm trying to make the argument that maxing out the RAM
</I>&gt;<i> to 640MB would make a noticeable difference. It's also much
</I>&gt;<i> cheaper than a new machine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And after all of this exposition, finally, here is my dilemma:
</I>&gt;<i> the director of our data unit (who is in charge of hardware
</I>&gt;<i> buying and upgrades) is telling me that, for the applications I
</I>&gt;<i> use, an increase from 384 to 640MB will make minimal difference,
</I>&gt;<i> that I wouldn't really notice an increase in performance, due
</I>&gt;<i> mainly to the limitations of the processor. This runs counter to
</I>&gt;<i> everything I've heard (basically, that increasing RAM will always
</I>&gt;<i> help), but he's also much more of an expert than I am, so I'm
</I>&gt;<i> wondering if he's right. Can anyone shed any light on this for
</I>&gt;<i> me? Any websites out there, benchmarking, etc. you could direct
</I>&gt;<i> me to?
</I>
More RAM always helps. But if you're not planning to keep it too long, the
upgrade (which entails trashing the 256 card and buying a 512) won't be
really worth the cost. I'd vote for Panther.
