Pam,

I see your point, but your analogy is imperfect (as were mine). I'm not 
sure that there is a perfect one to use. Glancing at, and reading the 
visible portions of a newspaper being read by someone else is not quite 
the same as using someone's wireless network. By reading that paper 
from across the bus, you can't interfere with that person's reading (or 
with anything else they may choose to do with their newspaper, 
including putting it on the floor to absorb water). There is at least 
the possibility that even checking email on someone's network could 
impact them. What if they are uploading large files, or doing something 
else that may take up all or nearly all their bandwidth? Some people 
have limited bandwidth to begin with.

And, you can easily &quot;not read&quot; someone's wireless network. One click 
will do it. It's easier than not reading the newspaper across from you. 
It's really not that hard to avert our eyes from something we choose 
not to see. Personally (and I know I'm very unusual here) if someone 
has the sports page facing me, I don't have the slightest inclination 
to read it. It's of no more interest to me than a blank page.

Regards,

Harry Corsover
