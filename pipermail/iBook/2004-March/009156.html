<PRE>    Many, many thanks for your replies and help.

    I went to the Linksys site, downloaded a document entitled &gt;Setting Up
Earthlink PPPoE With A Router&quot; and followed just the first half.

    Shut everything down, unplugged all the ethernet cables to everything.

    Did a Hard Reset (factory defaults) to the Router.

    Restarted and I was able to access the router settings via Safari.
===============
&gt;<i> As to the other problem you might try upgrading the
</I>&gt;<i> firmware. This is where the no Mac support comes into
</I>&gt;<i> play. The firmware upgrade are all PC based. There
</I>&gt;<i> where some Mac hacks that are not supported by
</I>&gt;<i> Linksys, I don't know if there is an OS X version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you do upgrade the firmware it might be easiest to
</I>&gt;<i> borrow a PC laptop and use that. Thats what I did.
</I>
    Gasp! You trafficked with a PC?  Great idea.  I have a Mac pal whose
wife uses a PC laptop who himself also has a Linksys router.  I'll pass this
along to him.
==============

&gt;<i> You should also be able to setup the router for PPPoE and let it get
</I>&gt;<i> the IP address automagically (DHCP), not where you type it in.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> when Earthlink &quot;renews&quot; the address, your router will handle that for
</I>&gt;<i> you and you should not have to get into the config settings.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> have to type in the IP address, then you do not have an address that
</I>&gt;<i> gets &quot;renewed&quot; every few days.
</I>
    This is _precisely_ what I want to do, Scott.

    Are those entries made in the Status page of settings?

    Would you mind if I sent you a screen shot of my choices on that page?
===============

&gt;<i> I've some experience with a very similar setup.  That router is
</I>&gt;<i> quite stable and reasonable, plays nicely with AirPort bs, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like you're not aware that your DSL is (likely) PPPoE,
</I>&gt;<i> and the PPPoE has to be the WAN setting (on 1st of the BEFSR41
</I>&gt;<i> admin screens, as I recall).  Reset that, then see how things are.
</I>&gt;<i> And don't worry about fooling around with your settings, just
</I>&gt;<i> printout the current settings from your web browser interface
</I>&gt;<i> views before you fool around.  You can always reset to factory
</I>&gt;<i> defaults and start over, if you totally lose access to admin the
</I>&gt;<i> router--after you do that a few times :-) , re-setting the router
</I>&gt;<i> the way you want it is quick.  As far as reacquiring the lease,
</I>&gt;<i> I believe there's a setting to enable that but don't have a
</I>&gt;<i> router here now.  This kind of question is one the DSL tech
</I>&gt;<i> support should be able to answer, in any case.  They can't expect
</I>&gt;<i> their large customer base to have to reset their equipment every
</I>&gt;<i> few days. 
</I>
    Agree most strongly with your last sentence, Tom, and that's what I was
trying to achieve:  not having to reset my equipment every few days.

    When you say &quot;PPPoE has to be the WAN setting&quot;. I looked at both the
Setup and Admin pages but could find no WAN setting, however.

    Thanks, once more,
    bob
