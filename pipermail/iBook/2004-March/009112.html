First, the disclaimer: I work for Verizon Wireless.

In theory, all of the cell phones we sell have the same signal strength. In
practice, different phones seem to work for different people. I can't always
explain why. Although we sell phones by several different companies, the
CDMA chips are frequently made by the same company (Qualcomm). The addendum
to my above advice would be to find a provider that gives a reasonable trial
period. For example, we give 15 days. Also, check out what ever the Canadian
or Scottish equivalent of Consumer Reports (if such a thing exists).

Sometimes reviews on sites like CNET are useful, sometimes they're just
people venting (&quot;company didn't honor my warranty after I got the phone wet&quot;
sort of thing).
