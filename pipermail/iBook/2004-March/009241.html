Hi list !

Even after a few weeks, let me sum a previous issue discussed on the  
list. I am on the verge of buying an audio in for my iBook G4, so I  
gathered this info.

First, here's Apple compatibility list for Garageband. I'm aware this  
list should expand greatly, but I'm not sure I would buy an audio  
device not to be supported (by Garageband or LogicAudio).
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/compatibility.html">http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/compatibility.html</A>

Second, here's a &quot;buyer's guide&quot;.
<A HREF="http://www.macjams.com/article.php?story=20040128080648368">http://www.macjams.com/article.php?story=20040128080648368</A>

Third, here's snippets of what have been said on the list.

Gene and Al indicated their likeliness for:
&#171;Griffin's iMic and Powerwave:
<A HREF="http://www.griffintechnology.com/index.html">http://www.griffintechnology.com/index.html</A> &#187;

Christian told us about:
&#171;How about 1/4&quot; balanced, line, XLR...? I have the M-Audio MobilePRE,  
and that does the trick... Four to five times the price of the iMic,  
though...
<A HREF="http://www.m-audio.com/index.php?">http://www.m-audio.com/index.php?</A> 
do=products.main&amp;ID=8eb1a9920df341303f81bca7ff458be3 . I use mine for  
voice recording from a balanced XLR microphone; it has built-in phantom  
power, and truly rocks, portability wise. Works great with OS X. They  
also have other interesting USB devices that might do the trick, if you  
don't need the XLR support... &#187;

The pricing was discussed by Gene:
&#171;Christian...offhand, do you happen to know the diff between the item  
you recommended and Griffin's Powerwave  
(<A HREF="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/powerwave/index.html">http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/powerwave/index.html</A>)? I  
know there's a big price diff $99.99 vs $179.95.&#187;

Then Christian answered a long discussion:
&#171;The Griffin Powerwave  has regular stereo RCA-type line outs and  
stereo mini plug connectors. Generally, this setup will work OK for  
consumer applications where you don't mind having some possible noise  
in the recording: it's unbalanced audio, so the longer the cord between  
the Powerwave &amp; the audio source - be it a tape deck, sound system aux  
in/out, or inexpensive mike, the bigger the chance to pick up static or  
RF interference. And you can't take sound in from pro sound equipment,  
using either shielded 1/4 plugs or XLR connectors (unless you buy  
adaptors which, again, are subject to interference and noise).
The MobilePRE has hardware volume controls for gain, balanced audio  
support and you can use studio microphones - either with out without  
phantom power - on it. In my case, I've used it to record sound  
sessions from live video tapings, by plugging myself in to the audio  
out of mixing consoles or auditorium sound systems. I've also used the  
XLR connectivity to feed great audio out from the mac to auditoriums.
If you're going to be mostly spending your time transfering old hissy  
records or tapes to CD, then by all means you can get the Griffin  
Powerwave; also, if you want a small audio amplifier for Apple Pro  
Speakers, the Powerwave is really cool. If, however, you want to do  
pristine, crystal clear voice recording - or musical instruments -  and  
you want to do some killer voice input to use with Garage Band, Digital  
Performer, Peak or any other app and use a good XLR microphone, then  
you might want to consider the M-Audio unit instead.
The MobilePRE is probably one of the cheapest pro-level USB audio  
interfaces I've seen. That, a good pair of headphones, an inexpensive  
Shure XLR mike and an inexpensive mixer, and you've pretty much got the  
basis for your own little audio-studio playground, Fun stuff.&#187;

Me now.
Ok. I want XLR. MobilePre USB is in Apple's list of supported hardware.  
It is not cheap (180$US). Does anyone has anything to say (additionnal  
advice) before I purchase one ?! :-)
But what about the Behringer UB502 Eurorack? It's only 40$US and have  
XLR. Sounds a good alternative, but it not (yet) in Apple's  
compatibility list. Anyone tried it?

Thanks,

Alex
