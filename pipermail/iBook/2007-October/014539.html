<PRE>Hi Wilfred,

I was away from my computer this afternoon. But here is why you don't
find Ubuntu for the PowerPC on their official download site.

I would suggest that if you want to go Linux that you use an official
and supported version, no matter which one you choose. These versions
can be much quicker in responding to system issues as they come up.

The PowerPC Architecture
------------------------

Summary:

  Beginning with Ubuntu 7.04, the PowerPC edition of Ubuntu will be
  reclassified as unofficial.  The PowerPC software itself and supporting
  infrastructure will continue to be available, and supported by a community
  team.

Full decision:

  The Ubuntu Technical Board has decided to reclassify PowerPC as an
  unofficial architecture, rather than a fully supported architecture, for
  Ubuntu 7.04 and subsequent releases. This means that packages and ISO
  images will continue to be produced, but releases will not be delayed due
  to problems which are specific to PowerPC, and the quality of the PowerPC
  release itself will depend very much on the extent to which members of the
  Ubuntu community drive PowerPC testing and bug fixes.

  The rationale for this decision has been recorded in the PowerPC Review
  document at <A HREF="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCReview,">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCReview,</A> which was derived from
  a discussion at our developer summit in November. The conversation has
  continued, and for some time we have pursued a number of sources for
  funding to continue the official testing and support for the architecture.
  Unfortunately those resources have not been obtained, and we can not make
  the necessary commitments to continue official support for this
  architecture.

  A team of PowerPC users and developers has been formed at
  <A HREF="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-powerpc">https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-powerpc</A> and will be the focus of efforts to
  keep Ubuntu's PowerPC support at high quality. We welcome wider
  participation in that team, and if developers devote some additional time
  to the work then there is no reason that Ubuntu on PowerPC should not
  continue to deliver high quality releases.

  It is possible that PowerPC will once again become a fully supported
  architecture in the future, if the resources needed to guarantee its
  quality are found. The architecture is certainly gaining large numbers of
  users in embedded and console devices, and there are many reasons to
  continue to work with the platform. These uses are outside of the core
  Ubuntu mandate, however, so resources cannot be diverted from our server
  and desktop efforts just to address their needs.

  Existing Ubuntu PowerPC releases will continue to be maintained for the
  duration of their supported life cycles, including Ubuntu 6.06 LTS which
  will be supported on PowerPC servers until 2011.
