<PRE>Have you tried booting from an install CD? If the screen stays lit  
this would point to a problem with your operating system. If it does  
stay lit, try running the disk utility and repair permissions just to  
create some activity and see if it will continue to stay lit. However  
if it still goes out, this would indicate a hardware problem.

You might also try hooking up an external monitor to see if the iBook  
delivers a proper video signal. If you have a picture and the iBook  
runs normally without freezing, then the logic board is probably OK.  
In that case I would suspect the inverter board or the lamp in the  
LCD screen is faulty.

One more thing to try. Start up the iBook with the shift key down.  
This will cause it to boot into Safe Boot. It forces the System to  
examine the directory and do minor repair to it. It also prevents  
third party apps and system extensions from loading. Once again, if  
the screen stays lit, this points to a problem with the OS.

Good luck.
