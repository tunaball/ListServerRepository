<PRE>I'm getting ready to put this up on eBay, but I thought I'd offer it to 
list members first:

People who have been with the list over the past several years may 
remember that I've always said I'd never part with my beloved Key Lime 
iBook -- but, alas, that time has come. (I still prefer the design of 
the clamshell iBooks, but the new model iBook I'm using makes some 
strong arguments.)

The good news is that it's being repaired, and having a number of the 
key components that show the most wear after five years' use replaced, 
so it's probably the closest thing to a &quot;new&quot; Key Lime iBook you're 
likely to find.

Key Lime iBook G3/466 CD/DVD
USB, Firewire, A/V Ports
768 MB RAM
Original AirPort Card
Mac OS 10.3.X (will include original discs)
Includes, packaging, discs, manuals, and all the cables I can find. 
(A/V cable is definitely included -- I'm not sure if I still have the 
phone cord.) The &quot;yoyo&quot; AC Adapter is relatively new, and was purchased 
about a year and a half ago as a replacement for the original.

Features:
Newly Refurbished Replacement LCD screen (with MacResQ 90-day warranty)
Newly Refurbished Power Connector Board (with MacResQ 90-day warranty)
Newly Refurbished Keyboard (with MacResQ 90-day warranty)

New 100GB Hard Drive (with manufacturer warranty)

Relatively new (less than six months old) Newer Technology Extra 
Capacity Battery (see 
&lt;<A HREF="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Newer%20Technology/BAPIB148V44/">http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Newer%20Technology/BAPIB148V44/</A>&gt; for 
details). It's been giving me about 4.5 hours under 10.3, with AirPort 
on.

Also includes:
VST Clamshell iBook Battery Charger (I've used this to resuscitate 
older clamshell batteries; I bought it to get the replacement AC 
Adapter.)
Original AirPort Graphite Base station (with original packaging, discs, 
manuals, and cables). This is a refurbished model, provided by Apple to 
replace a unit that failed due to an acknowledged problem.

Overall, it's always been treated with care, so it's in very good 
condition, nice and clean. (Photos can be provided.) I'm asking $800 
for the lot -- which I think is a bargain, given all the newly replaced 
components and new hard drive). Please reply off-list if interested.
