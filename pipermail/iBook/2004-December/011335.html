<PRE> Dear Patrick; 

Anytime you have a Macintosh computer technical support can be hit or miss,
depending on the technician.  I have BellSouth DSL, and have had a wonderful
experience with the 2Wire support group.  When you have BellSouth DSL, they
farmout the technical support to the maker of your modem.  As I said, our
experience with 2Wire  has been exceptional, but I know other people with
other setups that have not have as much success.  If it is possible, having
a three-way conversation could be helpful for you to be an intermediary
since your father is new to this (unless he is really savvy in general with
Electronics, despite not having a computer background).  If your father is
an explorer and a visual person, though, he should have no problems.  I have
friends who are on Charter that have had problems with Macs, but I think of
as much of it was the specific technician they got (a problem anywhere)
rather than the company as a whole.

Be sure that your dad is comfortable navigating around with the menus before
he calls for technical support, or he will be overwhelmed, just because
everything is so new.

I hope he loves his iBook wireless as much as I do!

Valerie

Voice recognition in use; I talk, iListen types, I correct. Neither of us is
perfect.  :-)
