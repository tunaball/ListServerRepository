I'm assuming the Powerbook is a 12&quot;, so the screen size and resolution 
are the same.  The processor speed is close enough that it's not really 
a factor either.  Since the Powerbook is the more expensive, I'd define 
what advantages the Powerbook may have and decide if I need those 
capabilities.

The Powerbook has twice the hard drive space, can burn DVDs, and can 
drive another monitor independently without hacking the firmware.  Do 
you need any of those capabilities?  On the minus side, the iBook's 
plastic case is arguably better suited for mobile use and may also 
allow more range in wireless mode.  The iBook is also new, with the 
accompanying warranty coverage in case something goes wrong.

Personally, I'd go with the Powerbook.  The Superdrive isn't a big deal 
to me, but more hard drive space is always good and the dual-head 
capability would be very cool.  They've proven quite reliable as well.  
If your friend bought the extended warranty and it's still in effect, 
that could also be another advantage for the Powerbook.
