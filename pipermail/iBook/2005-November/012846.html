<PRE>I might add an addendum to this..   IF your iBooks have run out of 
warranty and you can't strong-arm Apple into helping, don't despair.. 
Email me-there is a way to get them repaired short of a full logic 
board replacement.

&gt;<i>We have seen a pretty high number of the 12 &amp; 12&quot; G4 iBooks show the 
</I>&gt;<i>same (or similiar) issues with video, as did the early G3 iBooks. 
</I>&gt;<i>Unfortunately, Apple has successfully held off a class-action suit 
</I>&gt;<i>against the G4's, so this has gone without any warranty coverage to 
</I>&gt;<i>date.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The symptoms are usually either video issues color streaks,bars, 
</I>&gt;<i>random lockups when the colors show up, and a few which are not 
</I>&gt;<i>showing video at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The only answer I would have for this would be to make sure the 
</I>&gt;<i>laptops are not being used in a way which torques/warps the lower 
</I>&gt;<i>case.  Teachers (and students) often use the laptop on uneven 
</I>&gt;<i>surfaces, causing the case (and logic board) to warp.  This 
</I>&gt;<i>pressures the video chip and the processor, and they develop 
</I>&gt;<i>hairline cracks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>hope this helps...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Greetings iBook listers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>A teaching colleague has just come around with her G4 14&quot;iBook. She 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>was working on her school reports when her screen developed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>problems. It suddenly cut out to 1 second screens of red, green, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>blue, etc. When she bought it around, it fired up okay so thought I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>would repair permissions and do an Open Firmware reset, not really 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>believing they were the problem. But then the colours struck (I've 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>never seen this before - nvram fault/ logic board?). After leaving 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it with the battery out for 30 mins, I tried an Open Firmware 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>restart, then tried plugging in an external monitor (just stays 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>black) and also tried Target mode (doesn't show up on other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>machine).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>One thing I did notice was that it has no start up chime.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I left it for a couple of hours and tried it again. When I opened 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it up (I think it may have been left going but hard to tell) the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>fan started and ran for an abnormally long time. Then I tried to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>start it in Open Firmware but although I was holding down the kyds, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it started normally. Unfortunately, I didn't have the user's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>password and so I had to ring her. I got this off her and started 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to drag stuff off onto an external drive. I had just got the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>precious reports off and was trying to grab all her other documents 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>when it went into the coloured screens again - red, blue, green, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>grey, black, cycling through endlessly. I have now shut it again in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the hope I can get a little more off it. It seems to go for 3 mins 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>before going into this cycle. I'll try timing it next time. Any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>thoughts on the problem and solution?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>This particular school has had an incredible run of problems with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>their iBooks. This teacher is on her second after endless problems 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>with her first and it is only 16 weeks old. Another teacher had 4 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>logicboard repairs until they replaced hers and the Principals was 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>also replaced. I wonder about some bad practice in their use of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>their laptops. I understand that there is a design fault in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>hinging of the screen putting pressure onto the logicboard. I have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>always encouraged kids to either have the screen fully open or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>shut, not 'play' with the catch opening and closing the lid as they 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>are prone to do. Any thoughts as to why they have been so beset 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>with problems and possible solutions. This is only a 8 teacher 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>rural school and the young teacher in charge of computing is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>tearing her hair out coping with the number of computers she has to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>take in for repairs. These are all 12&quot; / 14&quot; iBooks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Cheers
