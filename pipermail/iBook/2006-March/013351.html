<PRE>I forgot to mention, my HP all-in-one's are the G85xi and the 1210PSC. The
1210PSC (now upgraded to better model numbers) is small and easy to use
anywhere in the house. The G85 is like a small copy machine and heavy. 
 
However, the G85 (now sold as the G95 I think??) can also be a standalone
fax machine (and receive faxes on its own) and when you use it as a copier
you can enlarge/reduce the size of the copies just using the buttons on the
machine, which is incredibly useful if you are doing any type of business
work or school work from home. The G85 will also fax or copy a stack of
papers rather than having to lay them on the glass one by one.

The HP all-in-one's work well if you have a direct USB connection, but they
network horribly with Macs if you try to put them on wireless or a print
server. For a direct USB connection, there are no problems. 
 
The HP Director is software that loads at startup and always resident in the
background so you can bring it forward at any time to do a fax/copy/scan. 
 
I prefer to separately load scanning software when I need it, not to have it
always running.

&gt;<i> I really appreciate all the feedback. I'm all ears, and I'd really 
</I>&gt;<i> like to make sure she gets 'the right one' for her Mac. It will not 
</I>&gt;<i> be networked, nor will it need to be used by a Windows machine. That 
</I>&gt;<i> HP director thing sounds a bit flakey though...
