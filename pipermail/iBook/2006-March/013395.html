<PRE>That last sentence in their statement indicates to me that any iBooks  
brought in after the program would be dealt with on a case-by-case  
basis, so you certainly have nothing to lose by bring it in to the  
Genius Bar.

Good call on the cable-to-the-screen idea, but I don't think it's the  
case here, as I'm pretty sure the AV port signal would come through a  
different cable, and you said the external monitor doesn't work  
either.  Have you tried booting into Open Firmware?  The OS would  
rely on loading a video card driver, but Open Firmware would be the  
ROM communicating directly with the video at the most basic level.   
If you get nothing there, I'd say she's cakked.

</I>&gt;<i> I did try resetting the PMU by following the directions on Apple's

</I>&gt;<i> Also, for a while I was able to get to the machine via Chicken of the

</I>&gt;<i> reset I tried to get back into it via CotVNC and the video was
</I>&gt;<i> scrambled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After that point I dug out the dongle and tried to hook it up to an
</I>&gt;<i> external vga monitor and got nothing on the screen at all. The monitor
</I>&gt;<i> is known good. Did I do that correctly? I plugged the dongle into the
</I>&gt;<i> machine and plugged the monitor into the dongle and then booted the
</I>&gt;<i> machine. I once again got a black screen on both the monitor and the
</I>&gt;<i> iBook screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The serial number on the iBook falls within the range of the iBooks
</I>&gt;<i> that were eligible for the logic board repair program, but the website
</I>&gt;<i> says that it ended on March 18 a year ago. (2005)
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/ibook/faq/">http://www.apple.com/support/ibook/faq/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like the cheapest I could find a logic board from for it from a
</I>&gt;<i> parts dealer is about $240 plus shipping. I certainly wouldn't want to
</I>&gt;<i> buy something like this via ebay or the swaplist considering the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that these logic boards were invlolved in a recall. The iBook itself
</I>&gt;<i> isn't worth much more than $240 anyhow (if it were in working order
</I>&gt;<i> that is) so I guess this is a loss. She has had this thing for a
</I>&gt;<i> little less than 5 years so I think it has lived it's useful life, I
</I>&gt;<i> have already replaced a failed hard drive in it and  the screen hinge
</I>&gt;<i> as well within the last few years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on things I have read on the web I have had the thought that
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps the cable that runs to the screen has failed, I am not sure
</I>&gt;<i> how to test that without tearing the machine down. Then I am not sure
</I>&gt;<i> I could test it without buying a new cable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are there any definitive tests I could run to determine if this is a
</I>&gt;<i> failed logic board? Does the fact that I could not get a signal to an
</I>&gt;<i> external monitor mean that this is a logic board issue and not an
</I>&gt;<i> issue with the cable going throught the hinge to the screen?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The apple website about the logic board replacement is here;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/ibook/faq/">http://www.apple.com/support/ibook/faq/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> on that website it says this;
</I>&gt;<i> ==================================================================
</I>&gt;<i> How long is the Expanded iBook Logic Board Repair Extension Program  
</I>&gt;<i> available?
</I>&gt;<i> The program covers affected iBooks for three years after the first
</I>&gt;<i> retail sale of the unit or until March 18, 2005, whichever provides
</I>&gt;<i> longer coverage for you. Apple will continue to evaluate the repair
</I>&gt;<i> data and will provide further repair extensions as needed.
</I>&gt;<i> ==================================================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think that the last sentence means they may still be replacing
</I>&gt;<i> the logic boards in these machines? Should I take  this thing to the
</I>&gt;<i> genius bar and see if they will replace the logic board? (My first
</I>&gt;<i> thought on that is that there is no way they will even think about it
</I>&gt;<i> since that program was supposed to end a year ago)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts on any of this are greatly appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks,
