Chris, to be honest, your question is a bit complicated (confusing), but I
think I get the gist.

First, the new hard drive will not be formatted (Mac or PC). After you
install it you have two choices. 1) Start up from an install CD (9 or X) and
format the drive (erase/partition) via the Disk Utility. 2) Start up in
Target Disk Mode, connect the iBook to your G4 and format it with the Disk
Utility. All done.

As for installing the drive (a very difficult process I've done many times
at my shop) I would recommend going to www.pbfixit.com and check out their
series of online repair procedures. They're very thorough. Someone else's
suggestion to print the pages and tape the screws is a good idea.

Now, if I understand you correctly, you want to clone your G4 hard drive to
retain the same OS and applications. I would suggest putting your iBook into
Target Disk Mode, connecting it to your G4, and clone the OSX volume. An
excellent utility to do this (better than CCC) is called SuperDuper. Just
run it from the G4.

Now for Classic. At this point you can boot from an OS9.2 CD and install
classic. I've found that I have to select &quot;Clean Install&quot; so the installer
will proceed. This WILL NOT remove you OSX System. One other option which
may be easier is to simply drag-and-drop the OS9 System Folder from your G4
to the iBook. If it acts funky (shouldn't) then go into System Preferences;
Classic; Advanced, and choose to rebuild the OS9 Desktop.

Hope this helps.
