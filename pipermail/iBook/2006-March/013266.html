Mark,

Thanks for you reply. I tore the iBook down on Saturday morning and 
replaced the hard drive. Saturday afternoon I tore the iBook down again 
and properly seated the ribbon cable so the HD would work :) Pulling 
the machine apart was not too scary. I had the PB fixit tear down pages 
handy and all the tools. I think the toughest part was getting the 
power switch plug back into the logic board and that pesky screw on the 
left side of the CD tray. Success is a matter of preparation, patience, 
and to some extent a lack of fear. In the past I've replaced the  
drives in a few of the old CRT iMacs, and replaced the LCD in an iBook 
for a friend. The iBook that I now have was obtained through some 
trading and the only real money I had in it was for the new HD and a 
512K stick of ram. I already had the all important Airport 11b card 
that is going for more than I got the IBook for. During tear-down I was 
pleasantly surprised by seeing the dates on the HD and the combo drive 
as July 2003.  I was under the impression that it was an G3/500 when I 
made the deal for it.  As is turns out it's a G3/900. I couldn't be 
more happy especially since the battery is at almost 4 hours.

Migrating the info from my G4 did not go as well. At first I foolishly 
wasted time copying a CCC made disk image to the new drive. It was not 
bootable. The second time I tried to back up the HD in as bootable but 
it errored out at the last minute. I decided to cut my time losses and 
install a retail copy of 10.3 that I had just to get the machine going. 
  After carefully reading the documentation for CCC and Superduper I 
will have another go at as soon as my power-supply arrives and I am off 
battery power.

Thanks!
Chris
