<PRE>
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My friend is going ahead with her plans to buy her first Mac, an
</I>&gt;<i> iBook.  She would like to buy one of those &quot;all in one&quot; printers that
</I>&gt;<i> can fax and copy as well.  Do any of you have experience with these,
</I>&gt;<i> or know of a good review site that is pertinent to Macs?
</I>

Having just gone through the process of finding an all in one printer for my
office, I can share a little of what I've discovered.

First, she needs to figure out what she will be mostly printing. And how
many pages. The inkjet models cost less initially, and can handle color, but
inkjet cartridges are very expensive to replace. If she is mostly printing
text, then go for the laser. It will save a lot of money over time. If she
needs color on occasion that just buy an additional cheap inkjet printer

While in the past I've been a loyal HP user, I recently purchased the
Brother 5 in 1 unit. I forget the model number, as it is at my office. It is
the latest one. And I've been quite happy with it. It prints fast. It is
networkable (important for me). Also has USB connection. It copies well, the
fax function seems to work fine for me. The only thing I'm not crazy about
is the scanning software. It seems a bit clunky to me. But it scans fine.

All and all, I'm very satisfied with the new all in one unit from Brother
and would recommend it. Plus it is smaller and has nicer styling than the
HP. Size was important for me, as my office is small and I wanted an unit
that would tuck nicely into a corner. This one does.

Hope that helps
Michael
