My friend is going ahead with her plans to buy her first Mac, an
iBook. She would like to buy one of those &quot;all in one&quot; printers that
can fax and copy as well. Do any of you have experience with these,
or know of a good review site that is pertinent to Macs?


Sorry to be chiming in rather late, but I'm on digest--we have a  
Canon Pixma MP800 that we really like.  There aren't too many of  
these all-in-one models (especially including a fax) for Macs.

Ours is connected to an Airport Extreme Base Station and we use it  
wirelessly for printing. The only caveat that we have with it is that  
to scan, it has to be disconnected from the AEBS and plugged directly  
into the computer. We don't see that as a big issue, since we have  
laptops and we just carry it in and make that necessary connection.  
The scanner is a nice one, alllowing you to scan several photos at  
one time (our old Canon scanner didn't do this, you had to do one at  
a time). Other functions, like copying and printing work fine and  
speedily. This unit replaced an Epson C-80 inkjet, which is still  
perfectly good; this was just one of the models available as part of  
the deal when my husband purchased his iBook.

Hth,

Mary
