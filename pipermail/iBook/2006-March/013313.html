<PRE>Apple designed the Panther install to walk you through as simple and 
basic an install as possible. If you already have OSX on the machine the 
default is an update but there is an option to erase and install. A pane 
will open early in the install and give you three options; Update, 
Archive and Install, and Erase and Install. Update will be preselected. 
Choose the last one instead. If you do this you WILL eliminate all 
traces of the previous owner. It will be just like  a new machine.  All  
settings, preferences, and data will be gone. If you have OS9 installed 
that also will be gone.

As for partitioning I don't remember exactly but I think early on before 
you start the install you make a selection from the menu bar that opens 
Disc Utility. Once that opens you can pick how many partitions you want 
and there is a nice graphic that lets you drag to select how big each 
partition is. I have a 10gb harddrive and I set up one as 1gb. That is 
big enough to do a full install of OS9 and still have plenty of room for 
a few applications and some data files. I back up my OSX document folder 
onto it once a month just for peace of mind.
Good luck,
               Mike
