<PRE>Hi Everyone,
	I am really appreciating this listserv.  I am learning so much.
	 I seem to have a mental block about absorbing this information on 
base stations, cables, hubs, ethernet,  wires going here and there, 
etc... but here goes. It's not above my comprehension, it's just way to 
much new stuff at once.
	 We are building a house - off the grid - photovoltaic power and back 
up generator power and no telephone line.  I have an ibook and my 
husband has a PC laptop.  We're interested in combining the best of 
technology from both worlds, simplicity and efficiency - meaning we 
would like to have the television, stereo and computers and printer and 
internet working together with structured wiring.  What should we 
really focus on for wiring?
	There will be no regular phone line  (so no dial up or DSL 
availability) and power will be converted from DC to AC.  A wireless 
tower is located very near us, but we are in a low point of that tower. 
  Satellite is available.  Oh, we do plan on wiring the house for both 
AC and DC incase we or someone else wants to get back on the grid, and 
we will also run phone lines incase we or someone else wants to have 
&quot;regular&quot; phone service at some point.  The house is a simple, story 
and a half structure.
	 I've read the recent Macworld article on networking and have done 
some research on structured wiring but my main focus for now is what 
combination would work best.  Maybe someone has done this already ??  
Maybe someone knows of a more direct resource to point me to (as 
opposed to running hellter skelter on the internet).  Or maybe you are 
a feng shui expert AND a mac user and clearly explain to me what cables 
and hardware I'm going to need to pull together.
	As usual, I'm most grateful for any info.
Thanks -
Linda

</PRE>
