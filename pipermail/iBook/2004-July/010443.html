Thanks for the many replies on the VST charger.

Dave, I bought my VST charger off eBay for the same reason you mention. I
have 3 dead batteries I had hoped to bring back. At one time in their life
they were in good shape. They held a good charge when the previous owner
stored them away and now, almost a year later, they refuse to charge or do
anything. I get the missing battery icon shortly after inserting them into
an iBook to charge.

I installed the Apple Battery Reset (for OS9) onto the iBook but this did
nothing. Have you installed it on yours? If not, try searching Apple's
support, keywords; iBook Battery Reset.

-Mark
