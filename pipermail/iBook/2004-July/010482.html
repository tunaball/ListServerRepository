<PRE>Mike, 

Yeah, that totally helps.  I understand, and I suspect the reason you
can &quot;seamlessly&quot; roam between base stations when they're wired/same
SSID/same channel is due to the client's network hardware, and has
nothing to do with any cooperation between base stations :)

This is no hugely big deal, I'm only living in the current place for 4
more weeks anyway.  In fact I might be able to move the cable modem
out here (living room), but last time I checked it only worked on ONE
of our three cable drops! :)

In the future I'll ditch the linksys that needs to be powercycled
every day or two to keep the wireless running, and either get a second
AE, or an AEBS.  Too bad the base stations still don't have onboard
switches, but i no longer need multiple wired devices (network printer
only), and now the AEBS has a 100mbit LAN port, i can always hook up
an external switch...

Looking forward to traveling with the AE, gonna be in Europe for 4
months... presto wireless connection anywhere I have an ethernet jack!
 Thank god for apple and their world power kits, so i won't have to
have a huge ugly block barely hanging on for dear life out of the
outlet.

&gt;<i> Hi Reid,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Brian Pearce already replied with the correct answer (as far as both he
</I>&gt;<i> and I know, anyway!), but I'm in a talkative mood today, so I thought
</I>&gt;<i> I'd expand a little:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Airport Express can only work as a repeater with other Apple branded
</I>&gt;<i> wireless products.  LinkSys, D-Link, and probably other networking
</I>&gt;<i> companies also offer wireless repeater products (although not with the
</I>&gt;<i> same options for music sharing and such that the Airport Express does),
</I>&gt;<i> and the also will work only with wireless products from the same
</I>&gt;<i> company.  As I understand it, this is because the WDS protocol that
</I>&gt;<i> Brian mentioned is not part of the 802.11 spec, so each company's
</I>&gt;<i> products implement the protocol just differently enough that they won't
</I>&gt;<i> work with products from other companies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your assessment of what Mr. Pogue was referring to in his article is
</I>&gt;<i> correct - that technique requires multiple WIRED base stations.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> have, say, an Airport base station and a Linksys base station, you
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to set up one network transparently by setting the SSID
</I>&gt;<i> and channel to the same thing on both of them, but only if they're both
</I>&gt;<i> wired to the network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you can run cable to the other room and hook up the Airport Express
</I>&gt;<i> to the network using its ethernet port, then I think you could be in
</I>&gt;<i> business.  But otherwise, I think you're out of luck.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps,
</I>&gt;<i> Mike W.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hope someone can help me with this.  I see that the Airport Express
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can work with an Airport Base Station or Airport Extreme Base Station,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without being physically wired.  So it can act like a repeater, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then be used to output your music to the local speakers, no matter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which base station you're actually closest to (and therefore using).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Correct?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now can it do the same thing with other brand base stations?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I found out recently through David Pogue's column that you can make a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multi-node network by simply setting the SSID and channel of multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; base stations to the same channel -- cool!  So it doesn't matter what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brand you use, according to him.  But I think this is only when base
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stations both have wired connections, it didn't address the issue of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acting like a repeater (or, in my mind, a bridge).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anybody know?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Looking to pick one up ASAP, but I have a Linksys BEFW11S4 router and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my speakers are in the other room.. I'd like to be able to use the AE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to play music wirelessly, but don't want to have to hop to a wireless
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; network with no internat access to play music :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hopefully my 802.11b gear is fast enough anyway...
