<PRE>&lt;snip&gt;
Dave, I bought my VST charger off eBay for the same reason you mention. I 
have 3 dead batteries I had hoped to bring back. At one time in their life 
they were in good shape. They held a good charge when the previous owner 
stored them away and now, almost a year later, they refuse to charge or do 
anything. I get the missing battery icon shortly after inserting them into 
an iBook to charge. 

I installed the Apple Battery Reset (for OS9) onto the iBook but this did 
nothing. Have you installed it on yours? If not, try searching Apple's 
support, keywords; iBook Battery Reset. 
&lt;/snip&gt;

I haven't tried the battery reset thing, but I don't think my problem is the same.  I've never had a problem with the battery not being recognized.  The battery always shows up, it's just that it only holds about 10 minutes of charge after over 3 years of use.  That's why I'm skeptical that the charger could do much good.  I think it would only help a battery that isn't worn out, but needs to be reset in some way because it's been on the shelf for too long, and discharged too far.  That's my guess anyway.
Dave.
