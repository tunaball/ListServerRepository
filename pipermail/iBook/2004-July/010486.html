<PRE>ooh, good point, didn't even think of/consider the AE as a client
thing... that would work for my purposes if it works that way.

Not sure about the linksys, probably not...

Anyway, I will have one ASAP.. 3-4 weeks shipping for orders placed
today, but the stores expect to receive them soon.. as soon as
tomorrow, and at least by next week sometime.  While they're
backordered online, i don't excpect them to have the same consumer
demand of the ipod mini.. when i ask stores about it, they don't say
anything warning me about limited supplies or lots of people asking
about em or anything ... I will call and ask every day, try to get one
reserved, and go pick it up asap since i work right near one... just a
few miles away.

will let you all know :)
