<PRE>Jack, I have just sent of a screen dump of all the replies to your  
keyboard problem to a teacher I work with who is on her second  
keyboard. She got a new iBook from our Ministry of Education not long  
ago (all teachers in NZ get a heavily subsidized laptop) and I  
noticed the keys on her keyboard were wearing out the other day. When  
I pointed it out, I was shocked to learn that this was a replacement  
for the first that had worn out, and it was happening again. This is  
just to let you know it is happening in Kiwiland too, and seems to be  
yet another quality control problem we have to put up with with the  
white iBooks. Anyone else feel the most reliable laptop they have had  
is the old Clamshells? I had a dozen indigos at a tertiary teacher  
training institution and I carted them all around the country running  
workshops with groups of distance learning students. They never  
missed a beat, despite being carted by land, sea and air into some  
pretty wild country. Just my penny's worth
