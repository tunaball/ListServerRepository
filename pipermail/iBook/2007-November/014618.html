I think there was some discussion a long time back that it was  
preferable to use 5400 rpm drives as there is an issue with heat if  
using 7200 rpm drives but please don't quote me.
You have some amazing parts outlets / online supplies that offer parts  
quite cheaply, and especially one off specials for a few days - wish  
we could get Mac stuff like that here - places like OWC at <A HREF="http://www.macsales.com/">http://www.macsales.com/</A>

</I>There is an excellent iBook take apart here (presuming it is the white  
rectangular model, not a clamshell?;

In terms of the sort of jobs non- technical people may want to do on  
their computer / laptop, I would rate this as an 8 out of 10. It is  
all about confidence. Be confident you can do it!

I have pulled apart a number of 12 and 14&quot; laptops and in fact have  
just picked one up tonight very cheaply for my daughter at Uni. It is  
a 14&quot; late model G4 that has the little copper end of the power supply  
stuck inside the Power socket in the computer. The teacher at a school  
tripped over the power cord! It can't be got out in any way that I  
know of, so it has to be replaced. The DC in board (the power socket  
part) is a cheap part but the machine has to come apart to replace it.

Anyway, I digress;

My advice would be;

- be methodical

- give yourself plenty of time - allow 2 -3 hours on a kitchen table  
with no distractions

- don't be scared to take some time out when the going gets tough -  
have some coffee handy - there are some stages where you will have to  
stop and take a big breath but you get there

- Work through the pages of the Fixit guide - have a good look at what  
you need to do first! If you click on illustrations, they give you a  
bigger version of just the illustration. I print these out, and as I  
take all the screws out - and there are often 3 or 4 sizes to remove  
for one section, I stick them with cellotape in the exact location on  
the printed picture of the section I am disassembling. Then, when you  
put it back together you know exactly which screw goes where - you  
pluck it off the diagram and put it in its place in the laptop - no  
mistakes, no screws left over. (I wish there was something similar for  
when I replaced the gearbox in my wife's Mazda Familia recently - I  
had a very large bolt left over which has always worried me! - She was  
just surprised it went Forward when she put it in gear!)

- there are two bad stages in this medical drama

1)- splitting the case = page 7/18. Don't be scared, I know it will  
seem like you are putting too much force into it, but it will give.  
Once you have done one, you don't think about it and they just pop  
apart no problems. Its just we have never done this before and get  
worried we will break something.

They talk about using a spudger to prise it open- not sure what this  
is but I have used plastic ice cream sticks, one of my wife's large  
size knitting needles with flats ground on the end so that it was like  
a large plastic screw driver - don't tell her I stole one!  You'll  
find something you can use. It needs to be plastic, thin bladed,  
strong, but slightly flexible

2) - removing the connector for the mic and speakers, etc (page 12/18)  
There is a tiny connector with from memory six fine wires going into  
it. There is a red warning on this stage. Be very careful here - use a  
long thin nosed pair of pliers very carefully. I broke a wire on the  
first one I did - luckily it was a dead one I was just breaking for  
parts / practice and the current MacBook I am writing this on was a  
replacement for a G4 one of our Apple technicians stuffed up at this  
stage, which left it without a microphone - something I can't do  
without when teaching KidPIx and Garageband!  It is not that bad -  
just be careful.

The only special tool you will need is a Torx T8 screwdriver. I got a  
set of Torx with the right size from my local hobby shop. Take your  
laptop to make sure it has one the correct size for the screws on the  
bottom.

Good luck - don't be scared - be confident and patient and get back to  
me (off list) if you need further help

Cheers
