<PRE>Brett,
I will be reading this thread with great interest. Our school bought 60
iBooks (700mhz) in May this year. Almost half of them have developed some of
the battery problems that I see posted here. By the way, they all have
Airport cards that are enabled all of the time, and all run OSX exclusively.
We do have AppleCare, but a &quot;genius&quot; told me that AppleCare won't even
consider replacing a battery unless we are getting less than an hour on a
full charge. So much for Apple's claim that it would get &quot;up to 6 hours&quot;.
Cheers,
John

</I>&gt;<i> Guy and iBook gang,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a bit behind in reading my iBook digests, but I was just about to
</I>&gt;<i> ask the same question of the list members when I came across this
</I>&gt;<i> posting. In my response, I have one question to you and one
</I>&gt;<i> (reiterating yours) to our colleagues here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Guy, what OS are you running? As observed on this list and
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere, OS 9 tends to have better energy management features than
</I>&gt;<i> OS X (especially since OS X's UNIX underpinnings were designed for
</I>&gt;<i> servers that would never be unplugged, as far as I understand) though
</I>&gt;<i> Apple seems to be working on this with each new OS X update. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> since your recent purchase of a wireless router, you are no doubt
</I>&gt;<i> running with your Airport card turned on much of the time, and it has
</I>&gt;<i> also been a frequent observation that Airport cards drain energy even
</I>&gt;<i> if they are just on and not connected; I, for example, have realized
</I>&gt;<i> much longer battery life (up till recently) just word processing or
</I>&gt;<i> playing simple games than when cruising the 'Net.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) That said, I now reiterate Guy's original question to members of
</I>&gt;<i> the list: how long, given daily use such as for a desktop but with
</I>&gt;<i> nightly shutdowns (and some weekends), does an average iBook (dual
</I>&gt;<i> USB for specificity's sake) battery last? I bought my trusty iceBook
</I>&gt;<i> just after Macworld NY 2001, and its once impressive battery life of
</I>&gt;<i> 3-5 hours has now withered to just over one hour (sometimes close to
</I>&gt;<i> two) under either OS 9.2.2 or OS X 10.1.4 (128 MB RAM). I've tried
</I>&gt;<i> resetting the Power Management Button (remove battery, press button,
</I>&gt;<i> wait, replace battery), and I've let my machine drain till it went to
</I>&gt;<i> sleep under its memory-saving warning and charged it all night. Still
</I>&gt;<i> the battery seems to be clearly faltering. Has this battery much
</I>&gt;<i> longer to live? If I purchase a new battery now, how long might this
</I>&gt;<i> original battery serve as an emergency backup? (Anecdotal responses
</I>&gt;<i> would be just fine, even from the Apple lurkers on the list.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your time and consideration.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cordially,
</I>&gt;<i> Brett
</I>
</PRE>
