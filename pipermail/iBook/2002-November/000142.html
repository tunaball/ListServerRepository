When I was first looking for a Clamshell, i did so after becoming 
intrigued by the form as seen on the web. it was really entertaining to 
read all of the legend and lore about the bomb-proof nature of the ibook.
I asked folks on this list and many replied with stories about their 
near death experiences with Clamshells. I have a Blueberry bought cheap 
on eBay because the owner must have dropped it and now the cd tray won't 
stay shut. When I took it out of the box, I was mesmerized by the 
silver-blue color.
The Sopranos features iBooks: Tony's daughter has a Graphite and his son 
a Blueberry. Svetlana, the one-legged Russian, is making a web page for 
her business  on an iceBook.
Anyone ever jump from a plane with an iBook? :)
