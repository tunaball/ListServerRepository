Sounds great. There's a USB keyboard you can get. can't remember the brand. An
80-key one is about AU$150, from memory. From the little I've seen they're
good. Have a gander at the Apple shop for suggestions.

Quoting <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">gooddog at interlync.com</A>:

&gt;<i> First of all, thank you one and all, Diana, Angus, and Howard.   
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the situation in a bit more detail, which will address the  
</I>&gt;<i> many questions raised:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The kid we're talking about is 13, and has only used Windows. My wife  
</I>&gt;<i> and I, the kid's mom, and the kid attended a GB demo on a Sunday  
</I>&gt;<i> morning at our local Apple Store. The musician who demo-ed did a  
</I>&gt;<i> great job, resulting in said teenager being in a lather to get GB and  
</I>&gt;<i> a Mac.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> His use would be as a beginner, though I let him borrow this iBook  
</I>&gt;<i> one time to give it a test run with his band mates from school (small  
</I>&gt;<i> college prep academy), who want to play rock music. They created a  
</I>&gt;<i> piece with several tracks using the loops, and had a blast doing so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> His other interest is the piano, which would be combined with GB for  
</I>&gt;<i> playing/recording. There are plans to get a keyboard to go along with  
</I>&gt;<i> his new gift (He's not aware of this current iteration of the gift.  
</I>&gt;<i> All he knows is that he's asked for a Mac, and it could be a family  
</I>&gt;<i> computer that all will share.). He's demonstrated considerable skill  
</I>&gt;<i> with playing piano, and immediately saw the potential for composing  
</I>&gt;<i> and creating music with a keyboard when he was at the GB demo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm wondering, is there any software or plug-ins that helps GB be  
</I>&gt;<i> used for lessons? What's a good keyboard? Would a keyboard work with  
</I>&gt;<i> this iBook?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I appreciate your help and response on this matter. I'm clued  
</I>&gt;<i> in enough to guide them toward the Mac, but with music, GB type  
</I>&gt;<i> material, I'm rather clueless.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mark
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
