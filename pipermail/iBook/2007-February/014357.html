<PRE>Doug, the problems with the white iBooks is related to design faults  
- this is from a good friend who is an Apple Distinguished Educator  
and who was lucky enough to spend some time at Cupertino with other  
Apple Distinguished Educators from around the planet at a retreat /  
conference. The problem was acknowledged by a senior Apple person and  
people lost their job over this. It has nothing to do with dirty  
electrical service. Interestingly, original designs (and possibly  
some prototypes - can't remember, had a handle like the clamshell!
In my experience in schools in NZ, a lot of it comes down to handling  
- laptops carried around with screens open etc are more susceptible.  
Some schools have had terrible runs while others have had little  
troubles. Of the very first 3 we got at the College of Education I  
was working at at the time, 2 had to go back almost straight away -  
there seems to have been batches of 'bad ones'. The sad thing is that  
one replacement logicboard did not fix the problem - I went through 3  
before they replaced my G4 with a MacBook. I would be the first to  
admit  though that I was pretty hard on my laptop - it went with the  
territory I was working in.
Hope this is of interest
