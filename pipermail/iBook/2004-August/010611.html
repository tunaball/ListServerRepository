Simon -

I couldn't agree more!

Sadly, the application of intelligence is not proportional or inversely
proportional to any other part of the equation, man/software for men.

The list mom should be contacted directly, by you as the progenitor,
preferably, and the request made for a safety net in these cases. Some &quot;What
If&quot; code makes too much sense to ignore.

Unfortunately, Jim will never prostate himself low or long enough to satisfy
the disturbance he caused with his First Class client, which apparently was
a new piece of software for him. (That may be a bit of speculation, though.)

As my father used to say when designing our first business computer system
back in 1976 (DEC PDP-8), you need to make systems &quot;idiot&quot; proof!

He would have enjoyed the state of personal computing today, however
ungainly it may be at times. RIP

Regards,

Geoff
