<PRE>I'll add my thanks for articulating what we MacFolk feel for our 
machines. I am a relative latecomer into the Mac scene (since 1997), 
but am now on my 3rd Mac. I felt pain when I had to throw out my old 
IIvx, faithful as it was, but I'm moving and am disposing of a lot of 
beloved treasures. However, I put my old (and still working) PM 7300 
(heavily upgraded to G3/400, 368mb RAM) into storage after carefully 
packing it into a padded carton; reason and future use for it unknown.

My love affair with Macs is sometimes taken to extremes and I get 
very, very defensive about my Mac and Apple in general to the degree 
that I have stood up in front of audiences and lectured them about 
the greatness and attributes of Macs when someone has tried to put 
them down. And, I froth at the mouth if anyone says anything negative 
about Macs in the same sentence that they try to elevate Windows and 
PCs.

I even treat my two laptops differently:  I am very careful, tender, 
and gentle when I move my iBook into its carrycase and travel with 
it. But, I just throw my Dell Latitude into its case and toss it into 
the back of the car without a second thought. It's like having a 
pretty and talented daughter whom I favor over a troublesome stepson 
who will never amount to much. I just hope my Dell doesn't have 
feelings...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Back in July 1999, a noted computer columnist, Walter Mossberg had 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that same problem. He had been at the MacWorld Expo in NYC when the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>first iMac was introduced. After he left the Expo, he wrote a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>column about his experiences and his puzzlement. He said that he 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>was fascinated by the Mac user's attachment to Macs and wanted to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>understand what powered it. So he stood behind the row of iMacs and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>watched the user reactions to the computers. He saw each person 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>approach the computer, smile when they got close, reach out to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>gently touch it, smile wider and get a soft glow on their faces, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Then they touched the mouse and started using the computer. At that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>point, he saw their entire face erupt into what he called a vision 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of pure joy. He still couldn't figure out what generated this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>response and was even more puzzled.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>He waited until the computer bank was almost deserted and tried it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>himself but still not answers. All the way home, it haunted him. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Why couldn't he figure it out? Was there a magic incantation or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>something that happened to users? When he got home and sat down at 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>his PC to write this puzzling column about this mysterious 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>response, he finally had a revelation. He said out of a clear blue 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>sky, he suddenly understood what was happening to Mac people: they 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>had a relationship with their computer. It was not a piece of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>machinery or a tool, it was a trusted and beloved friend. He said 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>as he realized this, he also realized that PC people never had this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>type of relationship with their computers. He also realized that he 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>never would get that kind of feeling or have that relationship with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>his computer and he felt a tear or two run down his cheek as he 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>realized how sad that made him feel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Since then, he has test many new Mac products and adores the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;sunflower&quot; iMac and ipods.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>When you made your comments about Macs, it was the same thing as if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you had called our significant others, inferior or defective. It's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the old adage, I can talk about my family, my boyfriend, my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>husband, but don't you dare criticize that person in my presence. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>You &quot;attacked&quot; our friend, whether you intended to or not, and you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>got immediate backlash from it. You came to our party and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>criticized our guest of honor, how did you expect us to react?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Had you said instead, this is my first mac and with my pc, I am 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>used to doing............, how can I do it with a Mac? You would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have had all the help and suggestions you could have ever wanted. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>But when you said, your mac doesn't do the things my pc does so 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>well or better, well, as you found out, those are fighting words, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you are dissing our friend at our party and you became an immediate 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>gate crasher and ungrateful guest.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Now do you begin to understand? We are not particularly interested 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>in how many people buy and use Macs, we are more interested in how 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>many people love and enjoy their Macs, warts and all. Just like an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>eccentric relative, some Macs are more lovable than others, some 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>are a bit quirkier but eccentric relatives just as valued and loved 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>as &quot;normal&quot; relatives. Sometimes, the eccentricity  of a person 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>makes them even more endearing, Well, sometimes the Mac 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>eccentricities make us more protective of that Mac also. Macs have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>personalities. Sometimes they fit us like a glove, sometimes, they 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>irritate us beyond endurance but they still enable us to feel 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>powerful and empowered because they will always let us be more than 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>we are without them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Some of us use Macs to keep in touch with a community if we are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>housebound. Some of us use Macs to earn the income we need to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>survive or thrive. Some of us use Macs to perform tasks we could 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>not do without a Mac. I am not a good artist but I yearn to be. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>With a Mac, some simple software, some time and inspiration, I have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>created some really good pieces of art. I have become a bit more of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>who I want to be because of my Mac.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I suggest you pick something you want to do that is just a bit more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>than you and ask your Mac to help you get there. It will be a great 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>journey for both of you.
