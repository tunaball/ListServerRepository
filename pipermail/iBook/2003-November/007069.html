<PRE>Jay,

I did make the upgrade from Jag to Panther on the same setup you 
describe - iBook SE 366 / RAM maxed at 320 MB.  Overall, I would 
estimate (I don't have any actual benchmarks) about 15-20% improvement 
in basic system &amp; Finder speed. Not only do I notice the speed boost, 
but things seem to be smoother in operation. I don't run Photoshop on 
this machine, but Office &amp; Acrobat are still a little slow to load 
(although scrolling through documents is a little quicker). I don't use 
this machine as my main workhorse (that's what my G4 iMac is for) &amp; am 
very happy with what it is. I don't get the eye candy, but I don't 
really care about that stuff. It's a trade off I have accepted for ease 
of use &amp; stability.

My overall recommendation is this...if you are able to acquire it 
through an educational channel for $69, then it is a worthwhile upgrade 
from Jag. I don't know if I would drop the full upgrade price on it. If 
you are moving from OS9 &amp; want to get into OSX, this is the upgrade you 
are looking for.

Admit nothing.
Deny everything.
Make counter accusations.
