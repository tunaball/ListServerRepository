<PRE>&gt;<i> It might be interesting to find out what computers and software Apple
</I>&gt;<i> uses for its own business needs. Does it do all of its accounting in
</I>&gt;<i> Filemaker? Are there any windows pcs or networking devices anywhere in
</I>&gt;<i> the Apple organization?
</I>
I can attest, they use nothing but Macs. I had the privilege of working 
for Apple and was able to see beneath the surface. They are a Mac only 
shop. In some areas, they are networked for sharing, in some areas, the 
sharing is very limited. The entire Apple &quot;System&quot; is totally 
integrated and networked so they can access any and everybody at any 
time. Access to specific files is always on a need to use basis just 
like in any corporate structure. The other remarkable element is the 
respect each employee has for Apple and the Apple corporate community. 
They are a family and a community. Working for Apple was the most 
enriching and rewarding work experience I have ever had and I was very 
sad when I was forced by family circumstances to terminate that 
employment. I miss that nurturing environment very much. Apple is a 
great company to work for.
