I found my first user group in 1987 or so. At that time I was spending 
way too much time on my Mac developing databases, still do. As I walked 
in the door I began to wonder where the people were hiding the next and 
previous buttons and my fingers instinctively typed command+q when I 
wanted to end a conversation.
