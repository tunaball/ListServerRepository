<PRE>I've discovered an interesting event with Safari and HTTPS with my 
bank, doesn't happen with Paypal or when using IE 5. The most relevant 
concern with Powerbook or iBook users is that this is a real battery 
drain.

Both Safari and IE 5 push the cpu usage, as seen in Activity Monitor in 
Panther, up to 95% and usually running 75-85% while the ssl page loads. 
IE 5 will drop to almost zero after the page loads but Safari stays 
revved at almost 90% after the page is loaded and as long as the page 
just sits there. This occurs when surfing my bank's web site.

As long as the htpps window is open, the cpu usage by Safari runs over 
85% whether the page is just left loaded in the tabbed interface or 
just sent to the background while another application is used.

Odd in that disconnecting from my modem doesn't stop the cpu usage so 
it must be something in the web page code.

Maybe it is just bad coding by the bank's web designers, I don't know. 
But IE does not have the same persistent cpu usage with the bank that 
Safari does. Safari does not have that problem with Paypal, so I am 
leaning to a problem with the bank's web pages.

I noticed this because my Powerbook began to overheat and the fan came 
on while I was surfing the bank's site. That's when I discovered the 
90% cpu usage after opening Activity Monitor.

I did transfer some Safari files from my 15&quot; Powerbook to the 17&quot; so 
that could be the villan, but I don't think so.

To summarize, Safari revs the cpu to 90% or so and keeps the pedal to 
the metal when I am surfing my bank via HTTPS. It does not do that with 
Paypal and Internet Explorer 5 does not do this. The 90% CPU will 
continue as long as the Safari page remains open, even if disconnected 
from the Internet.

Naturally this continual 90% cpu usage will drain the battery faster 
than 0% cpu usage. My 1.3 Gig 17&quot; does not overheat with Mail or 
Safari, as long as I am not using ssl and my bank. Then it gets real 
hot in the upper left corner near the powerplug.
