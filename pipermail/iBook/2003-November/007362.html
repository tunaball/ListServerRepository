Not sure if anything is deleted from the directory? As I understand it, the
move of a piece of data from a to b is added to the information of where it
is now located (b), but the old information (a) is not removed (it is just
not valid anymore). In this way, only when you rebuild a directory would the
latest location of the data (b) be listed (such as when you use DW) thereby
saving potential trouble (if you have moved a lot of files around several
hundreds of times) and time (only one entry initially and not having to go
through the list of it was here and then here and is now here). Have I
misunderstood something?

Additionally the files themselves are still scattered around the drive and I
would have thought that the defragmentation of the files would be of great
space and speed interest. For this you would need another utility such as
the earlier DW or Norton or others that were mentioned...
