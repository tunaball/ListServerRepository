I'm embarrassed and ashamed to say that this is a contest being run by 
the student-run newspaper on my college campus--the Kansas State 
University Daily Collegian. My guess is that someone just sent the 
first email out to every address in his/her address book without first 
checking to see if the email was going to individuals or lists. The 
contest must be a pretty big deal (I am unaware of anything other than 
that there is a contest) because an article in today's Collegian 
mentioned that there was voter fraud in the form of IP spoofing. If the 
contest runners will accept votes from anywhere in the world by linking 
to a web site, then it doesn't appear to be a well-thought-through 
contest. But then, we go to great lengths to point out that this is a 
student-run newspaper and, as such, will make mistakes from time to 
time. I don't usually put my entire signature when posting to this 
group, but by doing so, you will see why I am particularly embarrassed 
by having that message go out to groups such as this.
