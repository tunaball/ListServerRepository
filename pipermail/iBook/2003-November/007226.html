<PRE>&gt;<i> My goodness Mac vets, there has to be something about this machine to 
</I>&gt;<i> make =
</I>&gt;<i> you act this way ;). I have to find out what it is.
</I>
Back in July 1999, a noted computer columnist, Walter Mossberg had that 
same problem. He had been at the MacWorld Expo in NYC when the first 
iMac was introduced. After he left the Expo, he wrote a column about 
his experiences and his puzzlement. He said that he was fascinated by 
the Mac user's attachment to Macs and wanted to understand what powered 
it. So he stood behind the row of iMacs and watched the user reactions 
to the computers. He saw each person approach the computer, smile when 
they got close, reach out to gently touch it, smile wider and get a 
soft glow on their faces, Then they touched the mouse and started using 
the computer. At that point, he saw their entire face erupt into what 
he called a vision of pure joy. He still couldn't figure out what 
generated this response and was even more puzzled.

He waited until the computer bank was almost deserted and tried it 
himself but still not answers. All the way home, it haunted him. Why 
couldn't he figure it out? Was there a magic incantation or something 
that happened to users? When he got home and sat down at his PC to 
write this puzzling column about this mysterious response, he finally 
had a revelation. He said out of a clear blue sky, he suddenly 
understood what was happening to Mac people: they had a relationship 
with their computer. It was not a piece of machinery or a tool, it was 
a trusted and beloved friend. He said as he realized this, he also 
realized that PC people never had this type of relationship with their 
computers. He also realized that he never would get that kind of 
feeling or have that relationship with his computer and he felt a tear 
or two run down his cheek as he realized how sad that made him feel.

Since then, he has test many new Mac products and adores the 
&quot;sunflower&quot; iMac and ipods.

When you made your comments about Macs, it was the same thing as if you 
had called our significant others, inferior or defective. It's the old 
adage, I can talk about my family, my boyfriend, my husband, but don't 
you dare criticize that person in my presence. You &quot;attacked&quot; our 
friend, whether you intended to or not, and you got immediate backlash 
from it. You came to our party and criticized our guest of honor, how 
did you expect us to react?

Had you said instead, this is my first mac and with my pc, I am used to 
doing............, how can I do it with a Mac? You would have had all 
the help and suggestions you could have ever wanted. But when you said, 
your mac doesn't do the things my pc does so well or better, well, as 
you found out, those are fighting words, you are dissing our friend at 
our party and you became an immediate gate crasher and ungrateful guest.

Now do you begin to understand? We are not particularly interested in 
how many people buy and use Macs, we are more interested in how many 
people love and enjoy their Macs, warts and all. Just like an eccentric 
relative, some Macs are more lovable than others, some are a bit 
quirkier but eccentric relatives just as valued and loved as &quot;normal&quot; 
relatives. Sometimes, the eccentricity  of a person makes them even 
more endearing, Well, sometimes the Mac eccentricities make us more 
protective of that Mac also. Macs have personalities. Sometimes they 
fit us like a glove, sometimes, they irritate us beyond endurance but 
they still enable us to feel powerful and empowered because they will 
always let us be more than we are without them.

Some of us use Macs to keep in touch with a community if we are 
housebound. Some of us use Macs to earn the income we need to survive 
or thrive. Some of us use Macs to perform tasks we could not do without 
a Mac. I am not a good artist but I yearn to be. With a Mac, some 
simple software, some time and inspiration, I have created some really 
good pieces of art. I have become a bit more of who I want to be 
because of my Mac.

I suggest you pick something you want to do that is just a bit more 
than you and ask your Mac to help you get there. It will be a great 
journey for both of you.
