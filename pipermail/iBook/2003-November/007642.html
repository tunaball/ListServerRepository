Correct - but don't try to buy direct from Apple online or by phone because
no matter how much I've argued, I have never been able to get corporate
Apple to acknowledge that they shouldn't be charging tax to Ohio teachers
for computer purchases. If you've been luckier I'd like to know who you
talked to.

At the local Apple Store you might have better luck. Shortly after the Cincy
store opened the salesperson attempted to charge tax and the manager seemed
clueless about the Ohio statute giving school personnel tax exemptions for
some tech purchases. They just seemed totally ill equipped to be running a
business, but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt a few months
later. (No, I didn't buy the computer there, I went to MicroCenter which had
no trouble with my tax exempt status and even threw in a few freebies to
make up the $100 difference between their price and Apple education's.) On
my next visit the salesperson was also clueless about teachers being tax
exempt but I convinced him to get the manager who wasn't so clueless. It
added nearly 30 minutes to my shopping 'pleasure.'

IMHO Apple has a long way to go to make shopping at the Apple Store a better
experience than shopping at a local Apple specialist. Unfortunately, Apple
almost seems to purposely put their stores near successful Apple specialists
as if the intent is to put them out of business.
