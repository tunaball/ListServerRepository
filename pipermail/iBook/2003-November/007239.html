Hi Ron... How did you install Panther on your system?

When I received it, I initially did an upgrade install over 10.2.8. 
While it worked, I kept experiencing strange issues with networking, 
Safari, printing and so forth. After wiping the system clean and 
reinstalling Panther from scratch, I'm now back up and running.

Here's what I did, in sequence (I have a .mac account, and used the 
Apple Backup  utility)

1.	Used the Apple Backup program (the latest version) to backup the 
Mail message files and accounts, as well as my iPhoto library, and the 
contents of the Documents folder to an external drive (you could use a 
CD if your stuff fits; my data took about 12 Gb).

2.	Erased the disk and installed Panther. I then applied the security 
patches and updates (already!?!!).

3.	Downloaded the backup app from my .mac account (I have it somewhere, 
but with the number of CDs and DVD-Rs I've got laying around, it was 
faster that way). I then restored the files from my backup.

I had to supply passwords for my email accounts when I launched mail 
for the first time (seems I didn't backup the contents of the 
keychain). I have to After that, all's up and running fine. No more 
connectivity weirdness, problems with Safari and difficulties 
connecting to printers or network shares. Works for me.

And, yeah, I like it better than Jaguar. ;-)

Chris
