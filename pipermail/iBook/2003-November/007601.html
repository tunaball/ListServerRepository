<PRE>Hello to the list!

I am considering purchasing a new iBook G4.  I've always been a fan of 
small, super-portable laptops (my current laptop is a 12&quot; 600 MHz G3 
iBook), so I am automatically drawn to the 12&quot; model.  But, the 933 MHz 
G4 in the 14&quot; model sounds pretty attractive when compared to the 800 
MHz chip in the 12&quot; one.  So, I am torn between portability and power.

To those of you who have used a 14 inch iBook (G4 or not, it doesn't 
matter) - and ideally to those of you who have used both a 12 and a 14 
inch model:

1. How noticeable is the increase in weight? Is the 14 inch model a 
burden if you're carrying it around for several hours?

2. Is the 14 inch model too big to use in cramped spaces (coach airline 
seats, buses, back seats of automobiles, etc)?

3. Does the 14&quot; screen provide a more pleasant viewing experience, even 
though the resolution is the same as the 12&quot; screen?

4. Are there any other differences, positive or negative, that I'm 
missing - heat, battery length, Airport range/strength, etc? Or are 
these things not affected by the added size?

5. For a non-graphic arts person (I use web browsers, email, MS Office, 
Unix tools, Java programming tools, and do some light gaming - I do NOT 
use Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.) will the extra speed in the 933 MHz 
chip be noticeable?  I'm already expecting a big boost compared to what 
I'm used to experiencing -  going from a G3 to a G4, better bus, better 
RAM, better video card, etc.  So with all of those factors already in my 
favor, how much difference will the processor itself make?

I realize these are all pretty subjective questions with subjective 
answers, but that's exactly what I'm looking for - opinions and 
anecdotes.  I've already done a lot of research on the products myself, 
and know the &quot;technical&quot; answers to these questions.  But, anybody on 
the list that could help me make a more informed purchasing decision 
based upon their experiences would be much appreciated!

Thanks very much in advance!

- Mike W.
