</I>
It is. I started on Windoze PeeCees and switched to Macs some years 
ago 'cause I was sick and tired of screwing around with the systems; 
due to reasons previously mentioned, I still have to work with 
PeeCees. For comparison, I have a very good friend who is a 
Windoze/PC tech for a major national firm. When I mentioned I leave 
my Mac on 24/7, but have to reboot my Dell a couple three times each 
session, he said, &quot;Welcome to the world of Windows.&quot;  Frozen and 
missing cursors, computer freezes and crashes due to conflicitng 
applications/drivers/other software, and lack of consistancy of 
terminology are just part of the negative side of Windows life; it's 
not in Mac life.

&gt;<i>  You act like the MacOS has no problems, like it never crashes or 
</I>&gt;<i>freezes, or new OS X updates don't invalidate things that were 
</I>&gt;<i>already working ;). 
</I>&gt;<i>You just said yourself, when your dvd player goes down.  I 
</I>&gt;<i>understand your affinity for your platform or choice, but I know its 
</I>&gt;<i>not as bad as you make it out.  There are a few things that you have

</I>&gt;<i>the &quot;get what you pay for/value argument&quot;.
</I>
Yes, Macs are more expensive. So what? If one wants guaranteed 
quality, one has to spring the bucks. I just bought a Jeep Grand 
Cherokee because I wanted quality; I cudda bought a Kia.

&gt;<i>  They are slower,
</I>
Don't know where you got this idea. T'ain't true, McGee. I'll match 
my iBook 900 with any 1.2gb PeeCee any day of the week and twice on 
Sunday for speed.

&gt;<i>they less flexible with hardware choices
</I>
Hardware for PeeCees tends to be inferior (low cost:  ya git whatcha 
pay for) with poorly-written software, particularly drivers, which 
corrupts with time if it isn't corrupt out of the box. I don't know 
what PC hardware might be available that comparible hardware isn't 
available for Macs.

If you had stated that Macs are less flexible with SOFTWARE choices, 
I might have agreed since there ARE more software choices written for 
PCs than for Macs. The quantity is driven by the PC-dominated market. 
Quality of such choices is another issue; we seldom find junk 
software written for Macs.

&gt;<i>, and mostly behind the technology curve.  For as many innovations 
</I>&gt;<i>as Apple introduces, there are many more that they miss.
</I>
Apple has been, currently is, and probably will continue to lead the 
pack in innovations. F'r'instance, the new G5 with its 64-bit 
processors, 8gb of RAM, and a bus speed with so many zeroes I lost 
count. Has Dell/Celeron/Intel come out with anything even close? Oh 
yeah, don't forget about iPods which have gobbled up the MP3 market. 
The PC designers are scrambling just to catch up.

&gt;<i>Every platform has is problems, and in the end, it all balances out. 
</I>&gt;<i>You just have to find a platform that works for you, and leave it at 
</I>&gt;<i>that. 
</I>&gt;<i>The bashing is really not neccessary.  Can't we just play nice?
</I>
No. by sharing arguments among our fellow Mac-users, we pass along 
information for others to use when some misguided soul tries to tell 
us the Mac are &quot;behind the technology curve&quot;.
