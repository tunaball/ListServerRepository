It's brand new (three months old), used maybe ten times. If this 
turns out to be the problem, at least it's still under warranty.

Did it. I noticed the problem using the iBook's native CD burn software...

...Then, thinking there might be a problem with the iBook's CD burn 
software, I installed Toast Lite 5.2.1 which I happened to have on 
hand from my old 7300 when I tried installing a CD burner (which is 
why I broke down and upgraded to this iBook since I was having so 
much trouble installing the burner on the 7300)...

No difference with Toast. Same problem:  it reports error problems 
while trying to burn a CD. I downloaded Roxio's Toast Lite update 
5.2.1, but it wouldn't install since my Toast Lite CD is already 
updated to 5.2.1.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>3) Toast needs to be reinstalled or your preferences trashed.
</I>
Yesterday was the first I had installed Toast.

&gt;<i>4) You may have corrupt files you are trying to burn.
</I>
This may very well be the problem. I noticed the write-to-CD would 
stop at certain points, so I'd go into the assigned files/folders and 
delete those which were suspect. This sometimes got the CD to burn.

&gt;<i>5) You need to reread the manual.
</I>
Wasn't too helpful; didj'a ever notice that manuals seldom explain 
the error codes that you're experiencing?

&gt;<i>6) Something else...
</I>
I may go out and buy some GOOD blank CDs just to see if it's the 
cheap CDs causing the problem.

Will keep working on it.
