  take them to your local public school and donate them - just take them 
to the office- here in Portland they have a wide range of Macs -some so 
old  and beat up it would make you cry.
and for them to be able to swap a slightly newer one in can make all 
the difference in the world - at my daughter's school we are trying to 
get new enough computers so that they can all be using at least OS 8.1, 
yes some of them can go no higher than OS 7.5.3, many were even  below 
this and I bumped them up as high as I could. (the teachers say they  
want to upgrade to OS X but the machines just won't make it that high, 
so OS 9.1 is considered a huge achievement on those machines that can 
go that high.)
Old Mac monitors, mice, trackballs, and keyboards and printers are 
welcomed as well.
The teachers in my daughter's Odyssey program take the oldest computers 
and set them up for word processing and donate them to families without 
computers so they have something to work with at home.

I donated my upgraded 7100/66(now a 233mhz) running 9.1 and it was one 
of the fastest computers in the room...

As a side note, compared with the 30 Macs in my daughter's two 
classrooms, there are six old Windows/PCs that are rarely touched 
because they are unreliable, but there is pressure on the school to 
switch to Wiindows/Intel partly because many parents here work at 
Intel...

Sorry to ramble on, but I've been spending four hours a week as a 
volunteer, trying to patch up these old tired machines, when I first 
went to the school, I was expecting to see a bunch of old iMacs and 
maybe a few eMacs. They have some iMacs and no eMacs; mostly the 
machines are much older.
