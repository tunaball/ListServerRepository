<PRE>It also explains why so many of us have a collection of past Macs, sitting
in the garage/basement/attic. We are unable to throw the dears out because
we have that connection with them.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you act this way ;). I have to find out what it is.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Back in July 1999, a noted computer columnist, Walter Mossberg had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that same problem. He had been at the MacWorld Expo in NYC when the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first iMac was introduced. After he left the Expo, he wrote a column
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about his experiences and his puzzlement. He said that he was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fascinated by the Mac user's attachment to Macs and wanted to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand what powered it. So he stood behind the row of iMacs and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> watched the user reactions to the computers. He saw each person
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach the computer, smile when they got close, reach out to gently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> touch it, smile wider and get a soft glow on their faces, Then they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> touched the mouse and started using the computer. At that point, he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> saw their entire face erupt into what he called a vision of pure joy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He still couldn't figure out what generated this response and was even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more puzzled.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He waited until the computer bank was almost deserted and tried it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> himself but still not answers. All the way home, it haunted him. Why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> couldn't he figure it out? Was there a magic incantation or something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that happened to users? When he got home and sat down at his PC to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> write this puzzling column about this mysterious response, he finally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had a revelation. He said out of a clear blue sky, he suddenly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understood what was happening to Mac people: they had a relationship
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with their computer. It was not a piece of machinery or a tool, it was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a trusted and beloved friend. He said as he realized this, he also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> realized that PC people never had this type of relationship with their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computers. He also realized that he never would get that kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feeling or have that relationship with his computer and he felt a tear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or two run down his cheek as he realized how sad that made him feel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since then, he has test many new Mac products and adores the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;sunflower&quot; iMac and ipods.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When you made your comments about Macs, it was the same thing as if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you had called our significant others, inferior or defective. It's the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> old adage, I can talk about my family, my boyfriend, my husband, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't you dare criticize that person in my presence. You &quot;attacked&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our friend, whether you intended to or not, and you got immediate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backlash from it. You came to our party and criticized our guest of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> honor, how did you expect us to react?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Had you said instead, this is my first mac and with my pc, I am used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to doing............, how can I do it with a Mac? You would have had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the help and suggestions you could have ever wanted. But when you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> said, your mac doesn't do the things my pc does so well or better,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well, as you found out, those are fighting words, you are dissing our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> friend at our party and you became an immediate gate crasher and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ungrateful guest.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now do you begin to understand? We are not particularly interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how many people buy and use Macs, we are more interested in how many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people love and enjoy their Macs, warts and all. Just like an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eccentric relative, some Macs are more lovable than others, some are a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bit quirkier but eccentric relatives just as valued and loved as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;normal&quot; relatives. Sometimes, the eccentricity  of a person makes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them even more endearing, Well, sometimes the Mac eccentricities make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> us more protective of that Mac also. Macs have personalities.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sometimes they fit us like a glove, sometimes, they irritate us beyond
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> endurance but they still enable us to feel powerful and empowered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because they will always let us be more than we are without them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some of us use Macs to keep in touch with a community if we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> housebound. Some of us use Macs to earn the income we need to survive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or thrive. Some of us use Macs to perform tasks we could not do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without a Mac. I am not a good artist but I yearn to be. With a Mac,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some simple software, some time and inspiration, I have created some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really good pieces of art. I have become a bit more of who I want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be because of my Mac.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suggest you pick something you want to do that is just a bit more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than you and ask your Mac to help you get there. It will be a great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> journey for both of you.
