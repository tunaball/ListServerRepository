<PRE>Earlier this week I found that I couldn't get google.com to load and a 
few other sites won't load.  I spent more than an hour on line with my 
ISP's tech support and he decided that they had a problem beyond my 
local servers area and would be working on it.  I then called again 
last night to see what was being done...and they said it was fixed.

It wasn't for me...

So, today I called back and we did lots of tests again and still I'm 
unable to get to Google except thru the IP address which I was given on 
my first call...(I'm using it as my test address).  Now, I'm told that 
it is a problem with my machine...or maybe my Airport.  I have two 
different machines...a Titanium book running 10.2.6 and this iBook 
running 10.2.8 and neither of them can reach Google.  Could my Airport 
be going out?  Any other thoughts?  Odd to me that both are having the 
same problem.  I can't get there hooked directly to the cable line 
either for what that's worth...which makes me think the Airport's okay.

I'll have to call Apple Monday if none of you have ideas or have had a 
similar problem.  I'm using IE, Netscape and Safari between the two 
machines, by the way.

Have a good, unfrustrating weekend all!

Pat
