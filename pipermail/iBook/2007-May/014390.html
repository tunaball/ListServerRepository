&gt;<i>  I don't think snobbery is the issue here. The user had not received

</I>
Obviously people read the original post because just look at how many 
have jumped into this discussion on how to format. The reason there 
were no suggestions? No one had any suggestions or whomever had a 
suggestion decided not to post. It is doubtful a bad subject line was 
the reason for the silence on this list but let's ask anyway.

**Does anyone know the answer and have you refused to answer because 
the subject line wasn't specific?**

I'll go first. No, I don't know the answer and no, I wouldn't refuse 
to answer because of a badly written subject line.
