<PRE>This is not a matte of 'refusing to answer' but rather not bothering 
to read every post but instead only taking the time to read those 
posts that might be interesting or relative to someone's interest or 
knowledge.

The Internet is easily a source of information overload. We don't 
have the time or interest to read everything that is available to be 
read. If something catches our eye as interesting, or about something 
we already know something about, we are more likely to take the time 
to read it. A post titled 'Can someone help' is only going to attract 
those knights in shining white armor wanting to be there for everyone 
else in need but probably lacking in expertise as to the particular 
problem at hand. If the subject were instead 'I can't get my mail 
from my ISP', this might well attract the attention of someone who 
has recently gone through the issue and solved the problem as well as 
being willing to share their pain and joy at the answer. It might 
also be noted by the local mail expert.

It is always the original posters choice as to how to title the 
subject. Post something specific, or cry for help. I know which one 
is more productive. Do you?
