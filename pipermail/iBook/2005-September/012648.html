I don't see this. My son's account is managed, and I can enter my  
user name and password for any installation. One way around it is to  
create an Applications folder in his home folder (you'll notice it  
takes on the special Apps icon), and have him install things there.  
As long as the software doesn't install anything to the system, this  
is fine.

Yes, they may need to access certain system files, and his account  
may not allow this. Check something like Allow Supporting  
Applications (I'm not sure what it was called under Panther) to get  
around this - it should resolve the problem.

</I>
You can &quot;un-manage&quot; it. But don't go changing permissions on his  
files; that may lead to other problems.
