<PRE>While a friend and I (well mostly him) installed a new optical drive  
in my 14&quot; G4 ibook I attempted to dye the ibook case a deep blackish  
blue color.

I had read up on lacrosse players who had dyed their baskets and/or  
sticks using Rit dye.

I attempted to do the same thing

The ibook bottom case and battery cover came out a deep dark green.   
It looked like Italian marble.  Not what I wanted but it was kind of  
interesting.  Unfortunately the color has faded quite a bit in the  
ensuing 3 months.  Now it is a pale faint greenish color.  It's the  
bottom so it's hardly noticeable until you turn it over.  Not sure  
exactly why it is fading.  Ultra-violet?  Air?  The color is not  
rubbing off it is just fading away.

I still think a black ibook would look pretty neat...and it would  
remind me of my goregous Pismo.

I would attempt paint but have heard that it tends to chip off.   
Early ibooks could have the white stripped off (it was applied on the  
inside to a clear case) and then new paint sprayed on the inside.   
The 2nd gen ibooks have white plastic so it's either dye (so far not  
real successful) or paint (which chips).

If you've had success with colorizing your ibook I would like to hear  
about it.  And no, I don't want to pay someone several hundred  
dollars to do it for me.  Just not in my budget plus I like the idea  
of DIY.
</PRE>
