The problem is with the installers.  There are several programs I 
have installed from a non-admin account by just using my admin user 
id and password.  What you probably need to do is use the Get Info 
command to set the permissions for that application or it's folder to:

Owner - system
Access - Read &amp; Write

Group - admin
Access - Read &amp; Write

Others - Read Only


And apply to enclosed items

If the applications are OS 9 this also applies.
