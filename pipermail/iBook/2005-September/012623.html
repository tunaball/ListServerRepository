<PRE>I've finally, finally, long, long overdue, ordered myself a new 12&quot; ibook.

(My original ibook, at 33 mhz with its 3 gigs of memory has only 329 mg of
space left!  I've been throwing things out in order to add anything, and oh,
my, but downloading pages online has been Slooow.  Not to speak of frequent
freezes when the poor thing is overcome .  And still running OS9.1!)

I am about to enter the world of OSX!  I'll be able to take advantage of
.mac  and for the first time to go to itunes online and finally use iphoto
!!   I've bought airport express too, so, Oh, I am going to be wireless!
Yes!  And I've upgraded to 60 gigs.  60gigs!!! after 2 and 3/4 gigs!!! Can
you imagine How Excited I am???!!!

But I have a question.

I will upgrade the memory.  This new 12&quot; ibook (upgraded to 60 gigs),
1.33ghz,  comes standard with removeable 512 mg.

Should I add 512 mg memory  for a total of 1 gig?  (Other World Computing
has a price of $59.99; Crucial a price of $68.99)(Those are both good
companies still, right?)

or should I add  1 gig of memory (Other World Computing $136.95/ Crucial
$159) for a total of 1 and 1/2 gigs?

I'm guessing you'd ask how I use my computer.  PresentlyI don't shoot/edit
video (not yet, at least... probably will be a year or so before I can get
to that, but I may inherit a dual tower G-3 to do that work on... so I doubt
I'd be editing on this laptop).  I will watch dvds.  I will start adding
digital photos like crazy.   I will instantly start downloading my cds onto
my computer so that I can wing them to my stereo in the other room.
And  I do lots of research online, with multiple windows open from multiple
sites... often 10 - 15 downloading articles while reading others

I'm speculating that the demands of Tiger will mean I should, without doubt,
certainly bump up 256 mg for a total of 768 mgs and more comfortably so,
bump up 512 for a total of a gig.   Do you agree?

And if so, then would  there be a significant difference  in speed of
internet page downloading by adding a gig to bring me to a gig and a half.
???  

I hate waiting for the pages to download.... presently they take way, way
too long for efficient work, so I really want to change that, especially
given how much time I spend online.    But am I overcompensating?  Or is
this a worthwhile investment?

 (Yes, I'm using broadband... about T1 speed)

Thanks in advance for your expertise, advice, experience which make this
such a great list!

Jill
