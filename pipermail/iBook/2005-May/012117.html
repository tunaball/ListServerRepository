<PRE>I just installed RAM on 2  G4 12' iBooks yesterday, and I noticed  
that the keyboards were pretty funky, they gave me a lot more trouble  
than the keyboard on my G3 iBook ever did (of course...the logic  
board made up for it...).

If you are comfortable, I would try re-seating it...and take your  
time, be patient, and make sure you get it in there right.  There is  
a small tab on the bottom of the keyboard, towards the middle,  just  
about 1/4 of an inch to the right of the right end of the space bar.   
This tab gave me some problems, and on one I actually had to exert  
pressure above it after seating the rest of the keyboard.  I would  
think that if this were not in place correctly, it could have a  
negative impact on the movement, and there fore function, of the  
space key.

If that doesn't work, I would take it in...it's still under warranty,  
right? I did have to replace the keyboard on my G3 iBook (after it  
was mangled by a third-party logic repair attempt gone bad).  It was  
a result of damage to the ribbon...which could also be your problem.

Hope that helps!

Samantha



&gt;<i> My wife also had the same issue.  I tried to re-seat the keyboard  on
</I>&gt;<i> many occasions, to no avail.  As her book was under warranty I took it
</I>&gt;<i> back.  I'm not sure whether they replaced the keyboard or not, but it
</I>&gt;<i> works now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd suggest taking it in.  This seems to be a fairly common problem
</I>&gt;<i> with this iBook model.
