<PRE>Hi there,


&gt;<i>This weekend, my husband and I decided to take the plunge and 
</I>&gt;<i>purchase 2 iBook G4s.  Because our local Apple Store is not due to 
</I>&gt;<i>open until the fall, we went to CompUSA.
</I>

I just got my iBook G4 two weeks ago tomorrow - and I LOVE IT... I 
shopped around online but wound up buying mine live and in-person 
from an Apple Store in Kansas City (on the Plaza, FWIW) - even though 
it was a 75 mile drive to get there.

I have NEVER had a &quot;good&quot; shopping experience at CompUSA, and the 
only reason I ever did go there (especially since they are 90 miles 
away!) was as a last resort... to get laser toner or something not 
found in our &quot;small town&quot; area, but that I was so desperate for that 
I could not wait for a catalog co. to ship it here.... I always felt 
that the CompUSA salespeople were just as you described - ignorant of 
all things Mac/Apple - and seemed to care LESS about the products - 
and were hard to get to help me, in general.  I avoid the store like 
the plague! :-/

Especially since you were dropping a &quot;load&quot; of money (in my opinion, 
having just bought ONE iBook... you spent a LOAD!) - it is even all 
the more annoying that you were treated shabbily.

Other than that, how do you like the iBooks?  And a quick unrelated 
note, probably a stupid question - but what does the &quot;i&quot; in all of 
this stand for? Ever since the iMac came out, I never knew what the 
heck it was short for... I've usually had Power Macs, etc. and not an 
&quot;i&quot; product.

Take care,
Michelle &amp; Herd
</PRE>
