<PRE>This is an interesting point.  Our CompUSA is set up the same way.   
As a result, I had hoped that the Apple portion would be fairly  
autonomous from the reminder of the store.  However, this was not the  
case.

In fact, the Apple guy that was there was particularly offensive, and  
essentially told us that we had made his morning very difficult by  
coming back to get our copy of Tiger, when Panther should work just  
fine for what we needed. I was shocked, because this happened at the  
same time that we were buying our second iBook (after spending the  
night pondering whether we should purchase a second iBook or a Mini).

So, there we are, dropping another $1000, and he's complaining that  
we are asking for the OS that they told us would be in the box in the  
first place.  Plus, why on earth is Apple hyping Tiger (okay, the  
obvious marketing reasons) if Panther should be just as good for us?

Of course, he was the same guy that couldn't figure out why we had a  
problem with a dead spot on the trackpad. Never-mind that we had just  
bought a brand new computer...it felt like he thought we were silly  
for expecting it to be 'perfect' right out of the box. To tell the  
truth, we seriously considered just dealing with it...we were so  
opposed to dealing with CompUSA again, but...it was a real pain to  
deal with a poorly functioning trackpad.

On a side note, it took them 3 tries to find a replacement that was  
packaged with a copy of Tiger...and they thought we were wrong when  
we told them that the first one was missing it.

Maybe we just got stuck with a lousy Apple guy, but I will be  
thrilled when the Apple Store opens here later this year, and even  
more thrilled when Apple wakes up and drops their agreement with  
CompUSA. I can't imagine that this is the kind of customer relations  
that Apple intended to provide.
