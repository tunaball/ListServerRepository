Chas, you crack me up.  It's so true.  He's thinking of the original OS 
X, probably, when it was first released or was in Beta.  He's a great 
guy with obsolete information.  Is it that with Quark being so behind 
in going to OS X, this is his hang up?  Quark is their mainstay.

By they way, the Trainer at work &quot;loves&quot; Microsoft and there products, 
and practically came in her pants when she was telling us how we're 
moving to even MORE MS products.  I sent her links to your website with 
the hysterical and educational articles about MS.  I asked her to 
comment about your assertions and observations.  She's never gotten 
back to me.  Too funny.

</I>&gt;<i>

Since there may be a &quot;cheap&quot; factor going on here, does this affect the 
quality of LCD I might get?  Or are LCD's pretty much a good bet all 
around?  If I need to request a certain brand, let me know if anyone 
has a suggestion.  You can CC me at <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">gooddogcomics at mac.com</A> since I can 
check that from work.  I'd prefer to get the ball rolling on this right 
away.

Thanks for the help. I really appreciate it.

Mark
