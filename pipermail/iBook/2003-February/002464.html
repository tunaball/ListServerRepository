No, sorry, verifying before Shutdown has ALWAYS been there in OS 
9,8,7,6....

As far as being stupid enough to hit the wrong button...before the USB 
revolution Mac keyboards were scarce.  And I bought TWO different 
models that have the Power Key right there next to the Shift Key, 
instead of the upper right of the keyboard where God and Apple intended 
it to be.  I even called the company to complain.   I trained myself to 
be more careful but still hit it occasionally.

So, no, I think Verify before Shutdown is a GOOD thing.   As for 
updates, welcome to the world of huge downloads and slow phone lines.   
Updating isn't mandatory, you know.   Jag works fine without updating.








I once thought about starting a club to discuss the philosophy of 
Fatalism.
But then I realized that even if anyone came, they'd only come to steal 
the folding chairs.
