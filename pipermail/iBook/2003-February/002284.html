<PRE>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">good-dog at northshore.net</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Chas, you crack me up.  It's so true.  He's thinking of the original OS
</I>&gt;<i> X, probably, when it was first released or was in Beta.  He's a great
</I>&gt;<i> guy with obsolete information.  Is it that with Quark being so behind
</I>&gt;<i> in going to OS X, this is his hang up?  Quark is their mainstay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I want to correct the impression some people might have gotten that 
there is no good reason *at all* for not moving to OS X. Of course 
there are good reasons for not moving to OS X. Some people have 
*excellent* reasons for not moving to OS X (in the short term, anyway) 
and I respect them.

But saying &quot;it's not stable&quot; isn't one of them.

OTOH, saying &quot;we're waiting for Quark to come out with an OS X native 
version&quot; is a reasonably acceptable one. Personally, I keep Classic in 
the background and use Quark whenever I need to (less and less often, 
thanks to InDesign) and version 5.0 seems to work *flawlessly* and VERY 
quickly in Classic. Since Acrobat Distiller is *also* not ready for OS 
X, the use of Classic for these two apps works very well for me. I have 
Classic set to &quot;sleep&quot; after five minutes of non-use so it *never* bogs 
me down when I'm not using it. Your art dept head might consider this.

A better reason not to move to OS X would be something like &quot;our 
scanners aren't yet/will never be supported&quot; or &quot;the Photoshop plugins 
we depend on aren't OS X ready yet.&quot; These are very good reasons to 
stick with 9 for a while yet. You tell him I said he needs to visit the 
OS X Excuse jar and get a fresh batch -- his current ones are stale. :)

&gt;<i> I sent her links to your website with
</I>&gt;<i> the hysterical and educational articles about MS.  I asked her to
</I>&gt;<i> comment about your assertions and observations.  She's never gotten
</I>&gt;<i> back to me.  Too funny.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
At the risk of sounding like I'm tooting my own horn, here's a sample 
of what Rick is talking about if you're curious:

<A HREF="http://thechasbah.blogspot.com/2002_10_27_thechasbah_archive.html">http://thechasbah.blogspot.com/2002_10_27_thechasbah_archive.html</A>

Be sure to check out the links. My blog is amusing, but the reality of 
Microsoft is so scary it's hilarious.

&gt;<i> Since there may be a &quot;cheap&quot; factor going on here, does this affect the
</I>&gt;<i> quality of LCD I might get?
</I>
Yes. Analog LCDs (read: most PC models) are fuzzy and although they 
don't flicker (which seems to be your main problem), they look 
considerably worse than nice all-digital monitors like Apple's. If 
possible, see if you can go for an all digital solution (involves a DVI 
video card AND the monitor rather than just the monitor).

&gt;<i> If I need to request a certain brand, let me know if anyone
</I>&gt;<i> has a suggestion.  You can CC me at <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">gooddogcomics at mac.com</A> since I can
</I>&gt;<i> check that from work.  I'd prefer to get the ball rolling on this right
</I>&gt;<i> away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'd suggest Apple. :)
