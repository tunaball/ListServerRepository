<PRE> From my personal experience and everything I've read Lexmark deskjet 
printers have by far the highest cost per page of any printer. You will 
recoup the expense of a new printer very quickly.
I can't answer for quality, that seems to change very fast. The latest 
Consumers Reports top rated one of the Canon's but I don't remember 
which one. I use a Canon S300 which was cheap to buy and is cheap to 
run ( Canon brand black ink cartridges are only $12. and last fairly 
long ). I think I would try one of the nicer models. This one is  only 
ok at photos, and is the loudest printer I have ever seen. Sometimes it 
prints straight off and other times it cycles back and forth, clicking 
and clacking like a madman for the better part of a minute before it 
takes off.
  I've had good luck with HP also. With HP check the price of the ink 
cartridge and how much ink it holds before you buy. My son has a HP 812 
and my wife has a 882. The cartridges look the same but won't 
interchange. They cost the same but the 812 holds half as much ink. The 
$50 difference was made up by the second cartridge and the 882 is much 
faster and quieter too boot.
I've noticed that some models now have 5 or more different color ink 
tanks. This is for photo's where shading and transitions are critical. 
If you don't do a lot photo's I'd bet the other models are better and 
cheaper for regular use.
Happy hunting.
