She'll be playing a new Windows 3-D Game:  Dell into Dumpster

I'm assuming, then, that if she has a Mac OS X version of Office she 
can write Excel documents and send them to her Windows cohorts, and her 
Windows cohorts can send her Excel documents and she can read them no 
problem.  What about being able to access the network and work on 
documents, you know, opening them, changing them, saving them? From 
what you say, this should be easy.

Since writing this initial message, there's an outside chance I could 
work on a mac at work, too.  This would resolve many things, including 
the LCD vs CRT issue I've mentioned before.  We work on a Novel network 
with an ever increasing MS products line.  Who knows, the way things 
are going, the server would well become Windows.  Our email system is 
Groupwise.  Familiar with it?  I'm going to pitch my idea about me 
using a Mac (iMac with the fastest processor and most memory it can 
come with) for various Sales Dept. duties involving graphics and 
managing graphics as they transition themselves into the hands of the 
OS X Un-friendly Communications Dept (read Graphics).

Based on what you say, I'd be running VPC 6.  My only concern is if VPC 
would run fast enough on a high end iMac to be usable in everyday 
Windows activities since we are on Novell.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and if she really wants to fit in to that Windows group, she'd 
</I>&gt;<i> probably better download a copy of Solitaire. :)
</I>
I'll tell her about this strategy.  If they see her playing Solitaire 
on the iMac, maybe they'll think she's really on a PC.  Many people at 
her work aren't the swiftest ever hatched.

Thanks.

Mark
