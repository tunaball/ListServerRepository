I nearly creied when I lost an auction like yours on ebay for a Key Lime 
iBook. It also had a complete airport system and iSub set up! I was 
HEARTBROKEN for the first time over an auction. I know that this is a 
little pathological :)
The worst part...it had a custom 30GB HD!!!!
I don't want this flashback :(

I found the whole Titanium/ice generation of portables bland and too 
industrial when they first came out. But check out those iceBooks in 
action in a room and you'll be impressed by their elegance.
Don't get me wrong, I'm praying that the patent Apple took out for 
color-changing plastic means that we'll be getting back to some 
colorful, playful design!
Anyway, we key Lime owners definitely have a piece of history.
