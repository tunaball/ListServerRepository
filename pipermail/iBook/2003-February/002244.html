<PRE>&gt;<i>I have an 800 MHz iBook. I'm trying to download the latest version of 
</I>&gt;<i>iMovie. I keep losing my internet connection. I turned off the &quot;sleep&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>function in System Prefs, thinking that was the problem, but that 
</I>&gt;<i>didn't help. I've had this happen before on large downloads. Any 
</I>&gt;<i>suggestions?
</I>
Downloading stuff from the Apple website can be problematic, especially 
something as popular as iMovie's latest release. Try doing it in the 
middle of the night. 


&gt;<i>Here's the second question. When I was using Omniweb, if I lost my 
</I>&gt;<i>connection during a download, when I dialed up again the download took 
</I>&gt;<i>up where it had stopped; I didn't lose what I had already gotten. Now 
</I>&gt;<i>I'm using Safari, which doesn't seem to have the same feature. When I 
</I>&gt;<i>dial up, the download goes nowhere and the only option seems to be 
</I>&gt;<i>starting over. I have over half of iMovie downloaded (for the second or 
</I>&gt;<i>third time) and I'd love to be able to take up where I left off. Any 
</I>&gt;<i>suggestions for this problem?
</I>
Uh, go back to Omniweb? Some browsers support resuming stopped downloads, 
others don't. I've not used Safari. Does it have a &quot;Download Manager&quot; 
window, or something like that? If so, go there and click on the line for 
your download. It might open a window that will allow you to resume.

Failing that, I'd suggest a good download manager, like Speed Download. 
There are others, as well. They can usually queue a list of downloads, 
then go through them in order. Many have the capability to resume a 
stopped download--check the specs. Go to Version Tracker and search on 
&quot;download&quot; or &quot;download manager.&quot; They can also make multiple 
connections, which isn't much of a help with a dialup connection, but can 
be with a high-speed connection like DSL or a cable modem. Speed Download 
has worked pretty well for me in OS 9.2.2. There is an OS X version, I 
believe.
