<PRE>I got my iBook on December 17th and it totally crashed (frozen blue 
screen on startup) last Monday just after I did a software update 
(downloaded iMovie upgrade). Running OS 10.2.3, 800 Mhz. I'd owned the 
computer for 49 days.

Took it to Apple Store --- spent about 5 hours in there - they tried a 
bunch of things - ended up trying to reinstall OS X but that would just 
crash to a blue screen in the middle of the installation.

I left it there - they were able to &quot;recover&quot; my hard drive (I had to 
pay $50 for a data transfer). I picked it up last night and they'd 
managed to reinstall OS X. I couldn't find out from them what had 
happened - all they would say was that the hard drive must have been 
very corrupted.

I was able to get my photos into the iPhoto library and have burned 
them onto a cd.

I was able to get my music back into iTunes.

I cannot get my extensive calendar information back into iCal and the 
apple store geniuses were not able to do that either - just could not 
figure out how, even though the calendars seem to be in my archives and 
we tried to import them - looks like it is working, but no calendar 
information appears.

The WORST result is that iChat doesn't work. I can see my buddy list, 
it appears to be working - shows who is available, etc. People can IM 
me and I can receive their IMs. But I cannot type into the send box and 
so cannot send IMs to anybody. I thought maybe this would be magically 
corrected if I redid the OS X update to 10.2.3 - so I did that - but it 
didn't work.

Ideas to get my calendar info into iCal or to get iChat working?
