<PRE>Thank you, Linda for your help. I downloaded 10.2.3 (supposedly) and 
then found out that I needed to &quot;install&quot; it. Tonight I did that. After 
five hours of being online, watching that scroll thing move slower than 
anything can move, it came up with a &quot;cannot finish, a problem was 
detected&quot; message.

It used to be that Macintosh was the best computer. All you had to do 
was hit a few keys and everything was installed. Now they are worse than 
any PC I've ever met. Three and a half hours to download it, and over 
five to be told it couldn't be done. And now that I have Jag, it also 
has the gall to ask if I'm sure I want to shut down. Macs never did that 
before. PC's always ask you to verify if you want to shut down, but 
until this install, I had never heard of such a thing on a Mac. What an 
insult. You hit the shut down or restart button and it asks you if you 
really mean it, or are you so stupid that you hit the button by accident.

I'm really sorry I got this Mac. May the universe forgive me. BTW, the 
install was supposed to be for 10.2.4. That was probably the screw up. I 
downloaded 10.2.3 and it thought I had downloaded 10.2.4. I'm going bald 
waiting for some release from the frustration. And none of these 
downloads or installs EVER tell you beforehand, how long you can expect 
them to take.

Can anyone out there save my sanity?
Ally
