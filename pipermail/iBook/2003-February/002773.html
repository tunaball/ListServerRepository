Hey! I heard that!

Okay, here's the deal:

I got ill a week ago. Very ill. I haven't been to work since, and haven't
checked my email either, since I am rebuilding my house and hence have no
Internet connection at home.

Normally, this should not be a problem; even though I get quite a bit of
email, a week's load shouldn't be a problem so I reckoned I'd just see what
the router dragged in by the time I got back to work.

However, an ex-colleague of mine sent me 3 MB worth of funny videos through
email almost the instant I called in sick, so my mailbox was flooded just
about from that moment on. This would explain the bouncing email mayhem on
this list (and quite a few others!).

So, I hereby apologise for the inconvenience caused to you all, and

</I>&gt;<i> The first Joost is the one that is being returned. Perhaps the dot Mac account

</I>
Well, those domains are both mine. As some of you have since figured out,
Dasja.net is my girlfriend's, Jvdg.net is mine. Jvdg.net is much older, and
is hosted by a crappy hosting company I don't like very much but can't seem
to get rid of, which doesn't provide true (POP) email support, but only
forwarding. So email sent there is forwarded to my &quot;real&quot; email account at
dasja.net. Easy as pie, really.

Until something goes wrong and I have to figure out where in the chain the
fault lies, but that is another story.

&gt;<i> The sequence is this, traced via a few old emails:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Joost van de Griek &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">gyorpb at mac.com</A>&gt;  someone might visit the site, if you can,
</I>&gt;<i> and see if it is active. This email does not bounce.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">joost at jvdg.net</A>  -- jdvg.net -- a discontinued free web site that forwards the
</I>&gt;<i> mail to 
</I>
Discontinued? Where did you get that idea?

&gt;<i> <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">joost at dasja.net</A>  -- his girlfriends free web site that has a picture of her
</I>&gt;<i> and Joost van de Griek at www.dasja.net. His email account bounces so maybe
</I>&gt;<i> something... 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last two mailboxes bounce.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The dot mac email address has produced no response to an email I sent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The issue would be solved if the list mom would simply delete the
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">joost at jvdg.net</A> subscription since the web site and mail box are discontinued.
</I>
Dude, you might want to check your facts before you go jumping to any
conclusions. Where did you get the idea that my domains and/or email boxes
have expired/been discontinued?

Also, I would appreciate it if you wouldn't publish any more email addresses
of mine on any mailing lists without my permission, no matter where you got
them. There is a reason I choose which email address I use for a certain
purpose, I hope you can respect that.
