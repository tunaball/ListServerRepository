</I>Guy - your computer might panic but there&#185;s no need for you to as well
&lt;grin&gt; I always hate to give people advice about how to backup because I
never know where they might have stuff hidden. I prefer to look through
their computer and do it myself.

Having said that, if you back up the Library folder in your personal
directory you should catch everything you need. Notice I said should.
Microsoft products have a MS User Data folder in Documents. To be safe,
assuming you have a CDR equipped machine, backup your entire personal folder
and you should be good to go.

For future reference, doing OS updates are always a bit dangerous. On my
desktops at home and work I have two drives and I clone my system so when an
update comes along I update without worry. On the &#140;Books that isn&#185;t quite as
doable; at least for me. My drive is too full to partition for another
system. But I have a firewire drive that I use to clone my iBook&#185;s system.
That might not be doable for you and if it isn&#185;t then I recommend holding
off on system updates until others find out all the foibles for you. As
Charles has pointed out, your problem affects a small group of users. This
seems to happen with all updates.

As to XP looking better - yeah right. Although I practice safe computing as
described above, I&#185;ve never been personally bitten by any of the OS X update
bugs. They do tend to be rare. That is cold comfort for those who have been
struck, but it is the truth. The truth about XP is a different matter.

I&#185;ll tell you just about the problems I&#185;ve had that I know to be typical -
since I work in a mixed environment I have lots of experience.
Unfortunately. I won&#185;t even go into my update experience. Apple gets high
marks for making the upgrade from 9 to X easy. Microsoft gets an F for
updating to XP from a previous system.

XP gets in your face and won&#185;t get out of it. Have a folder of pictures? XP
assumes you want to view them so when you open the folder you get a picture
browser instead of a normal folder of files. Convenient, unless you don&#185;t
want that. Takes a while to figure out how to change this viewing method -
and that is the MS experience in the nutshell. Have a folder of pictures or
mp3s? XP wants to help you burn them to CD; even if that isn&#185;t what you
want. Want to share files with another computer on your network? No one step
setup here. And if you create a shortcut them dang thing seems to break
every other week. What about sleeping and hibernating? Nice. But my machine
seems to always wake up shortly after going to sleep. When I come home from
work my home machine is almost always awake and waiting for me. Convenient,
but not when I don&#185;t want it too. One of the reasons, but not the sole
reason, is my PocketPC. If my PPC is docked and an alarm goes off, it wakes
the computer. And if I dock it so I can recharge the battery it also wakes
up the computer. Don&#185;t want that. Can&#185;t stop it.

Then lets talk about the security updates. It seems like every week or two
MS is telling me to download another security update. I must have wasted 10
hours since upgrading to XP on just downloading and installing updates. And
then there was the massive XPSP1 - the first service patch. I have broadband
at home. It took nearly 4 hours to download and install the service patch.
And it took nearly that long for my notebook at work. Still haven&#185;t gotten
around to doing my work desktop.

I&#185;ve reinstalled XP on my work desktop twice now. Just before the new year,
my machine started getting wacky unstable and slow. I did all the usual
things. No viri, no adware, nothing obvious. A new account (also an XP
trick) did no good. But hey, after the reinstall my machine was like new
again. In other words, XP suffers from the same creeping cruditis that all
windows versions has. It is the registry. My home desktop got a reinstall
because of a new DVD burner. After installing it my computer refused to go
into standby or hibernation. It locked up. The tech I talked to (boy wasn&#185;t
it a joy getting hold of one) immediately knew the problem and the solution.
He said, &#179;Oh yes. You need to wipe your drive and reinstall windows. Then
make sure the the first thing you install are the drivers and software for
the DVD. Seems the DVD and some CD burners don&#185;t coexist well unless the DVD
is installed first. Since it was a gift without a receipt I couldn&#185;t take it
back. Bah!

So whenever I hear someone talk about a reverse switch I just think about
Monty Python and The Holy Grail. To paraphrase - &#179;I laugh in your general
direction.&#178;
