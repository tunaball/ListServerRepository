<PRE>Where I work we use PC's mostly (the art department has the macs, but 
even there, the head guy says stuff like &quot;We ain't moving to OS X for a 
long time. Too much trouble and it's not stable.&quot; I don't get it, but I 
don't get a lot), and it's pretty much a CRT screen environment.

Lately I've been noticing my eyes feel not so good after looking at the 
CRT screen all day (prior to this job, which I started in July, I 
didn't look at a computer all day).  At home I use my ibook with it's 
LCD screen, and the feelings in my eyes are not the same as when I look 
at the CRT types.  There also seems to be a difference between the Mac 
screen and the PC screen resolution or something.  When I look at the 
new iMac at the stores, the screen is easy to look at and not 
burdensome.

I've used some of the flat screen monitors at work in the training 
room, and they're much nicer to look at, so I'm thinking of asking for 
one of those kinds.

Does anyone know what the effects of one screen are versus the other?  
Is  there a difference?  IT seems the PC screen is vibrating sometimes, 
where as the Mac is calm.  Are there any resources online where I can 
read up on this?

Sorry if this isn't the most coherent message.  I just got in from my 
day.

Thanks.

Mark
