<PRE>Let's devote this thread to consider POSSIBLE problems from using an 
unprotected wifi connection. Another thread can consider the reasons 
why it is OK. This one should offer ideas as to why it might not be 
safe.

LEGAL PROBLEMS
Obviously there may be laws against using someone else's channels 
without their permission. And there may be not. So, you might get 
arrested in one state or county or city while not in another.

Even if there is no specific law against it, there may be other laws 
that you could be charged with.

Defending yourself against these laws can be quite expensive, even if 
you win. Being arrested, handcuffed and booked can't be good for the 
reputation and even if after being questioned at the station (as they 
say on tv) you are let free, the experience isn't a rewarding one.

UNPROTECTED CONNECTIONS
You don't know who put up the unprotected connection and what they 
might do to you (hacker, police entrapment, etc).

There may be no firewall which might leave you vulnerable to all kinds 
of internet attacks if you do not have an active software firewall. If 
you have file sharing turned on, you might be sharing your files with 
anyone on the internet.

Your password, email and surfing are easily seen by someone else. 
Remember, every bit of data that flows into and out of the wifi base 
station can be intercepted and read by someone controlling the base 
station just as a phone can be tapped.

Your transmissions can be captured and recorded for later reading.

Some one said someone said that the cpu serial number can't be read 
(would be tossed out in court as hearsay, I would imagine). Don't need 
to. You are sending your ISP account name and password when you log in 
for your email. Each email header has your address and other 
identifying info. The date and time sent for instance might prove you 
were using their wifi channel while eating in their cafeteria, proven 
by your charge card receipt. If you use a microsoft mailer, it may even 
include the id or serial number of the mailer.

Your browser maintains cookies and a dated history log. These can be 
analyzed to show you were in that cafeteria.

You might even be sent a virus, trojan horse, etc. and later on end up 
transmitting your checking account files to a bad guy.

While you are sitting in that cafeteria broadcasting your surfing to 
anyone within 150 feet or so, there maybe someone else there who has 
the means to capture your transmissions, etc. or has their computer set 
up to act as a base station.
