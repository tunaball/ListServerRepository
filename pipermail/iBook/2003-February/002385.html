I can't find the reply to my original post which led me to the apple 
discussion board discussing this problem.  I believe it was Charles 
Martin which send me the URL.  Anyway, there is a bug in the system 
that affects laptops.  It's a bug that causes a kernel panic when you 
log out.  From reading the posts on the apple discussion board, people 
seem to have narrowed it down to a problem with mouse settings in the 
.GlobalPreferences.plist file.  It seems that on certain hardware, 
mostly laptops, this file becomes corrupted and causes crashes.  The 
workaround was to delete this prefs file and lock the new one so that 
it couldn't be corrupted again.  The problem is, you are forced to use 
default trackpad and mouse settings, which suck...and whenever you 
restart, the locked file has to be re-locked.  I personally didn't feel 
like dealing with all that hassle, so I reverted back to 10.2.2.  The 
kernel panics are gone now.  I'm not certain whether or not Apple has 
issued a &quot;statement&quot; regarding this bug, but the people on the 
discussion board have certainly brought it to their attention.  The 
hardware I am using is an iBook 500, 10GB, DVD, with 640MB RAM.  The 
machine was bout roughly 16 months ago.  I wasn't just complaining for 
the sake of it.  I've used Mac's since I was 10 years old (about 13 
years now), and I've always liked them.  I'm just getting tired of 
&quot;fighting&quot; the PC world and tired of system &quot;updates&quot; that really 
aren't.  Hopefully this clears up what you wanted to know.
