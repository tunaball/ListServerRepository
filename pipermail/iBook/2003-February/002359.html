<PRE>The *automatic* setup software, which you download onto your
computer and let run at the software's will, is for Window$.
The procedure to set up your Mac for yourself is quite easy,
check  &lt;<A HREF="http://www.surfbest.net/technical/mac">http://www.surfbest.net/technical/mac</A>&gt;

I've set up an OS9.2.2 iMac and an OS X (10.1.4) iBook so far,
and found the instructions straightforward.  I followed the
OS9 manual--ie non-Internet Assistant--version, which I doubt
you need much Mac knowledge to do.

I talked to their tech support before signing up (to see if we
could pay eg 6-monthly to avoid the hassle of monthly bills
paying by check), and found them understanding and helpful;
and also after signing up due to some technicality stuff I
wanted to do to my own perfectionist satisfaction, and found
them still understanding and helpful.  They will talk you
through manual setup if you need the assistance.  I'd posted
for suggestions of ISP's, got several, and looked at all, and
found SurfBest the best-seeming choice from my viewpoint
(picky; computer knowledgeable but not loading a dialup ISP
with too much action; careful about security and privacy;
averse to the advertising-utopia approach; wanting lots of
numbers to use, mainly while traveling--I've got broadband
access at home and school).

Using them has not been a disappointment to me.  Using them by
some essentially naive users, including a visitor who's been
using aol because &quot;I don't know anything about computers&quot;--has
been without problems.

I should say I've not used a mail program through them, though
we've used a couple of usual web-based ones, but my guess is
their setup would work as well as any other ISP's.  Cf eg
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.surfbest.net/technical/index.htm">http://www.surfbest.net/technical/index.htm</A>&gt; has links to
email setups.

Take another look at them.
