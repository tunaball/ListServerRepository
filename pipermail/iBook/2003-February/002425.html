<PRE>First, upgrade to 10.2.3 and reinstall the lexmark.  I set my mom's 
iMac up with the same printer w/o difficulties.

If it still doesn't work, before you get totally fed up with the 
lexmark and trash it, download gimp-print from here

Follow the directions on the pdf file to install the program and the 
printer.  I assume it is connected by usb so it should be easy.

IF you still are set to trash the lexmark - I love my epson printers, 
even the stylus 3000 that has gotten very cranky in it's old age and 
keeps insisting it is out of paper when it is not.  Have an 880 at home 
that is fast and quite as a whisper.  The newer models have archival 
ink too.  MacAddict just reviewed several printers so look there for 
info too.  One ink jet did have duplex (two-side) printing, but this is 
usually found on laser jets.  If you don't need/want color printing, 
I'd put out a little more $$ ($200?) and get the brother 1450. It is 
much cheaper to print laser than ink carts.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I finally got the Jag 10.2 and installed it. My previous problem was 
</I>&gt;<i> that I couldn't get my Lexmark Z53 printer to work. So, after 
</I>&gt;<i> installing jag, I went to lexmark dot com and downloaded a driver for 
</I>&gt;<i> 10.x.x and guess what? Still didn't work. OK, so if the only driver 
</I>&gt;<i> lexmark had for v10 didn't work for 10.1.5 why would it work for 10.2? 
</I>&gt;<i> I gave up. I'm going to get a new printer. Don't even bother to 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest things to try for using the Lexmark. Ain't gonna happen, know 
</I>&gt;<i> what I mean, Vern?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So - any suggestions for a good printer under $200, that will work 
</I>&gt;<i> VERY WELL (en excellence) that is compatible for the iBook with OSX 
</I>&gt;<i> 10.2, and has the best resolution, and perhaps even waterproof inks? I 
</I>&gt;<i> was looking at Small Dog and saw one for sale, HP Deskjet 5550. Do any 
</I>&gt;<i> of you have that? If so, what do the ink cartridges cost and how much 
</I>&gt;<i> is that thingie that makes it so you can print both sides of a page 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically? I couldn't find info on the cost of these things. I'll 
</I>&gt;<i> write smalldog and ask them too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all your help,
</I>&gt;<i> Ally
</I>
</PRE>
