I had only one experience with PowerMax (a few years ago) and that is why
I&#185;ve had only one experience with PowerMax. It ended happily enough but the
company didn&#185;t make it easy and I had to get my credit card company to
withhold payment before it was resolved to my satisfaction. Just because I
had a bad experience doesn&#185;t necessarily mean the company isn&#185;t reputable,
but with so many other companies working hard to get my money I&#185;ve never
found it necessary to give PowerMax a second try. SmallDog.com gets my vote
big time. I&#185;ve bought lots of new and used stuff from them and been treated
well.

But I&#185;d be more concerned about buying a product outside of Canada. Hope
there are some Canadian folk on the list with experience. I suspect that
Apple Canada wouldn&#185;t honor the warranty but I don&#185;t know this for a fact. I
do know that when I traveled in Canada a few years ago and my power adapter
died two different Apple dealers in Ontario told me they couldn&#185;t do a
warranty replacement. I wound up buying an adapter and then utilizing my
local Apple dealer to get my money back since Apple didn&#185;t want to cover it.
