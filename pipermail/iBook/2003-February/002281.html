After a while anyone whose livelihood and income depends on their 
computer output develops the attitude of don't do anything to screw it 
up. X is quite stable but is Quark in Classic? I don't know.

One way to find out how dedicated anyone is to having this individual 
switch to X no matter what is for that individual to guarantee out of 
his wallet the lost income and cost of the switch.

Trust me on this, I have been on the bad end of THREE database crashes 
after upgrading the OS and other stuff at the customer's request and 
against MY wishes. It's a real pain in the neck to have to A) rebuild a 
thoughly screwed up database because they waited two weeks to report 
the problems B) consider moving into a new database because the present 
one they wanted to move up to is unstable C) do this under extreme 
pressure because the income and jobs of a dozen people and the home and 
possessions of the owner depend upon my being able to fix the problems.

So, with that in mind, let's not treat the reluctance of a manager to 
put his entire business at risk to satisfy someone else's whims as a 
negative thing...   :)

Unless of course you are wealthy and willing to pay for all costs in 
doing so.
