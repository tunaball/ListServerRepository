<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Peter Nacken &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">caipirina at mac.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> From what I heard it is like 150 MB for iMovie and 42 MB for iPhoto .. 
</I>&gt;<i> SIGH
</I>&gt;<i> !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>What have I told you about listening to rumours?! :)

It's 81 and 35 MB respectively.

&gt;<i> Will get it somehow :) curious what people say how they like it ... Any
</I>&gt;<i> articles about tests yet ??
</I>
I have tested both pretty thoroughly since it came out at 3pm. I'll 
keep this short since one can go on about the overall brilliance of 
these two programs indefinitely.

iPhoto - handles larger libraries much better, but still not the place 
to keep 10,000+ photos. The one-button &quot;archive to CD/DVD&quot; option saves 
CRAPLOADS of time and is a real godsend. Earlier in the day I had to 
burn two CDs of photos for somone on an iBook and it took FOREVER. Must 
have been at least a half an hour -- select photos, export photos, drag 
resulting folder to blank cd, burn cd, verify cd. Sheesh.

The Enhance button really IS magic, but I notice patterns -- it 
brightens and heightens contrast on people and near things, darks far 
and/or fuzzy things. Interesting approach that indeed will make MOST 
people's photos look better. Will drive real photographers mad. :)

The Retouch brush is TOO simple, but it does work and it is nice. 
Again, real Photoshop jockeys will loathe it. No control.

Overall a great improvement. Seems much faster to me but that could be 
the &quot;new software smell&quot; talking.

iMovie - two minutes after I opened an unfinished project in iMovie3 I 
was wondering how I had gotten along without the Ken Burns Effect for 
so long. The integration with iTunes and the new instant export to iDVD 
(the secret: all the clips are kept in DV-compatible format from the 
get-go), the new sound effects and transitions are all fabulous. 
Haven't played MUCH with the audio features except to soften some music 
in a spot where it's hard to hear the narration -- wow, how did I work 
without this feature before?? Oh yeah, I spent a lot more time in other 
programs &quot;prepping&quot; the audio! Big productivity boost.

So far, my only disappointment is that I don't have any way to export 
in MPEG-2 for SVCD use. Toast provided a plugin for VCD output, now if 
they (or Apple) would just do the same again for SVCD ...
