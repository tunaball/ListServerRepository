&lt;rant&gt;The problem you have is that the software installed on the 
machine is not legal for you to use or have without the original disks 
and serial numbers. If anything goes wrong, you are out of luck. As an 
eBay seller for almost five years, I personally think that anyone 
advertising a computer with a big list of &quot;pre-installed&quot; or &quot;trial&quot; 
copies of commercial applications needs to be kicked right off the 
site. It's software piracy, it's illegal, and it screws the 
unsuspecting buyer who thinks they got a wonderful bargain.

My suggestion is that if you really NEED those applications, you should 
pony up the cash and buy them. Anyone who can't afford high-end design 
software probably isn't working in professional publishing and doesn't 
need them anyway. You wouldn't try to run a delivery company with a 
stolen truck, you wouldn't tap into your neighbor's phone line to hook 
up a fax machine, but somehow using illicitly obtained programs is 
fine?

I realize that this isn't the advice you are looking for, but 
hopefully, people on a public email list will know better than to 
recommend software piracy.&lt;/rant&gt;

FWIW, I have shelled out considerable $$ for the programs I use - 
Office, Creative Suite Pro, BBEdit, Freehand, Font Reserve to list a 
few. I don't have any worries if something goes wrong- I can just 
reinstall from the CDs. I can also get technical support, download 
updates, etc.
