<PRE>Hi There,

When I wanted to replace the drive in my iBook, I found that a slot loader
wouldn't seem to fit. Instead I acquired a Toshiba SD-R2002 DVD/CD drive
which is a &quot;slide-out&quot; DVD-player and CD-player/writer. It just dropped
straight in to the hole in the casework; but it did require minor
modification to the plastic door to fit properly. Once (physically) fitted
the iBook just loved it with no software or other changes required --
running OSX.

In terms of RAM, mine is a G3 600 MHz iBook so it took &quot;bog standard&quot; memory
from one of the normal suppliers. Mine came with 128Mbytes on the
motherboard so a 512MByte card made it up to the maximum of 640Mbytes. Just
put &quot;iBook&quot; into the memory selection page of any reasonable preferred
supplier and let them sort things out for you.

Finally, I can recommend sticking with OSX (although I've turned off the
password requirement on my one). Once you've got the hang of it, it seems so
much better than OS9 -- but that comment is bound to start arguments.

Hope this helps

Regards
Andy, G8TQH

Subject: [iBook] Second Hand Mac woes

Hello everyone,

I am new to the list as I have just purchased a white second hand iBook 
G3 running at 500MHz. Unfortunately, the CD ROM drive doesn't appear to 
read any CDs I put in there and then there are a few other minor 
problems I am hoping some of you ay help me with.

Firstly, I would like to get an internal slot-loading combo drive to 
replace the failed drive. Can any one here provide me with more details 
on this? Perhaps someone here can suggest a model or brand. Secondly, I 
would like to install more RAM. Could someone provide me details on the 
RAM I need for this iBook? Finally, I had the mac startup from OSX, 
which was already installed on the iBook, and found myself presented 
with a login screen. I don't know the password and would like to simply 
restart the computer with OS9.

I would appreciate any help from anyone about any of these issues.

Thanks so much
Alex
