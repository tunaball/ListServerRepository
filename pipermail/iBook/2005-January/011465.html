Since you do not have the original disks for these programs you do not own
them. The official word for this is piracy. Yes, lots of people seem to have
no ethical problems with using software for which they didn't pay. We find
many of them in jails. Similarly, many people have no ethical problems with
selling computers preloaded with software and music but keeping the CDs for
themselves - just as the person who sold the computer to you. The official
word for this is also piracy. We often find these people on Ebay but also
lots of Mom and Pop computer stores; and increasingly in court as the
software police continue their crackdown on piracy.

Are the software police likely to show up at your house someday? No. But if
you are going to use this software you should pay for it. It is the right
thing to do. If you cannot afford it you obviously don't need it - if you
were a professional graphics designer the computer and software could be
written off as a business expense, as is mine. FWIW, for home use Mac:Office
can be had for under $150 and that includes a license for *3* computers.
Adobe Photoshop Elements has all the features home graphics users need and
can be bought for under $100. There are less featured and less expensive
options for Illustrator and Quark as well.

You may not think you deserve this rant but it is something that needs to be
said. Software piracy is theft whether it feels like it or not.
