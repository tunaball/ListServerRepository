<PRE>I'm really trying very hard not to say something sarcastic about your 
sermon.

OK, I won't. But you're way too hard on Kathi, who bought the computer 
not knowing it wasn't &quot;legal&quot; to use the software that was on it.

Actually I will say this. When &quot;used&quot; software is sold on &quot;used&quot; 
computers, what Microsh*t has gained is another potential customer by 
letting them use what amounts to a demo version. Eventually the 'puter 
will be replaced and/or the software upgraded and the person will have 
to purchase the software...as we see graphically illustrated in Kathi's 
dilemma.

Software companies cry in their champagne over illegal copies of their 
programs being distributed in third world countries. People there can't 
afford the US PRICES, but they are being brainwashed into believing 
it's the best and eventually they'll earn enough to buy it at prices to 
buy Bill Gates another airplane...

</I>&gt;<i> be

</I>&gt;<i> Mac:Office
</I>&gt;<i> can be had for under $150 and that includes a license for *3* 
</I>&gt;<i> computers.
</I>&gt;<i> Adobe Photoshop Elements has all the features home graphics users need 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> can be bought for under $100. There are less featured and less 
</I>&gt;<i> expensive
</I>&gt;<i> options for Illustrator and Quark as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may not think you deserve this rant but it is something that needs 
</I>&gt;<i> to be
</I>&gt;<i> said. Software piracy is theft whether it feels like it or not.
