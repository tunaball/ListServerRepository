That is always a good technique.  It's what could be referred to as 
&quot;chopping the problem in half&quot;.  In one step you eliminate all user 
settings and anything else in the user account.  It lets you quickly 
isolate things.  The step after that is to find the midpoint of the 
problem that remains and test on half or the other of it.

You can either try moving all your stuff from the old account into this 
new one, piece by piece or try disabling files in the old account.  Most 
likely the offending file is in 
/Users/your-username/Library/Preferences.  Make a folder in the above 
Library folder, call it &quot;Disabled Stuff&quot; then move the Preferences 
folder into it, log out, log back in and test the keyboard.  If the 
keyboard works, put things back the way they were, move the &quot;Disabled 
Stuff&quot; folder inside the Preferences folder then move the first half of 
the files into it and repeat the above testing process.  You keep 
repeating this moving files in and out until you narrow it down to one 
file.  You can also use the Finder's label feature (different colors) to 
flag which ones need testing, are being tested and have been tested.
