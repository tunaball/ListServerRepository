<PRE>Slightly off-topic for this iBook list but for the past three or four 
weeks, I've had problems accessing good old faithful Google 
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</A> . Whether I access it directly by URL or 
indirectly via Firefox's search block (v.2.0.013 which I've had 
forever), my HughesNet satellite connection sends me &quot;The connection 
to the server was reset while the page was loading&quot; (the status bar 
goes from &quot;looking for google.com to waiting for google.com, then 
goes to &quot;done&quot; with the above message suggesting a reload which comes 
back the same). At first, I thought it was a traffic volume issue; 
satellite internet is like that: evenings and mornings sometimes have 
traffic issues but it's been continuous for too many weeks although I 
can occasionally access Google during mid-day and later evening 
hours. On a random spot check, I can also access Google via iCab 
and/or Safari but it's sporadic and also a hassle to change browsers 
in mid-stream. There was also a problem accessing other sites during 
January and earlier February, again with my initial thought of it 
being a traffic issue on my satellite. However, the problem has 
persisted with Google.

Has Google blacklisted/blocked my ISP or Firefox IP address? Doesn't 
seem likely since I can access Google with Firefox from time to time 
with reloads, but not at all hours. Do I have a scrambled Firefox? FF 
v.3 upgrade has twice really eaten up my FF v.2xxx bookmarks, 
preferences, and everything else so, at least until I upgrade to a 
MacPro (not this year), I have no immediate plans to upgrade Firefox 
nor buy a new laptop. Again, it seems to be a time-of-day issue but I 
won't bet the farm on this, especially since Firefox tells me I've 
made contact with Google but then have been &quot;reset&quot;, hence &quot;try 
again&quot;.

Anyone else experienced a comparable problem? Or other thoughts?

Using Tiger OS 10.4.11 on 14.1&quot; iBook 900 (kinda long in the tooth, 
2003 vintage) but still working like a champ (typical of Macs - they 
last forever) albeit I can't get DiskWarrior to work on v.10.4.11... 
which might play a role here.
