The additional space is likely taken up by GarageBand and iDVD files 
which you can remove as needed. You can also trim things by removing 
unwanted languages with a utility such as Monolingual.

The question of swapping the machine out is a bit trickier. You 
essentially have three options if you need added storage.

1. Swap the machine and get the bigger hard drive. This keeps 
everything under warranty and lets you take all your storage with you 
easily, but you still have only one hard drive.
2. Keep the current iBook and buy an external Firewire (preferred) or 
USB 2.0 drive. This is an easy way to get extra space and you no longer 
have a single point of failure/loss if something goes wrong. Note that 
an iPod works beautifully both for storing that 10GB of music and as a 
backup drive, but of course is more expensive than a regular computer 
drive.
3. Buy an external case and larger notebook HD, and swap the internal 
drive into the case and the new drive into the iBook. This may void 
warranties but will likely be cheaper (and will DEFINITELY be more of a 
PITA) than the other two options.

Personally, if you have the cash, my suggestion would be to get an iPod 
for your music, separate from the decision about returning the iBook.
