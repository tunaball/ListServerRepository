<PRE>Jag ROCKS! But Panther's even better!

As far as Jag goes though I've had about 2 or 3 system crashes in 18 
months on my 400 DV iMac - and that's with the computer on and number 
crunching 24/7 !! It's a most impressive operating system.

But then, as I've said, Panther seems to be even better than Jag for 
stability, workability, speed etc. I have that on my SE Graphite 
clamshell.

I still have 9.2 on a 350 iMac here but really it's days are 
numbered. I see no point in hanging on to 9.2 much longer - though to 
be fair I still use it for a bit of number crunching as well......and 
<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">SETI at Home</A> of course :-)

Cameron.



&gt;<i>I have heard mixed reports on Jaguar for the 700mhz iBook.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I see a couple of places where I could buy it cheap (And several folks have
</I>&gt;<i>offered to send me disks, many thanks) and I know I could get a hold of it
</I>&gt;<i>one way or another, but several folk have told me to avoid Jag on the G3
</I>&gt;<i>iBooks. Many have said it slows it down, reduces the battery life, and has
</I>&gt;<i>very poor video performance. How are all of your experiences with it? People
</I>&gt;<i>keep telling me to save up and spring for Panther and don't waste my time
</I>&gt;<i>with Jag. Last time I tried OSX was the very first release and I hated it.
</I>&gt;<i>It's grown up some and matured, and I think with a new machine, I am ready
</I>&gt;<i>to try it. I know nothing about it, other then what I have read at various
</I>&gt;<i>tech forums. One thing seems constant, and that's avoid Jaguar. Is it really
</I>&gt;<i>all that bad?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am I am jittery. I honestly don't care what I use at this point. I want it
</I>&gt;<i>to arrive. Must wait for Monday for it to even ship. Longest weekend ever...
</I></PRE>
