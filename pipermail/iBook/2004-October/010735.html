I have heard mixed reports on Jaguar for the 700mhz iBook.

I see a couple of places where I could buy it cheap (And several folks have
offered to send me disks, many thanks) and I know I could get a hold of it
one way or another, but several folk have told me to avoid Jag on the G3
iBooks. Many have said it slows it down, reduces the battery life, and has
very poor video performance. How are all of your experiences with it? People
keep telling me to save up and spring for Panther and don't waste my time
with Jag. Last time I tried OSX was the very first release and I hated it.
It's grown up some and matured, and I think with a new machine, I am ready
to try it. I know nothing about it, other then what I have read at various
tech forums. One thing seems constant, and that's avoid Jaguar. Is it really
all that bad? 

I am I am jittery. I honestly don't care what I use at this point. I want it
to arrive. Must wait for Monday for it to even ship. Longest weekend ever...
