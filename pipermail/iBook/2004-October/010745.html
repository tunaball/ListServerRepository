</I>The dual USB iBook has a video out that requires a VGA dongle. The same
dongle is used for the G4 iMac and I think Apple still sells them. Email me
privately - I think I still have my spare and I'll certainly offer it for
less than Apple does.

Jag is perfectly usable but if you can afford it certainly move to Panther -
or wait a (few?) months for Tiger. As I recall it most of the complaints
about Jaguar had to do with a few updates that caused trouble or OS 9 users
who are still moaning about OS X not being just like OS 9 but better.

Battery life on a new battery should be between 2.5 and 4 hours depending on
which applications you are using, and how careful you are. I regularly got
between 2.5 and 3.5 hours and that is Jag/Panther with airport and Office
which isn't battery friendly. The battery does degrade over time - how much
depends on your usage. Some people report noticeable degradation after one
year and others report near full usage after 2+ years. Personally, I notice
a difference around 18 months and generally buy a new battery soon after.
Airport seems to shave 20-30 minute off of my use.
