The two times I sent my iBook in, I had it back in less than 48 hours. Both
times it went out on a Monday afternoon and came back Wednesday morning.

One other thing comes to mind regarding your antenna. I recently help a
client, Paul, get set up with his new 17&quot; PowerBook &lt;green with envy&gt;. We
couldn't get it to work properly with his AirPort express, so he went back
to the Apple Store with it where, of course, it functioned perfectly!!!???
When he tried to use it again at home...NOTHING.

So Paul called Apple tech support, tried a number of troubleshooting steps
and got nothing. After a pregnant pause the guy at Apple suddenly asked Paul
&quot;are you calling from a cordless phone?&quot;. As it turned out, yes, he was, the
one on his desk. Paul promptly pulled the plug on the cordless and his
AirPort started working again! Of course he'd cut himself off from Apple
tech support &lt;duh&gt; but everything was working fine.

To solve his problem, and still allow the use of the phone, he simply
changed the channel on the AirPort Express.

Not sure if this helps you, but you never know.
