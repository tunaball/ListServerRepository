That's actually very helpful. Thank you. 

Most of what I read about Jag is as follows. With the G3 finder response is glacially slow at times. In some applications there is typing lag. A general feeling of sluggishness. It's CPU intensive, which eats the battery a bit. Memory management is not as good as it could be so it accesses the hard drive a good bit then it needs to. (I hear Panther fixes this, is that true?) These seem to be the general gist of the serious complaints. There are lots of personal beefs as well, and yes, many are from the die hard &quot;OS9er is so much finer&quot; crowd. 

But hearing about 100+ days of uptime... For all the griping and complaining, very few people mention the perks, unless they are trying to convert somebody from Windows. When talking to a fellow Mac user, there is generally nothing good to say because most folks assume said Mac user already knows. I have heard very little of the perks and would love to hear more. 

I will confess, I hesitate to upgrade to a new OS. Every time I have done so I have suffered somehow. Upgrading to System 7... Ouch. Some updates helped, others hurt. System 7.5... Double ouch. Updating to OS8. Ew. Eeew. Lots of eye candy, looked great... But issues. OS8.1 fixed most of my gripes. 8.5 and later 8.6 where just about the only instance I can't recall being injured in migration. OS9 had some hiccups I was none to pleased with. But I upgraded and tweaked my system to where it is rock solid and stable as can be. (Or was, before my iMac started going down hill.) I am wary of OSX. Is more then an expansion of the old OS, it's an evolution. And I am most likely biased. The first version of OSX drove me away. I just hated it. 

I am starting to see things I like, things that I had always wished had been there. I just hope that it finally feels somewhat &quot;Maclike.&quot;
