</I>Ayah? Compared to what? OS 9 diehards who have nothing good to say about any

and I've installed it on machines as old as the original iMac and iBook.

</I>
Again, compared to what, OS 9? The simple truth is OS X feels and looks less
snappy when compared to OS 9. It is also true that OS X boots slower than OS
9 but it is also tons more stable than OS 9. One day I noticed my uptime Jag
on the iBook was close to 90 days so out of cussedness and curiosity I
bypassed a security update and a Jag update so I wouldn't have to restart.
Finally gave in at 101 days. Given that kind of stability who cares if it
boots slower? And yes, battery life with OS X hasn't reached OS 9 standards
but I can't say it made that huge a difference for me.

&gt;<i> People
</I>&gt;<i> keep telling me to save up and spring for Panther and don't waste my time
</I>&gt;<i> with Jag. Last time I tried OSX was the very first release and I hated it.
</I>&gt;<i> It's grown up some and matured, and I think with a new machine, I am ready

</I>&gt;<i> tech forums. One thing seems constant, and that's avoid Jaguar. Is it really
</I>&gt;<i> all that bad? 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I really don't know where you are reading that Jaguar is bad. It isn't. I
repeat - it was the first stable and really usable version of OS X. If you
can afford Panther, sure, go for it. But if you can't, get Jag by all means.
