</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  My first Mac was a clamshell 300 MHz with 6 gig RAM. It was fun to use.
</I>
6GB hard drive, you mean? My Blueberry came stock with a 3.2GB drive. It's got 
a 30GB Fujitsu notebook drive in it now. It also has a full 544MB RAM: 512 in 
the slot, 32 on the logic board. It was fun to use it in the stock 
configuration, but it's way more fun running it now. ^_^

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do need some assistance though. It's got 7.6 GB's  left on it. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I were to take O.S. 9 off would it free up those GB's ?, &amp; too is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it advisable to remove this O.S. ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  You will not gain much space at all removing OS 9. Leave it there.
</I>&gt;<i>  The best thing to do is make sure you have the maximum amount of
</I>&gt;<i> RAM. If you do, then Panther should run fine. Before I sold my
</I>&gt;<i> clamshell I had it running 10.2 (Jaguar) really well.

Panther is very happy under my current specs. I have heard tell that Tiger is 
also quite speedy on an older machine using either X Post Facto or doing the 
installer disk remastering trick. The only thing stopping Tiger from 
installing on New World Macs that don't have firewire is a little .plist 
which has the forbidden system IDs in it. I'm sticking with Panther though, 
because it seems to be more stable than Tiger on the low end, and it's 
compatible with almost everything I need to run on it. Well, almost 
everything. Curse Google Maps and its insistence on running under Tiger! Bah!

Anyway, I could use installing 9 on my Blueberry...that would mean I could run 
the original version of Unreal Tournament for Mac. There is no 3D 
acceleration for the video system in the 300MHz iBook under X...it has the 
dreaded Rage Pro 4MB chip. But however, if you run UT while booted up in 9, 
you get ATI Rave Acceleration, which the Mac OS 9 version was written to take 
advantage of. It would have a choppy frame rate and you'd have to run it at 
640 x 480, but it would run. I've seen it done on a Beige before. However, 
once you get your system installed and working &quot;just so&quot; it's a drag to have 
to go in and reinstall. Leave 9 where it is.
