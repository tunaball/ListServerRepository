<PRE>Actually, this is a graphite iBook. I purchased it from a friend, who had used it for several years for schoolwork, before upgrading to a PowerBook G4. It saw a rough life, with several of the keys breaking before a replacement keyboard was purchased (unfortunately, a key still managed to get broken off of the new one). The bezel snapped off the end of the drive not too long before the iBook was taken out of service, and it's tabs are still attached; unfortunately, the bezel is all but gone forever, according to the previous owner. I'm still not sure whether or not the bezel has any real hand in the drive latching shut, and knowing that it's latched shut (simply holding the drive mechanism closed has no effect). Any ideas?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hello everyone. I recently acquired an iBook SE G3/466. Unfortunately, the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;tray-loading DVD-ROM drive is missing it's plastic bezel, and refuses to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;latch shut. Might there be a way to repair the latching mechanism? Also, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the 'F' key is missing; might anyone happen to have an old keyboard with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that key intact? Thanks in advance.

</I>&gt;<i> Adam, sounds like maybe you got the Indigo iBook I traded to PowerMax for 
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;Snow&quot; iBook; mine had the problem with the plastic bezel. I was able 
</I>&gt;<i> to achieve a temp repair with a tiny bit of Super Glue (suggested by a 
</I>&gt;<i> staff member at a Genius Bar which I won't identify further). The real 
</I>&gt;<i> problem with this kind of repair is that the mating surfaces to be glued 
</I>&gt;<i> are so tiny they won't hold. It didn't have a problem with the &quot;F&quot; key, 
</I>&gt;<i> though, so maybe it isn't ours...
