<PRE>I ordered it Tuesday night, May 16, it showed up this morning  
(Thursday, May 18) before 11.
Here's the out of box experience. Assistance by Lilly and Tinker.

My old iBook was cloned to my firewire drive, and I hooked the Maxtor  
up to the MacBook as instructed by the set up assistant. It copied  
all my stuff over, but all my old mail didn't seem to copy over  
right. Guess I'll try to manually restore it.

I got a lot of this:

&gt;<i> The message from <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">ibook-request at listserver.themacintoshguy.com</A>  
</I>&gt;<i> concerning &#8220;iBook Digest, Vol 21, Issue 6&#8221; has not been downloaded  
</I>&gt;<i> from the server. You need to take this account online in order to  
</I>&gt;<i> download it.
</I>
Of course I was online, the messages just weren't there.

It's great to be portable again after being tethered to an old Mac  
for almost 6 weeks.
