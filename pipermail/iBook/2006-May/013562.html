<PRE>Joy, I'd like to offer just a little ray of hope for his iBook. I had a problem with my 900 G3 iBook (new Aug 03) last month in which it would boot up to the whirling gear, but as it was going to the blue screen, it would shut itself off. It wouldn't even open Disk Warrior as a boot CD. I ran the hardware check CD that came with the computer and it said everything was OK, hardware-wise, but I wasn't convinced. With visions of having to buy a new iBook or PowerBook, I phoned Apple Tech Support (paid version) and determined the problem was in the system software. I reinstalled Tiger and it's been working fine since, albeit a little lost data since I didn't back up to my external HD as often as I should have. So maybe, just maybe it's &quot;only&quot; a system problem.

That &quot;pop&quot; in his iBook bothers me, however.
