<PRE>Just a note to recognize a kindness. Brian was good enough to answer my 
call for help &amp; offered to charge the batteries if I shipped them to 
him. He charged both of them &amp; shipped them back to me. I now have two 
functional batteries to replace the dead ones I had before. I don't 
know if this type of thing happens in the Windoze world, but it's great 
to know we Mac people look out for each other.

Admit nothing.
Deny everything.
Make counter accusations.
