<PRE>Been using broadband since 1999. Started with Cable Modem, switched DSL 
(when I moved), then back to Cable after another move. I use a dialup 
connection once in a blue moon when the broadband service is down for a 
bit. But I could never go back permanently now. I'm way too spoiled. 
:<i>-)
</I>
I pay $45 a month for cable modem and have been thinking about 
switching to DSL to take advantage of the lower cost plans DSL 
providers are offering. But, much to my amazement, I got a message from 
Comcast the other day telling me that they are doubling my bandwidth. I 
reset my modem and did a speed test. Sure enough: 3mb download; 245k 
upload. Guess I'll stay put for a while.

If you can afford it, get it. You'll be glad you did. Keeping your 
dialup until things are switched over is a good idea. Sometimes a new 
connection can take a few days to work out the kinks.
