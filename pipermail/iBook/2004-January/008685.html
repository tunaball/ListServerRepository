That was singularly unhelpful. I meant - what changed about the ibook 
line?

If anybody thinks this is just too stupid a question to answer, could 
you just ignore it please and let someone answer it who is kind enough 
to pretend it is a reasonable question?

I bought my ibook in December 2002 and had problem after problem - got 
it replaced and had - problem after problem- got THAT one replaced and 
the one they gave me (off the shelf in the apple store) had a logic 
board problem within the first HOUR I owned it. Then I got this one - 
it is a 900 mhz instead of an 800, that's the only difference I can see 
(bigger hard drive, too, I think).  But IT has also had a logic board 
problem already - I've only had it a few months.

So - what happened in April 2003 that would have Apple NOT providing 
this special repair program for computers made after that date?

Considering I've already HAD the problem with my computer, which was 
made after that date, I'm wondering why it is being excluded? What 
makes the later computers different? Do they not have the same logic 
boards?
