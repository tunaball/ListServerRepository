<PRE>--- You wrote:
I know that they do not cover batteries, at least not for the full AppleCare
period.  My Clamshell iBook is still under warranty until April and I called
them about my battery last week.  They told me that the battery is a wear and
tear item.  I wish I could remember the cut off for considering the battery
faulty, but I'm sure it was less than a year that they told me.  Anyhow, I
argued with them because this cutoff specific to batteries is not listed
anywhere in my AppleCare agreement, but to no avail.
	On another note, when I called them back to order a new battery, I was
told that they no longer carry batteries for the clamshell iBooks, and just
gave me the URLs for some third party sources.

Really, if I remember correctly, I had the battery replaced for my iceBook
during my 2nd year of the warranty, under applecare....  But I may be mistaken,
anyone else know for sure?
