<PRE>I have the Canon lide 80 scanner, and have been very happy.  It was 
reasonable priced, and has worked well.  I use it to scan images for a 
variety of medias for use on both the web and in print.

As far as the printer/copier/fax thing goes, I have always steered 
clear of the multi-function units.  I know this concern has already 
been expresses, but when one part of it breaks, you  are essentially 
stuck with buying a whole new unit.  Plus, it seems that they never 
function quite as well as the individual components.  I would recommend 
  buying a scanner, an printer, and a fax machine.  I bought a Panasonic 
fax for under $50 (on sale) that uses plain paper and also serves as a 
copier machine.  Additionally, most scanners (including the canon) can 
be configured to copy, which comes in handy with odd shaped documents 
that won't feed through the fax.  Essentially, it scans the item, and 
prints it on printer (separate component, not a multi-funciton 
thingamabob)


Hoe that helps!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can these requirements be achieved in a printer that is smaller, that

</I>&gt;<i> aesthetic as well as functional?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OR how about a combo of two units:  a slim scanner and a multi function
</I>&gt;<i> printer that could print, copy and fax, but not scan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking maybe the canon lide 80.  It is slim and os 10.3 
</I>&gt;<i> compatable.
</I>&gt;<i> Its lid extends, for scanning books. It comes w Adobe photoshop

</I>&gt;<i> .... which I am guessing (I haven't used any of this  software )  
</I>&gt;<i> might help
</I>&gt;<i> in creating a future newsletter, working with digital photos (a digital
</I>&gt;<i> camera, entry level, is maybe coming from his dad ...just 2mpx, 
</I>&gt;<i> enough, i
</I>&gt;<i> understand for newsletters, but ONE day there will be a better camera, 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe
</I>&gt;<i> an underwater camera).
</I>&gt;<i> (He will also be creating a webpage... (with help) ...  I could

</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> this area.... quality needs and maybe this scanner would be better 
</I>&gt;<i> quality
</I>&gt;<i> than  a low end multi function printer w scanner included?)
</I>&gt;<i> The canon lide looks like it would do the work,  take up little space, 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> look good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then is there a multi function smaller, aesthetic printer to print,
</I>&gt;<i> copy, and FAX to complete the needed functions and fit all the other
</I>&gt;<i> requirements?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's pretty much as far as I got in thinking this through (sorry for 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> length, but I wanted to give you the full scenario), and now I am 
</I>&gt;<i> hoping
</I>&gt;<i> that some of you will have some suggestions, strategies...  I want to
