<PRE>*** Power adapter got so hot I could've fried an egg on it if it was a bit
bigger, iBook went on battery supply, found a third party adapter even
smaller than Apples just to find out the battery doesn't charge anymore. Its
icon changes when going from power supply to battery and back but shows
&quot;Calculating...&quot; whenever the power supply is connected. Resetting the iBook
and the battery didn't help.

Ofcourse, this happens 6 days on the wrong side of the guarantee and is
going to be the second battery in 1 year and 6 days.

I'm confident it's the battery that's gone because the power manager works
(iBook is going to sleep and stuff) and the system recognizes when the PS is
connected.

Did I hear somebody ask why I didn't take Apple Care!? Another result of
this country being a buttfuck nowhere concerning hitech stuff: I waited
until two months before the expire date to buy Apple Care and couldn't find
any on stock. I was supposed to receive it in December. Only thing I got was
a mail they wouldn't have it on stock before February. It was too late to
order at Apple. Initially I didn't order at Apple Store France because it
was $80 more expensive than in the shop. France is a nice country but it's a
hell for doing business!

Now I'm thinking about exchanging my G3 iBook for a G4 12&quot; model by adding
$500. It sounds interesting.

Anyway, back to everyday life...

Zoran.
