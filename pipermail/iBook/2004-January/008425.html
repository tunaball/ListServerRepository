<PRE>Well, I've resolved it.

It was diagnosed as logic board failure, though the machine tended to 
boot for the technician. It will boot in target disk mode according to 
him, also. I was quoted $475 for part and $60 to install. $530. 
Information here was very high probability of the fix not succeeding 
long term. Information on another discussion group (not iBook specific) 
was it had a high, but far from perfect (about 85%) probability of 
succeeding. My own reading had me feeling a bit lower than 85%, but not 
as pessimistic. I decided that my best estimate of the fix succeeding 
was 50%. Not great.

So, I decided to spring for a new G4 iBook. Purchased it yesterday. 12 
inch, 800 Mhz, lovely machine. $999 at educational discount. That price 
seemed to be the best solution given an estimate of only 50% for the 
fix succeeding on the old machine.

Over the next few days I'll be connecting the old machine to the new 
one to offload various files.
