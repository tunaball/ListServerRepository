<PRE>-----Original Message-----
From: iBook List [mailto:<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">ibook at lists.themacintoshguy.com</A>] On Behalf Of
Jill Whenmouth
Subject: [P1] Requesting advice choosing a printer, etc


He will need a printer, and he will need to fax, copy (not lots of
multiple copies, just the ocassional copy), and scan.
The scan function can't be sheet fed.  (will scan diving magazines,
books, and diving photos - figure a newsletter in the future).
Low budget: (inkjet is fine). Compatable w OS10.3 (because he will get
to 10.3 inevitably).  Run quietly  (late night work in proximity to
sleeping wife ).  Ink replacement costs are always an issue to be wary
of.
My first thought was to get one of the multi-function printers, but some
of them are monstrously big, and 1. he doesn't have the space and 2.
they look so unaesthetic, esp next to the small ibook.
Can these requirements be achieved in a printer that is smaller, that is
aesthetic as well as functional?
OR how about a combo of two units:  a slim scanner and a multi function
printer that could print, copy and fax, but not scan.
--

Short summary answer:
1. You get what you pay for (inexpensive printers &amp; multi-function units
cost a bloody fortune in ink consumables).
2. Big is ugly but costs less. Small is dainty but costs more. The
all-in-one that works properly, looks great in a small package and
doesn't hurt the wallet hasn't been invented yet. They all make noise
when they print; the HP, Xerok and Brother all-in-one I've used are
noisy enough to wake his sleeping wife. 

That being said...

If you're willing to put up with the restrictions of OS X based fax
software (including the drive space the stuff gobbles to store incoming
and outgoing faxes), you could use the iBook's internal faxmodem for fax
purposes. The Canon LIDE scanner is a nice little scanner and it will do
the trick for the purposes you look at (scans for self-published print
and e-newsletters). And finally, if his printing is only occasional (and
these days, there are more and more transactions taking place
electronically via email or e-commerce web sites), he can get a nice
little Canon inkjet that will not look like hell next to his iBook. Plus
the Canons have separate ink wells, which makes them a little bit more
efficient with the consumables.

On the other hand...

If he wants to be efficient with his business, a small sheet-fed fax, a
small HP or Lexmark laser printer and a nice, small compact desk to
accommodate it all will let him work faster and better. And if you look
at a clean, used laser, it won't even cost much.

Something to think about. Happy device hunting.
