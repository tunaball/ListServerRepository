<PRE>I would recommend against removing live swapfiles, as you stand a good 
chance of hosing your system.

If you have disabled swap on a file, you can safely delete it, because 
OS X will remove any live swapped data from them.  However, as far as I 
have been able to determine, OS X does not come with an application (be 
it command-line or GUI-based) to disable a swap file to allow for this.

Another good solution, one that has been around since the NeXT days, is 
to just reboot when your swap files grow too large. :)
