<PRE>I just thought I'd let the community know the solution to the clamshell 
video out problem:
   After further testing, I found that if I rebooted the computer with 
the video out cable plugged in, the display prefs did give me the NTSC 
option and video out did work.  However if the computer is booted 
without the cable plugged in, the video out will not work.  I called 
Apple to find out if this is a known issue.  Apparently it is &quot;normal&quot;. 
  The tech I spoke to said that that port is NOT hot pluggable, and it 
shouldn't have worked the way that it did in the past.  Supposedly the 
10.2.8 update &quot;fixed&quot; this, and now it won't be as hard on the 
hardware.  He said I should be shutting the iBook off to plug in that 
cable... Whatever.  Anyhow, I'm happy as long as I can get it to work.  
Rebooting is a pain because it takes so long on this iBook, but I found 
that all I have to do is put it to sleep and plug the cable in.  When 
it wakes up, I have video out capability.  Problem solved (kind of).  
It doesn't work the way it used to, but It still works.
Dave.


&gt;<i> I'll check closer when I get home tonight.  I know that the first time 
</I>&gt;<i> I had this problem I did try changing the color depth from Millions to 
</I>&gt;<i> Thousands with no benefit.  After repeating the recent update, I just 
</I>&gt;<i> tried plugging in the video out cord to test it.  There was no effect, 
</I>&gt;<i> so I assumed it was the same problem.  Before the update, I would see 
</I>&gt;<i> the screen change resolutions as soon as the video out cable was 
</I>&gt;<i> inserted.  If the Displays preference panel was open, the list would 
</I>&gt;<i> immediately update to show the NTSC and PAL choices.  No manual 
</I>&gt;<i> changes in depth were necessary.  Something has definitely changed.
</I>&gt;<i> Dave.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm running 10.2.8 on my Clamshell and it works fine with video out.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Check your resolutions. It will not show PAL or NTSC with &quot;Millions&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selected.
