<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> .I just got my iBook today, and I noticed the same ring around the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> headphone jack as there was on the first gen iPod...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this for Apple's pro speakers?
</I>
It's because it is the same exact connector as the iPod, 1st and 2nd 
gen. the 2nd gen has a slight difference in design but it is the same 
connector. As a matter of fact, I routinely use the ipod earbuds to 
listen to my ibook when I am using the DVD player for a movie. I have 
even used the earbuds with the internal mic for ichat av quite 
successfully when I misplace my regular headset. I even use the headset 
from my cordless land phone for ichat.

The pro speakers are a unique type of connector that contains a means 
to power the speakers as a substitute for an amplifier and that is why 
they are incompatible with all but a very select set of Macs. You can 
get the soundsticks which are usb connectors and use those with all 
macs but the pro speakers are only compatible with the pmacs that start 
with the digital audio G4. I don't remember for sure if they can be 
used after the Quicksilvers.

In most respects if you can use a usb or other type of connector, I 
suggest avoiding the pro speakers unless you get the ifire extension. 
The speakers are some of the best I have heard especially for the price 
and size. However, the cable is usually too short if you have the tower 
on the floor and causes a bend in the very small and delicate tip. The 
quicksilver towers also have another problem associated with these 
speakers. The connector is on the part of the tower that is connected 
to the side door that drops down when opened. If you forget to unplug 
the speakers before dropping the door, you will put a severe bend in 
the tip. If you forget more than a few times, you will still be able to 
straigthen it enough to work but the next time you forget, it breaks 
inside the connection and you lose your audio output until you get the 
tip removed.

One other point on these speakers, they ship with a cover over the 
floating diaphragm. Since it is clear and very esthetically blended 
into the design of the speakers, most people think it is an integral 
part of the speaker and leave it in place but according to HK, the mfg, 
for best sound quality, the cover should come off when in use and go 
back on as protection when not in use.

Hope 2004 is the best ever for everyone.
