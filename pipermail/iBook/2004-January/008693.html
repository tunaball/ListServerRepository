<PRE>&gt;<i> but if you try to load a RAM and CPU hungry application (I
</I>&gt;<i> ran Photoshop 7 on the aforementionned clamshell), you'll see some
</I>&gt;<i> impact on screen redraws, windows opening and that sort of thing.
</I>
That was not a problem with the computer and os X. That was a problem 
with the meager amt of VRAM in the clamshell. When the first version of 
10.0 came out, I loaded it AND os 9 on my blueberry 300 using 160 MB of 
RAM and was able to run it using netscape, or IE plus X mail,  and 
address book with no problems. I don't remember if I tried to run 
Photoshop 4 on it which was the highest version i had then or not.

When I use a web browser, I usually have many pages open simultaneously 
and I didn't have any more problems with it than I did with os 9. I 
recently got 256 mb RAM for it and before I install that, I will 
install jaguar and os 9 on it and see what happens, then compare it 
with the 256 and report back. It may take a while, some other things 
have more priority right now.

The bottom line is your expectations and needs will be more influential 
in your success than the hardware. If you plan to run the latest 
versions of software that require lots of VRAM and fast refresh rates, 
you will be unhappy. If your goal is to have a chance to play with all 
the neat new stuff in X and you are running either &quot;normal&quot; X native 
apps or older versions of resource demanding apps, you should be happy.

Important hints to make your experiment happier:

1. RAM lots and lots of RAM to substitute for the hardware deficits. 
The RAM you buy for it will also transfer to the G3 dual ibooks so it 
is not a lost investment. If you get more than 160 mbs and you REALLY 
SHOULD, (get the 512 if you are going to keep the ibook even if you go 
back to 9 you will still love the RAM) apply the firmware update first, 
then install the new RAM. If you don't, the extra RAM will not be seen 
by the ibook

2. ALWAYS run your older software using classic from X. NEVER boot from 
9 to run the older stuff. There is very little old stuff that will 
still run using classic (as an experiment, I ran AppleWorks 2.1, 
Macpaint, MacWrite and a few other oldies on my dual ibook booted from 
jaguar. I even ran a app that was written to be run on os 6). Booting 
from 9 will cause you system grief. XLR8YOURMAC and Mac OS X hints have 
some tips for slimming down the system 9 folder to help save drive 
space.

3. Spiffy new action games will be out of your league with the meager 
VRAM and cpu speed. But you will be able to use it for some of the less 
intense strategy games for X
