&gt;<i>I've been thinking about switching to dsl - at work too much since it is a 
</I>&gt;<i>fast connection. Earthlink dsl is $50 per month (now paying $23? for dial-up). 
</I>&gt;<i>I heard about SBC (aka ameritech/ ma bell) which is my current phone service, 
</I>&gt;<i>from someone at work.  DSL with them and Yahoo is only $27 per month - just a 
</I>&gt;<i>hair over what I am payiing for my slow modem connection. Plus you get a $99 
</I>&gt;<i>rebate which for the first year brings it down to $18 per month.  For that low 
</I>&gt;<i>price I could even afford to run both for a month to get everything switched 
</I>&gt;<i>over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyone have any experience with this?
</I>
I've had it, gosh, it's been 4-1/2 years now; I think I was one of the 1st, at 
least in my neighborhood and maybe even in a wider area of LA. Since I signed 
up so early I got static IP.

Only problem I had was last spring when someone noticed I had static IP but was 
only paying for standard service, so they tried to switch me over.. For 2 weeks 
nothing could get PPoE to work; if I hadn't had my beloved iBook I would have 
been totally stuck because my 7300's external modem went bye-bye when I got the 
DSL. SBC finally gave up and had me contact their contractor in charge of their 
wiring. They couldn't figure it, either, and they finally kicked it up to one 
of their Top Geeks, who discovered that my DSL modem was somehow hardwired to a 
static IP and he decided that rather than dealing with that issue, he just 
reset my account to static IP.

WOO HOO!!

I don't really know what the advantage of static IP over dynamic IP is; I just 
know it's considered enough better that people pay extra to get it, so I brag 
about it.
