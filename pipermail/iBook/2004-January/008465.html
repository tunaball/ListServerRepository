I'm on my forth logic board (three failures) in 2 years.  I believe
the last failure was caused by stress applied to the logic board by
the way I was carrying it.  I had the lid open and had it in one hand
like a dinner plate (thumb on top right corner, fingers supporting
botton).  I was walking around with it checking the wireless signal
strength at different locations in the house when the screen went
to vertical bars.  A reboot fixed it, but over the next few days
it would freak out on me on an increasingly frequent basis.  I found
that a slight tap/slap on the lower left corner would occasionally
bring it back to life without having to reboot.  But this worked less
and less often until eventually even a reboot would not fix it.

The distressing part was that I was away on vacation when this happened.
Luckily I was able to borrow time on my sister's iMac during the rest
of my visit.
