<PRE>Do you see a reason not to just stick a clean piece of paper over the 
keyboard before closing the iBook?

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm almost ready to buy a new iBook. Are there any models--the newest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ones, perhaps??--that don't have the problems mentioned with warping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and/or screen marks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have listened to all the discussion on this list about these two 
</I>&gt;<i> issues and finally dedicded to share the results of my research, 
</I>&gt;<i> opinions and experience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everything about the iBook is as small, as thin and as lightweight as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible. Everything about the iBook is carefully designed to be as 
</I>&gt;<i> stylish as possible and to let the mechanical stuff be as invisible as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible. There are some consequences with all these restrictions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Warp issue&#8212;in line with keeping the mechanics invisible, we have 
</I>&gt;<i> the matter of the latch. I suspect space problems required the 
</I>&gt;<i> redesign of the hinge and latch. The Clamshell was my favorite but I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> sure it took more room to make it work successfully. The design of the 
</I>&gt;<i> TiBook hinge (which preceeded the iBook) was  discarded because of 
</I>&gt;<i> some design flaws with it and because of the smaller size of the 
</I>&gt;<i> iBook. The ibook hinge gives us full use of the screen and a sense of 
</I>&gt;<i> roominess that we would not get if the screen sat on top of the 
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard and it would also mean we might have to give up the speakers 
</I>&gt;<i> or put up with less ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the matter out of the way, there is till how do we firmly close 
</I>&gt;<i> the thing and make sure that it signals the processor to go to sleep? 
</I>&gt;<i> The pre TiBook and iBook generations had a very firm, large, &quot;normal&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> metal tongue and latch device. They also had much thicker, heavier and 
</I>&gt;<i> metal enclosures and frames. Once the die was cast, the edge was true 
</I>&gt;<i> (pardon the die pun). The iBook didn't have any of these options so a 
</I>&gt;<i> new design was needed and it was kept in line with the rest of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lightness &quot; of the ibook design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A tiny, firm piece of metal (tongue) fits into the latch and locks in 
</I>&gt;<i> place. So far just like the old PBs. But they had the tongue 
</I>&gt;<i> permanently protruding and visible, The iBook tongue is invisible when 
</I>&gt;<i> the lid is open. As it closes, gravity gently eases the tongue out and 
</I>&gt;<i> down, When it gets close to the latch slot, a magnet gently eases it 
</I>&gt;<i> down and &quot;sucks&quot; it into the latch securing it and closing the circuit 
</I>&gt;<i> to be sure the cpu stays asleep.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, the lid weighs more than the little tongue and the magnet 
</I>&gt;<i> maintains a certain amount of tension on the tongue to keep it 
</I>&gt;<i> securely latched. The lid exerts a slight weight tension in the 
</I>&gt;<i> direction of &quot;open&quot; and the magnet exerts an opposing tension towards 
</I>&gt;<i> keeping it closed&#8212;balance and counter balanced, opposing and 
</I>&gt;<i> counteropposing forces. Except the weight of the lid wins a tiny bit 
</I>&gt;<i> more in this contest because the tongue is in the middle and there are 
</I>&gt;<i> no equalizing forces or latches to hold in the weight on the free 
</I>&gt;<i> edges. Voila! a slight variation between the  air space at the edge 
</I>&gt;<i> and in the middle. Optical illusion further magnifies the difference 
</I>&gt;<i> and makes it look like warping. If you put a level on all edges of the 
</I>&gt;<i> lid, there is no warpage. They are still true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The close tolerance and spacing between the lid and the keyboard 
</I>&gt;<i> creates another problem&#8212;The screen bezel rests on the keys. This 
</I>&gt;<i> actually is two problems. Oil marks on the screen and scratch marks on 
</I>&gt;<i> the bezel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you use the keyboard, the keys pick up a thin film of whatever is 
</I>&gt;<i> on your fingers and there will always be a thin film of oil on even 
</I>&gt;<i> the squeekiest clean fingers. If you are like me and many other 
</I>&gt;<i> computer users, you drink and eat around your computer and you never 
</I>&gt;<i> wash your hands each and every time you plan to use the keyboard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the lid is closed, all this grime and oil transfers to the screen 
</I>&gt;<i> if the lid closes really tight and there is NO AIR SPACE AT THE EDGES 
</I>&gt;<i> to keep a margin of separation between the keys and the screen and 
</I>&gt;<i> bezel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Screen Marks Solution: Pick your choice
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Wash your hands each time you are using the keyboard and do not 
</I>&gt;<i> touch anything but the keyboard without re-washing.  Not practical and 
</I>&gt;<i> nobody would do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Clean the keyboard everytime it is used and just before closing the 
</I>&gt;<i> lid (each time the lid is closed even for a few seconds), Better but 
</I>&gt;<i> who would remember to do it for the few seconds the lid is closed to 
</I>&gt;<i> sleep it while you get the phone or similar tasks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.Clean the keyboard everytime it is used AND use a CLEAN intervening 
</I>&gt;<i> material between the screen and the keyboard&#8212;BEST SOLUTION but also 
</I>&gt;<i> not always practical or remembered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. BEST COMPROMISE&#8212;Keep a CLEAN material handy to put on the keyboard 
</I>&gt;<i> EVERY TIME you close the computer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bezel Scratches Solution:
</I>&gt;<i> Placing material on the keyboard large enough to cover the entire 
</I>&gt;<i> surface prevents the bezel and keys from contacting and scratching 
</I>&gt;<i> each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wash the material frequently in a non oily soap and don't use and 
</I>&gt;<i> fabric softners on it, they may contain a light oily substance that is 
</I>&gt;<i> transferred to the material. Many of the commercial products sold are 
</I>&gt;<i> made from a specially processed leather which is great as far as it 
</I>&gt;<i> goes. The problem is the leather gets thrown around and handled and 
</I>&gt;<i> never washed so it will eventually pick up enough oils or substances 
</I>&gt;<i> to stain or etch the screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The company that makes the screen cleaner for Apple also makes 
</I>&gt;<i> disposable cleaning cloths that can be used as screen protectors also. 
</I>&gt;<i> They als make a microfiber cloth that can be used as a cleaning or 
</I>&gt;<i> protecting material. It is also washable so it can be kept oil and 
</I>&gt;<i> soil free. There are also other companies that make similar items. In 
</I>&gt;<i> a pinch a very soft paper towel or clean sheet of paper will solve the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem. The piece of foam that was on the keyboard when you opened 
</I>&gt;<i> the box is an excellent  option if you wash it frequently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One final caveat from personal experience:
</I>&gt;<i> When you pack your laptop (any and ALL kinds of laptops) in a case, 
</I>&gt;<i> NEVER pack irregular shaped objects next to the screen. Always pack 
</I>&gt;<i> something firm and flat next to the screen, ie, a magazine, a legal 
</I>&gt;<i> pad, etc. Never over pack the case. If you place a hub, a 
</I>&gt;<i> surgeprotector, a mouse, etc next to the screen and then you also 
</I>&gt;<i> overpack the bag, it becomes possible for the irregular shape to press 
</I>&gt;<i> unevenly on the screen and break the TFT layer&#8212;expensive repair.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I lucked out and even though I had overpacked because I made sure no 
</I>&gt;<i> objects could create pressure points, I didn't have any problems. A 
</I>&gt;<i> friend of mine on the same trip wasn't as lucky and lost his screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you already have indelible screen marks and they interfere with  
</I>&gt;<i> your use of the ibook, MacResQ.com has perfected a method of removing 
</I>&gt;<i> the polarizer layer which contains the stains and then restoring the 
</I>&gt;<i> polarizer for $299 which includes shipping costs.
