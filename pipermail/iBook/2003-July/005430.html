<PRE>Joe, Jack and Peter,

She burned a second CD for me using the 'standard' method that Roxio 
said could be read by nearly all PC's and when I inserted it in my CD 
drive, my computer whirred for a little time and nothing showed up.  I 
did a search from within Word for it and never did find it...we spent 
about an hour on it and then gave up.  I don't think she did close it, 
tho'...could that be the problem?  Her Gateway did see it and showed 
the files on it.

I'm afraid I lost ground on this little show!  Any thoughts about why 
my iBook didn't see the disk?

I'm not too confident that she really knows much about burning, but I 
sure don't know how to use her computer!

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks, guys,

Pat
