Apparently, the projector was also having issues. She's not the most tech

fsck was fine. Tried TechTool Pro. It crashed when trying to test the video
ram. Since then, it's just gotten worse. She's feeling really guilty and
since she isn't working right now, she's going to take it to the Apple
dealer and have them monkey with it.

I was hoping there was some quick fix. I really don't want to reinstall all
of the system, and the updates. That always ends up taking the better part
of an afternoon when all is said and done.

Thanks for the excellent suggestions which I will keep on hand if she has no
luck.
