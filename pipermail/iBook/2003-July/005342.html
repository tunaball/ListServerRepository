Sounds like your video drivers, and there are several hundred thousand 
of them in OS X, might have become corrupted. Your friend might have 
avoided saying, Oh yeah, there was a flash of sparks and smoke during 
the demo...just joking of course. More like the connector cord was 
pulled before the units were turned off.

So, you can run Diskwarrior, fsck, etc. and see if repairing the 
directory fixes the problems...assuming the screen will let you.

Or, grab your install disk and reinstall your system. It would of 
course be easier to just install the video drivers, for instance drag 
copying them via Firewire disk mode from another iBook but I would 
wonder if there would be permission problems.

Before reinstalling the system, you might drag a copy of your user 
folder to another drive.

Oh, if you have a full disk backup that is bootable, you could connect 
that to your iBook and boot off of that...hold down the option key at 
startup. The screen should show bright and clear when you start from a 
backup that is older than the loaning of the iBook.
You could also copy the video drivers from your backup.
