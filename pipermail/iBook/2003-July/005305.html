<PRE>&gt;<i>Have you ever compared the size of the VHS tape cartridge and the 
</I>&gt;<i>digital cartridge?
</I>
That's not what I said. I am NOT talking about a VHS tape. I do know the 
difference. 
 Please read this again:

&gt;&gt;<i> Ever notice that an 8mm digital tape only holds 1 hour,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whereas an analog camcorder can record 2 hours on the SAME tape? The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason is simple:
</I>

I mean the very SAME tape. IOW, the same physical object--take it out of 
one camcorder and put it into another. (In fact, my Digital 8 camcorder 
will play, but not record, 8mm and Hi-8 tapes.) If you take that same 
cartridge and put it in an 8mm analog camcorder, it will record 2 hours. 
If you put it in a digital camcorder, it will record only 1 hour. Why is 
it exactly 1 hour, rather than some odd number, which would be the case 
if it were merely a difference of data density? The tape runs through the 
camcorder twice as fast. That's not necessary, as shown by the mini-DV, 
which packs the same time into a much smaller package and shorter tape.

Joe Jones added:

&gt;<i>There are two sizes for the DV format - MiniDV and full size DV. The 
</I>&gt;<i>mini ones are the most common, since they suit the camcorder market 
</I>&gt;<i>very well. As noted before, they are only 60 minutes long. This is a 
</I>&gt;<i>technical limitation imposed by the amount of tape they can squeeze 
</I>&gt;<i>into it.
</I>and

&gt;<i>On the large format tapes, there are more varied running times. I don't 
</I>&gt;<i>have any large format consumer DV tapes, but I have plenty of pro DVCAM 
</I>&gt;<i>tapes, they range from 60 minutes right up to 184 minutes, they are 
</I>&gt;<i>about half the volume of a normal VHS tape (about half as deep, 2/3 as 
</I>&gt;<i>wide and 2/3 across). Again, if you flip the DVCAM deck into consumer 
</I>&gt;<i>DV mode, recording time goes up by a third or more due to the decrease 
</I>&gt;<i>in the track width.
</I>
I am talking about the _Digital 8_, not the Mini-DV. It uses the same 
size cartridge (and, indeed, can use the SAME cartridges, unless you buy 
the manufacturer's bs that it requires a &quot;high grade&quot; tape) as 8mm and 
Hi-8 camcorders. Here are the dimensions of the cartridges:

VHS   7-3/8&quot; w x 4-1/16&quot; deep x 15/16&quot; thick (volume about 28.1 cu in)

8mm   3-23/32&quot; w x 2-7/16&quot; deep x 17/32&quot; thick (volume about 4.82 cu in)

(FWIW, using your numbers, 1/2 deep x 2/3 wide x 2/3 across = 2/9 of the 
volume, not 1/2. That's 22% vs 50%. An 8mm cartridge is about 17% of the 
volume of a VHS cartridge.)

Sony's original digital camcorders used this cartridge and many still do. 
I can't give you a direct link, as Sony's website adds session IDs to the 
URL, so that it's 4-5 lines long. Start at:

<A HREF="http://www.sonystyle.com/">http://www.sonystyle.com/</A>

Click on the digital cameras/camcorders link on the left. On the next 
page, click on &quot;Camcorders.&quot; Notice that there are mini-DV and Digital 8 
camcorders shown on that page, with the Hi8 camcorders below.

I ran into this same confusion about two weeks ago, with a guy who is a 
certified DV producer (works for a local public-access channel). He, too, 
talked about mini-DV (which he had with him) and the pro version. I 
showed him my camcorder. His initial reaction was that it wasn't digital. 
&quot;Gee, why does it say, 'Digital 8' right on the body?&quot; I can run my Sony 
TRV-110 right into iMovie with a 6-pin-to-4-pin FireWire cable. The guy's 
reaction was, &quot;Is this something new?&quot; No, it's several years older than 
mini-DV. I don't think that it's &quot;broadcast quality,&quot; but it is certainly 
digital.
