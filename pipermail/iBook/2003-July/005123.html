Software...what a thing...it has made thieves, complainers and mad 
people out of so many of us, including me.

We don't complain about nor expect to use a set of tires on more than 
one vehicle nor to be able to eat that $50 dinner more than once nor to 
watch every movie in a theater on the one ticket (some theaters have 10 
or 20 screens showing different movies) even though we might try to 
sneak into another movie. But we will complain about a $50 piece of 
software license and that we can only use it on one computer...

Software is a different creature. Because we can easily copy it to 
another computer or steal a copy that has been serialized we think we 
should be able to. Granted, some companies have allowed copies on two 
or more computers and there are family licenses, server licenses, etc. 
I myself am grumbling about Microsoft telling me I can't install the 
drivers for my Explorer Trackball on X and on VPC since it only allows 
one installation per computer.

I am amazed at the ease with which software corrupts people, including 
myself, and how children and adults become software thieves when they 
might not steal anything more profitable like cars or diamonds. Maybe 
it's just the fear of going to jail that makes the difference.

They call themselves Pirates but why would anyone think it would be 
glamorous to associate oneself with the image of a murdering, 
plundering, raping, bloodthirsty group of individuals?

Kinda brings to mind the time when I was a bit on the down side, hungry 
and standing outside a restraunt watching people eat just inches away. 
All that kept me from their food was a window...and 5000 armed 
policemen.
