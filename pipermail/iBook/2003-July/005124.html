<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Could you simply connect your two computers and move the whole program
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the one it is installed on to the other one?  I know that's not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the answer to your concern, but it might provide a way around a silly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> policy like that.  Like you, I have two and probably most of us do and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it burns me that they are taking this sort of attitude about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> In order for such &quot;protection&quot; to work, both computers must be 
</I>&gt;<i> connected
</I>&gt;<i> to a network. When I find it necessary to use software with that kind 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;protection,&quot; I just get off the network with my iBook. There is no way
</I>&gt;<i> that I'm going to buy two copies of an application that only I use.
</I>
These attitudes are what are moving us into a world with more 
restrictive licensing, coupled with the desire of the software 
companies to make as much money as they can.

In earlier days you could move software from one computer to another as 
described and except for networking issues there would be no problem. I 
used to giggle at the troubles 4D went through to protect its 
installations and yet I could simply copy a certain accessible folder 
over to my new computer, before erasing the drive on the other, and 
avoid having to go through a complete reinstall.

However, the future will change all of this. Software companies have 
instituted online registration and upgrades are checked and verified, 
etc. Apple and Microsoft both search your drives with the updates and 
everyone can guess what that means.

So, which is worse, the licensing issue or seeing someone selling a 
computer 'filled with software worth over $10,000' on eBay.

Personally I support more rigid licensing of software since that would 
make my competitors pay up for their software just as I do. Difficult 
to compete with someone who just stole $25,000 in software to run his 
business when I pay for mine.

I also feel their should be some concession in the licensing costs for 
additional computer installations. Everyone wants it cheaper and, 
especially me.

Maybe we should license the individual for a program and then create 
thumbprint passwords or dna tests so that the individual can run the 
program on any computer in the world but someone who isn't licensed 
can't use the program on any computer, like a driver's license.

Then Apple, leading the way with light up keys, can lead the way with 
fingerprint reading keys to thwart those who might try to sneak in and 
use a running program. HONK! HONK! Bad fingertips, use denied!

Historically the ideas that tend to make everyone mad are the ideas 
that become socially accepted in a decade or so.
