</I>&gt;<i> Your quote reminds me of an experience I had on the QE2 during a Pacific 
</I>&gt;<i> adventure a couple of years ago.  They had a PC room for us to use and I 
</I>&gt;<i> told the monitor that I was a Mac user, not a PC person and asked 
</I>&gt;<i> permission to check my email.  He agreed and since he taught classes 
</I>&gt;<i> told me to come at will and if a machine was available, for me to just 
</I>&gt;<i> sit down and use it.  One day, I strolled in and he had about 15 
</I>&gt;<i> machines,but about 10 people that he was teaching...and came over and 
</I>&gt;<i> apologized about 5 of them being 'messed up' and he was awaiting the 
</I>&gt;<i> ship's engineer to come and fix them.  Seems that during the night some 
</I>&gt;<i> kids had come in and put them into and endless loop.  I sat there, 
</I>&gt;<i> staring at one while it did it's thing...then, I cut the power button 
</I>&gt;<i> and waited then rebooted it.  Lo, and behold, it was fixed!  The fellow 
</I>&gt;<i> (former professor of computer science at an Eastern U) came by just then 
</I>&gt;<i> and asked me what I'd done, and I told him quite honestly that I was a 
</I>&gt;<i> Mac person and might have ruined it.  He laughed and asked me to 'fix' 
</I>&gt;<i> the others the same way.  He seemed shocked (and I never knew if it was 
</I>&gt;<i> my lack of respect for the Windows machines, or my gall) but I 'fixed' 
</I>&gt;<i> all of them and did my email and left, very quietly.
</I>&gt;<i>
