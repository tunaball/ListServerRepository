Thanks,

I went and had a look on the web and it would appear to be numbers in 
the range PW940... to PW952... but mine is PW131..., so it would seem 
that I'm out of luck there.

A couple more observations though...
1) When I reloaded the firmware, I left it with WEP turned on. Before I 
had it turned off, and I believe that runs for longer between crashes 
with WEP turned off. I seem to remember reading that WEP along with NAT 
are rather CPU intensive... could I be working the little beasty too 
hard and over heating it?

2) Also, the unit does get warm. Not burning hot, but warm enough that 
you can feel it if you place your hand on the outer surface.

What's the warranty on these? I've only just bought this from overseas 
and I've got no idea when it was purchased, but I do have AppleCare on 
my iBook... would this mean the base station is still covered?

--Michael.

PS: I was going to reply to this last night, but between downloading my 
mail and clicking send, the thing had crashed again... 4th time in 12 hours!
