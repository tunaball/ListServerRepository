<PRE>Yeah, I remember when Digital 8 came out. The reason I think that it 
didn't catch on was that it was on the back of standard 8mm, which 
itself competed with VHSc, the small VHS tapes. With a simple adaptor 
you could play those tapes in your normal VCR, so it became the format 
of choice, even though the tapes were bigger than the 8mm ones - you 
were restricted to playing them back in your camcorder or buying a 8mm 
deck. Digital 8 was the first time that consumer equipment had gone 
digital, but it was ahead of its time.

I would imagine that the tape runs faster for a reason - it increases 
the track length, enabling you to store more data for each frame (or 
field - I don't know how digital 8 arranges data on the tape). In order 
to increase quality, Sony probably did two things with Digital 8 - 
increased the running speed of the tape, and increased the track width, 
both of which would reduce the effective recording time on the tapes.

</I>&gt;<i> That's not what I said. I am NOT talking about a VHS tape. I do know

</I>&gt;<i>  Please read this again:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ever notice that an 8mm digital tape only holds 1 hour,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> whereas an analog camcorder can record 2 hours on the SAME tape? The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reason is simple:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mean the very SAME tape. IOW, the same physical object--take it out 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> one camcorder and put it into another. (In fact, my Digital 8 camcorder
</I>&gt;<i> will play, but not record, 8mm and Hi-8 tapes.) If you take that same
</I>&gt;<i> cartridge and put it in an 8mm analog camcorder, it will record 2 
</I>&gt;<i> hours.
</I>&gt;<i> If you put it in a digital camcorder, it will record only 1 hour. Why 
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> it exactly 1 hour, rather than some odd number, which would be the case
</I>&gt;<i> if it were merely a difference of data density? The tape runs through 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> camcorder twice as fast. That's not necessary, as shown by the mini-DV,
</I>&gt;<i> which packs the same time into a much smaller package and shorter tape.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Joe Jones added:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are two sizes for the DV format - MiniDV and full size DV. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mini ones are the most common, since they suit the camcorder market
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very well. As noted before, they are only 60 minutes long. This is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical limitation imposed by the amount of tape they can squeeze
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into it.
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the large format tapes, there are more varied running times. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have any large format consumer DV tapes, but I have plenty of pro 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DVCAM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tapes, they range from 60 minutes right up to 184 minutes, they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about half the volume of a normal VHS tape (about half as deep, 2/3 as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wide and 2/3 across). Again, if you flip the DVCAM deck into consumer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DV mode, recording time goes up by a third or more due to the decrease
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the track width.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am talking about the _Digital 8_, not the Mini-DV. It uses the same
</I>&gt;<i> size cartridge (and, indeed, can use the SAME cartridges, unless you 
</I>&gt;<i> buy
</I>&gt;<i> the manufacturer's bs that it requires a &quot;high grade&quot; tape) as 8mm and
</I>&gt;<i> Hi-8 camcorders. Here are the dimensions of the cartridges:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> VHS   7-3/8&quot; w x 4-1/16&quot; deep x 15/16&quot; thick (volume about 28.1 cu in)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 8mm   3-23/32&quot; w x 2-7/16&quot; deep x 17/32&quot; thick (volume about 4.82 cu 
</I>&gt;<i> in)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (FWIW, using your numbers, 1/2 deep x 2/3 wide x 2/3 across = 2/9 of 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> volume, not 1/2. That's 22% vs 50%. An 8mm cartridge is about 17% of 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> volume of a VHS cartridge.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sony's original digital camcorders used this cartridge and many still 
</I>&gt;<i> do.
</I>&gt;<i> I can't give you a direct link, as Sony's website adds session IDs to 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> URL, so that it's 4-5 lines long. Start at:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.sonystyle.com/">http://www.sonystyle.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Click on the digital cameras/camcorders link on the left. On the next
</I>&gt;<i> page, click on &quot;Camcorders.&quot; Notice that there are mini-DV and Digital 
</I>&gt;<i> 8
</I>&gt;<i> camcorders shown on that page, with the Hi8 camcorders below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I ran into this same confusion about two weeks ago, with a guy who is a
</I>&gt;<i> certified DV producer (works for a local public-access channel). He, 
</I>&gt;<i> too,
</I>&gt;<i> talked about mini-DV (which he had with him) and the pro version. I
</I>&gt;<i> showed him my camcorder. His initial reaction was that it wasn't 
</I>&gt;<i> digital.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Gee, why does it say, 'Digital 8' right on the body?&quot; I can run my 
</I>&gt;<i> Sony
</I>&gt;<i> TRV-110 right into iMovie with a 6-pin-to-4-pin FireWire cable. The 
</I>&gt;<i> guy's
</I>&gt;<i> reaction was, &quot;Is this something new?&quot; No, it's several years older 
</I>&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;<i> mini-DV. I don't think that it's &quot;broadcast quality,&quot; but it is 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly
</I>&gt;<i> digital.
