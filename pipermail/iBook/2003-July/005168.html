<PRE>&gt;<i> Not the same.
</I>
Generaly things are disuputed by people who don't want to believe 
them...

&gt;<i> If the analogy was the same
</I>
I have stated that all analogy is subject to being proven wrong by 
looking further into than was intended...

&gt;<i> Anything less is unethical on the part of the software publishers, not 
</I>&gt;<i> the consumer.
</I>
Unethical? Where is the code of ethics on how to license one's own 
software?

Let's limit the discussion to reality and not theory.

First, the creators of the software want to make money. They also in 
their greedy natures want everyone who uses it to pay up (they may give 
copies away).

The users want to get everything for nothing but sometimes are willing 
to pay if they have to.

The real problem for the buyer is that the buyer is faced with their 
own ethical question of how trustworthy and honest they are since it is 
so easy to copy software. This produces the need for all of the 
justifications for why I am copying it.

Personally I feel the solution is to include a license for the 
individual that allows them to use the software on any computer. Devise 
a method so that an unlicensed individual cannot use the software. 
Maybe use dna or fingerprints, my iPaq Pocket PC has a fingerprint 
reader on it. Then there would be two licenses, one corporate for 
servers and one individual as just stated.

Since the Democratic party is now using my statement about giving the 
public the same insurance as politicians, which I propounded 
immediately after the Hillary Event where the wife of the President 
tried to write a law which is not legally possible, I feel this idea 
will come about.

The US Government is mailing 13 Billion dollars of tax credits to US 
Citizens to spend buying goods from Communist China. How does sending 
all of this money out of the country improve our economy?
