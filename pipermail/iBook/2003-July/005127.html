I think what David's biggest frustration is, is that back when he bought the
application, it was OK to have it installed on two computers as long as you
only used it on one computer at a time. Now the software vendor has changed
the license and considers it illegal to have it installed on a second
computer. 

We weren't thieves with the original license agreements but now we are. We
were told it was OK to install it on two machines (as long as it was used on
one at a time) but now it is illegal to install it on two machines.

More and more people are working both at home and at work and having the
application available on two machines allows you to be more productive. To
me it makes more sense NOW to be able to install an application on two
machines (running the application on one at a time) than it did 5 or 10
years ago when most people could only afford one computer.
