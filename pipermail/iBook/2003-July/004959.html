Dictionary.com's 5th definition of literature: Printed material

I suppose a person who says they graduated from Princeton might 
consider that as being picky until they realize than anyone reasonably 
educated in English would know that they should have said they were 
'graduated from Princeton'.

I cringe when I hear someone say they graduated from a school or refer 
to two objects as each rather than both. And then, after doing that, I 
make my own grammatical errors and misspellings. However, checking the 
dictionary shows that the usage is becoming more popular and perhaps in 
200 years English teachers will adjust.

However, seeing that 60% of high school graduates barely pass English 
and 30% of freshmen college students read at a 9th grade level, I 
should probably adjust my thinking in this matter...  :) [88% of all 
statistics are made up.]
