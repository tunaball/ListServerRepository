<PRE>There was some discussion about various ways to protect the iBook screen 
from marks from the keyboard, etc. I've found four types of solutions:

1) Sheet of leather, vinyl, neoprene, or cloth that sits on top of the 
keyboard.This is the simplest approach. I would be a bit leary of 
leather, as it has oils of its own. Some cover just the keyboard.

<A HREF="http://www.marware.com/keyboardcovers.html">http://www.marware.com/keyboardcovers.html</A> (neoprene, $6.95)

<A HREF="http://www.drbott.com/prod/db.lasso?code=5868-KY12">http://www.drbott.com/prod/db.lasso?code=5868-KY12</A> (Same as above)

pinc=search2 (ditto)

Others cover the trackpad and palmrests.

(microfiber, which is very soft, available in several colors/patterns)



2) Clear sheets that attach directly to the screen, like screen 
protectors for PDAs. This may sound like a good idea, but, based upon 
experience with PDAs, it's a bit difficult to put these on without 
trapping air bubbles. Also, iBook screen isn't designed to be pushed on, 
unlike a PDA's screen.

($19.99 list)

<A HREF="http://www.smalldog.com/product/43304">http://www.smalldog.com/product/43304</A> (Same thing, $18.00)


3) A fabric sleeve that covers the entire top half of the iBook. This 
protects the screen while the iBook is closed OR open. I have one and it 
works very nicely. It has the added advantage of acting like #4, 
below--the extra thickness of the fabric between the plastic bumpers on 
the top edge of the upper (screen) half and the bottom shell make the 
iBook feel firmer, with less give or slop.

(Also check their CoolShield. It looks a bit weird, but it works 
beautifully, especially in an environment where you can't control the 
lighting.)


4) A set of silicone cushions that go on the bezel around the screen. 
These are thicker than those that come with the iBook and keep the screen 
further away from the keyboard. They also make the closed iBook feel 
firmer, not as loose. These can be used with a keyboard cover, but I 
wouldn't use them with the sleeve in #3.

5) Keyboard protector. This was designed to protect the keyboard, not the 
screen, but, if you remove it every time you close the iBook, it will 
keep the keys clean and they won't be as likely to tranfer oils. I don't 
know how convenient or easy that is, as I haven't bought this, yet. See:
