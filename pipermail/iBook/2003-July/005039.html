<PRE>Well, I phoned up AppleCare on Monday and got a very helpful guy named 
Ben. I mentioned what had happened along with the wording of the Terms &amp; 
Conditions. After taking the serial number of my Base Station and a few 
details about my iBook he put me on hold and went to ask their warantee 
specialist. He came back to me a while later and explained that things 
were taking longer than expected and that he would contact me within the 
next 48 hours... if not, then he told me to phone back and quote my case 
number (which I also hadn't been given the first time round).

I've just got off the phone after Ben phoned me back and it's all good: 
I'm covered. If it's a hardware problem, then AppleCare will pay for it. 
All I need to do is mention that I have AppleCare on my iBook and there 
should be no problems.

So... for all those who don't have AppleCare: GET IT! It's just repaid 
itself here.

Cheers guy's and thanks for the advice,
--Michael.
