Awesome! Thanks, that looks like it could be useful to have on the 
screen while on the phone. I'll give them another shot and see what 
their answer is this time.

After my first try with Apple I opened up the base station and had a 
look around but couldn't find anything wrong. What I did notice is that 
the capacitors for the psu are the type being fitted to replacement 
Airport units, ie, one 220uF and one 68uF. I'm not actually sure when 
this base station was bought, since I got it second hand. Is it possible 
to find out?

Thanks again.
--Michael.
