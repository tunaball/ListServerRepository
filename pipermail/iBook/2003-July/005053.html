<PRE>This is not to flame anyone with legitimate concerns/issues as I am sure 
they exist. I just try not to add non-crucial programs which could 
affect function and use Cocktail, and other utilities, on the 
aforementioned basis. I have lurked on this list for a long time and 
just wanted to share. Apple engineers great, not perfect, hardware and 
software. It is up to us to be judicious in how we treat the hardware, 
what additions/subtractions we make to said hardware/software and our 
dedication to regular preventative maintenance.

I, for one, am very glad to hear from people who have not experienced 
the problem side of Apple products...believe me when I say that I really 
wish I was one of them. You seem to have the impression though, that 
those of us with hardware or software problems are somehow responsible 
for our problems by adding software or other hardware that seem to 
create these glitches. FYI: my experience so far with new iBooks has 
been just the opposite of yours. I have not added nor taken away from 
the original software because of wanting to make sure the problems that 
came up would not/could not be attributable to this assumption. My new 
800MHz was just sent back because of a battery seating problem. The 
original battery died for no apparent reason after only 2 weeks of 
receiving this brand new iBook. The first battery that were sent as a 
replacement could not be seated and locked into place neither could the 
second battery that was sent to me. This 800MHz iBook was a replacement 
for a brand new (not refurbished) 600MHz that crashed repeatedly from 
day one in OS 10.2.4 and in OS 9.2.2. (and that wasn't the only problem) 
OK, so, I do have Murphys in my family tree...back a few 
generations...but really! This has gone way beyond any sane definition 
of coincidence, to me anyway. I am back to using my trusty 7300 G3/400 
and I'm seriously considering selling the 800MHz when it is returned. I 
will really miss several of the OS X components but maybe I'll just wait 
on them until I can afford a Powerbook G4 w/ Panther pre-installed.
Thanks for letting me share,

Fran
