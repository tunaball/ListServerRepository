</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, I labeled this offtopic but it isn't entirely. I've come across 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> situation that has me ticked off and started me thinking...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Monday I installed Canvas 9 on a client's computer and realized it

</I>
Until the computer is connected to the network again and the program 
run. Then it is deactivated. Hardly an acceptable solution in today's 
modern world.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Now I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been a Canvas user myself since version 3 so I wondered how Deneba 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (now ACD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Systems) was going to deal with notebook/desktop owners.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a little confused by your mention of a client's computer in your 
</I>&gt;<i> story. Are you telling us that you installed YOUR copy of Canvas on a 
</I>&gt;<i> client's computer, or THEIR copy? If you installed YOUR copy of Canvas 
</I>&gt;<i> on a client's computer, I don't think you have much to complain about, 
</I>&gt;<i> as that's clearly piracy. If you're telling us you installed THEIR 
</I>&gt;<i> copy of Canvas on their laptop, and now they want to use it on their 
</I>&gt;<i> desktop and believe that they cannot, please see above for a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;workaround.&quot;
</I>
Neither. I recommended Canvas to the client years ago because I was a 
satisfied client. For my client it isn't an issue - he'll buy 4 more 
copies for his computers if he is happy with the upgrade. (Unless I can 
convince him to select a more enlightened software vendor) However, 
having seen the copy protection scheme I decided to test it out on a 
second computer in his shop to fulfill my own curiosity. Having seen 
the scheme at work I wanted to know how Canvas would deal with 
laptop/desktop combinations.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've owned PowerBooks since the day Apple released the PB 140 and most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software vendors quickly adapted their licenses allowing notebook 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> owners to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> install the software on both a desktop and a notebook.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A quick review of my software licenses shows that this is not really 
</I>&gt;<i> the case. *Apple* has often allowed users to copy their software on 
</I>&gt;<i> one desktop and one laptop, but this has changed with the release of 
</I>&gt;<i> OS X (or possibly earlier), and in any event they appear to be the 
</I>&gt;<i> enlightened exception rather than the rule. I looked at my software 
</I>&gt;<i> licenses for my full suite of graphic-design software (all the usual 
</I>&gt;<i> Adobe, Quark and Apple suspects) and could not find even ONE license 
</I>&gt;<i> that allowed me to install the same software on more than one 
</I>&gt;<i> computer. I didn't look but I believe my FONT software allows me to 
</I>&gt;<i> keep a set on one desktop and one laptop, but that's about it.
</I>
This is the case of Quark of course, they'd make us pay for a special 
Quark only keyboard if they could get away with it. Of the Adobe suite, 
until OS X I hadn't upgraded my own computer for years so I can't speak 
about more recent versions but I am quite certain that Illustrator 3 
did allow notebook/desktop installations. I'm also certain that 
SuperPaint and Pagemaker when it was an Aldus product did too. So did 
Word Perfect - including WordPerfect Works. The list used to be quite 
long. One of the reasons I'm aware of it is because I used to have 
several law offices as clients and they were sticklers for being legal 
and cheap!
