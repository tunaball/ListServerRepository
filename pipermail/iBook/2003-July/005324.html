<PRE>But is this mouse compatable with macs?
Your enthusiasm re this little mouse was catching, so I went to see about
ordering one, and in doing so, of course, I read the specs.

Could it be that you all missed the specs
OR
do you know that this will work with our ibooks despite the tech specs?
And if so, any and all ibooks????

I looked on the CC webpage webpage which lists as requirements: windows os's
So then I checked Belkin
<A HREF="http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&Section_Id=9">http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&amp;Section_Id=9</A>
9&amp;pcount=&amp;Product_Id=115398
and it also only lists windows os's.

And to be clear that we are speaking of the same mouse: I am looking at the
The Belkin optical mini 3 button mouse .... the rebate lists this as model
F8E8820PT. . .

So, what is the deal?
If it really will work, I will order one (when CC is out of &quot;updating&quot; mode)
and use the rebate which is still on fatwallet.com in a pdf file that
someone saved with the purchase dates valid thru the 19th.
Here's hoping,
Jill

Thanks for this. I went on the Dealmacs or Dealsontheweb info that
this rebate was good until 7/19 and bought one on 7/15. Couldn't find
the rebate coupon on line tho. Since they had the item for in store
pick up only, thought I would get it there. When it was there, they
said sure and printed me up the rebate form and stuck it in my bag. I
was more than a little teed off to find the rebate form that couldn't
be found online for the life of me (I searched multiple ways on the
CC site), was now only valid for purchases made on 7/13 or 7/14. The
ole switcheroo.

So getting this form now makes me feel double good.

CC really made me mad with this one. Not enough to really rant, but
enough for a slow simmer.
