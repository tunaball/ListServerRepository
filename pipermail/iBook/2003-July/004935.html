Yep, they do get warm. Go ahead and give Apple a call. AppleCare for an 
iBook covers a base station. Like you, I bought a used unit when I 
bought my iBook and the base station died about 3 months after I bought 
it. It fried big time. Apple sent a box for it and about a week later 
another unit arrived.

Good qualities are easier to destroy than bad ones, and therefore
uniformity is most easily achieved by lowering all standards.
