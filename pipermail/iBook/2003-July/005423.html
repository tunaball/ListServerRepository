<PRE>First of all, it takes time for you to train it before it works 
properly. A few hundred messages is about right.

IMAP is really meant to do this but unfortunately, most isp's don't 
allow it. IMAP stores *all* of your messages on their server, versus 
storing them on your computer. There is several different pop mail 
options that can get you the same effect in mail.app. Located under 
advanced.

	Remove copy from server after retrieving message
right away
after one day
after one week
after one month
when removed from inbox.

You can have unchecked remove copy from server on one computer and as 
long as you check that one first, both will be distributed evenly. I 
would probably leave the ibook unchecked and have the desktop &quot;remove&quot; 
them, just because I'd would more likely to use the ibook first because 
its mobile.

  You could also do a after one week, and a copy if left on the server 
for one week. So both should be able to get the same messages as long 
as both check within a week.

What I personally do is  &quot;when removed from inbox&quot;. I got numerous mail 
filters, and so mail lists go to their own folder automatically. So all 
&quot;important&quot; email (from work/family) is left in the inbox. Then I can 
get it from web-mail if I need it. The latest version is a *lot* better 
with this option. A version or so ago, it would hiccup every once in a 
while and forget what messages it had downloaded.

thanks,
Ian Sidle
