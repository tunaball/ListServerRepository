I am becoming more attached to my idea of adding a user license and 
giving away the software as is now being done via piracy. Licensing the 
user and a server license for corporations would be the best idea. Then 
the individual could put the software on as many personal computers as 
they like.

&gt;<i> Perhaps they should even address the concept of how much is packed

Like the Finder, where you can show all features or just a limited set 
of menus. 4D tried that idea and it didn't work too well for them. 
Final Cut Express is an attempt to do this. Do you think Graphic 
Converter gives Photoshop users an alternative?

Since the Iraqis have all that oil and want the US to leave, why 
shouldn't the US depart and let them pay for their own rebuilding with 
the oil and maybe a few hundred billion for our expenses in setting 
them free of Sadaam?
