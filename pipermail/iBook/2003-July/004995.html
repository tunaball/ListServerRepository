Warping - it really is a non-issue. Out of the tens of thousands of 
iBooks manufactured a few will have defects. That is a fact of life. 
Remember, these lists and online forums are where people talk about 
their problems. We don't write to say - &quot;Hey, I got my iBook today and 
it is perfect!!&quot; Well, most of us don't. &lt;grin&gt; Okay - &quot;my iBook is 15 
months old and still chugging along without a single flaw. Just like 
the Tangerine iBook before it.&quot;

As for the screen marks...this really is an issue - of sorts. Thin 
notebooks are important for marketing. Thin means good - thick means 
bad. The clearance between the LCD and keyboard is minimal. When we got 
the new iBook lab at work I kept watch and noticed the markings within 
a few weeks. Cleaning the screens got rid of them - it was just oil - 
no actual impression into the screen that I could see. So we just put 
some chamois cloths on the cart and asked teachers to see that the 
keyboards got cleaned off when they were finished. I clean my keyboard 
every week and haven't seen any marks on my screen since - but I did at 
first.

Pick the model you want, be sure to add more memory, and go for it.

Good qualities are easier to destroy than bad ones, and therefore
uniformity is most easily achieved by lowering all standards.
