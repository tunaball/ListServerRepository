Forgive me if it's been said already, but what about the argument that 
I paid for the license, therefore it's one license, one user, not one 
license, one computer?

My Mac didn't pay for the Photoshop software, I did.    I use it on my 
iBook at home and on my PowerMac at work.   I am the only user of this 
license.    I own it.    I don't agree that EULA gibberish gives away 
my rights, no matter what lawyers say about it.

If you ever read this 6 point type EULA garbage, it probably says that 
you can't install it on two computers even if you own both a laptop and 
a Desktop.    So what about portable Hard Drives?   I carried Pagemaker 
on a ZIP cartridge to a client's office, and demonstrated how to set up 
a newsletter.   I figured I was giving a free audition for Adobe !     
And when I was done, I took the ZIP home.   So, what would the EULA say 
about this?

Of course, if the Laptop Docking technology had matured, this would be 
a moot point.   You'd just install everything on your laptop and carry 
it home with you.   And some SciFi books I've read suggest that all 
your apps and files could be on a Proteus, a wearable computer that 
when you got the work would just interface with your workstation.

I think Adobe's just being greedy.   Which is sad, since they're the 
last bastion of defense we have against M$oft.   Decent software, and 
it's not from Apple.   What a concept.
