<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm almost ready to buy a new iBook. Are there any models--the newest
</I>&gt;<i> ones, perhaps??--that don't have the problems mentioned with warping
</I>&gt;<i> and/or screen marks?
</I>
I have listened to all the discussion on this list about these two 
issues and finally dedicded to share the results of my research, 
opinions and experience.

Everything about the iBook is as small, as thin and as lightweight as 
possible. Everything about the iBook is carefully designed to be as 
stylish as possible and to let the mechanical stuff be as invisible as 
possible. There are some consequences with all these restrictions.

1. Warp issue&#8212;in line with keeping the mechanics invisible, we have the 
matter of the latch. I suspect space problems required the redesign of 
the hinge and latch. The Clamshell was my favorite but I'm sure it took 
more room to make it work successfully. The design of the TiBook hinge 
(which preceeded the iBook) was  discarded because of some design flaws 
with it and because of the smaller size of the iBook. The ibook hinge 
gives us full use of the screen and a sense of roominess that we would 
not get if the screen sat on top of the keyboard and it would also mean 
we might have to give up the speakers or put up with less ones.

With the matter out of the way, there is till how do we firmly close 
the thing and make sure that it signals the processor to go to sleep? 
The pre TiBook and iBook generations had a very firm, large, &quot;normal&quot; 
metal tongue and latch device. They also had much thicker, heavier and 
metal enclosures and frames. Once the die was cast, the edge was true 
(pardon the die pun). The iBook didn't have any of these options so a 
new design was needed and it was kept in line with the rest of the 
&quot;lightness &quot; of the ibook design.

A tiny, firm piece of metal (tongue) fits into the latch and locks in 
place. So far just like the old PBs. But they had the tongue 
permanently protruding and visible, The iBook tongue is invisible when 
the lid is open. As it closes, gravity gently eases the tongue out and 
down, When it gets close to the latch slot, a magnet gently eases it 
down and &quot;sucks&quot; it into the latch securing it and closing the circuit 
to be sure the cpu stays asleep.

Obviously, the lid weighs more than the little tongue and the magnet 
maintains a certain amount of tension on the tongue to keep it securely 
latched. The lid exerts a slight weight tension in the direction of 
&quot;open&quot; and the magnet exerts an opposing tension towards keeping it 
closed&#8212;balance and counter balanced, opposing and counteropposing 
forces. Except the weight of the lid wins a tiny bit more in this 
contest because the tongue is in the middle and there are no equalizing 
forces or latches to hold in the weight on the free edges. Voila! a 
slight variation between the  air space at the edge and in the middle. 
Optical illusion further magnifies the difference and makes it look 
like warping. If you put a level on all edges of the lid, there is no 
warpage. They are still true.

2. The close tolerance and spacing between the lid and the keyboard 
creates another problem&#8212;The screen bezel rests on the keys. This 
actually is two problems. Oil marks on the screen and scratch marks on 
the bezel.

When you use the keyboard, the keys pick up a thin film of whatever is 
on your fingers and there will always be a thin film of oil on even the 
squeekiest clean fingers. If you are like me and many other computer 
users, you drink and eat around your computer and you never wash your 
hands each and every time you plan to use the keyboard.

When the lid is closed, all this grime and oil transfers to the screen 
if the lid closes really tight and there is NO AIR SPACE AT THE EDGES 
to keep a margin of separation between the keys and the screen and 
bezel.

Screen Marks Solution: Pick your choice
1. Wash your hands each time you are using the keyboard and do not 
touch anything but the keyboard without re-washing.  Not practical and 
nobody would do it.

2. Clean the keyboard everytime it is used and just before closing the 
lid (each time the lid is closed even for a few seconds), Better but 
who would remember to do it for the few seconds the lid is closed to 
sleep it while you get the phone or similar tasks?

3.Clean the keyboard everytime it is used AND use a CLEAN intervening 
material between the screen and the keyboard&#8212;BEST SOLUTION but also not 
always practical or remembered.

4. BEST COMPROMISE&#8212;Keep a CLEAN material handy to put on the keyboard 
EVERY TIME you close the computer.

Bezel Scratches Solution:
Placing material on the keyboard large enough to cover the entire 
surface prevents the bezel and keys from contacting and scratching each 
other.

Wash the material frequently in a non oily soap and don't use and 
fabric softners on it, they may contain a light oily substance that is 
transferred to the material. Many of the commercial products sold are 
made from a specially processed leather which is great as far as it 
goes. The problem is the leather gets thrown around and handled and 
never washed so it will eventually pick up enough oils or substances to 
stain or etch the screen.

The company that makes the screen cleaner for Apple also makes 
disposable cleaning cloths that can be used as screen protectors also. 
They als make a microfiber cloth that can be used as a cleaning or 
protecting material. It is also washable so it can be kept oil and soil 
free. There are also other companies that make similar items. In a 
pinch a very soft paper towel or clean sheet of paper will solve the 
problem. The piece of foam that was on the keyboard when you opened the 
box is an excellent  option if you wash it frequently.

One final caveat from personal experience:
When you pack your laptop (any and ALL kinds of laptops) in a case, 
NEVER pack irregular shaped objects next to the screen. Always pack 
something firm and flat next to the screen, ie, a magazine, a legal 
pad, etc. Never over pack the case. If you place a hub, a 
surgeprotector, a mouse, etc next to the screen and then you also 
overpack the bag, it becomes possible for the irregular shape to press 
unevenly on the screen and break the TFT layer&#8212;expensive repair.

I lucked out and even though I had overpacked because I made sure no 
objects could create pressure points, I didn't have any problems. A 
friend of mine on the same trip wasn't as lucky and lost his screen.

If you already have indelible screen marks and they interfere with  
your use of the ibook, MacResQ.com has perfected a method of removing 
the polarizer layer which contains the stains and then restoring the 
polarizer for $299 which includes shipping costs.
