Your analogies don't cut it. I'm not asking to consume something twice 
and only pay once. I own two Macs which can run the same software, just 
as I own two 2002 Saturns. If I wanted, I could buy 4 Michelins and 
move them from one Saturn to the other. My Michelin 'license' doesn't 
restrict me to just one car. Sure, it would be silly to trade the tires 
from one car to the other, but I'm not restricted by Michelin from 
doing so. Similarly, when I went to Sears for a new set of wrenches, 
the salesman didn't ask me which car I intended using them on. I can 
use them how I choose.

What software companies are increasingly doing are restricting how I am 
permitted to use what I have legitimately bought. Let's see how that 
works at your theatre...

Usher: Oh, I'm sorry sir, you'll have to leave.

Jack: Why?

Usher: Because you are watching Terminator 4 but you are eating Finding 
Nemo 2 popcorn

Good qualities are easier to destroy than bad ones, and therefore
uniformity is most easily achieved by lowering all standards.
