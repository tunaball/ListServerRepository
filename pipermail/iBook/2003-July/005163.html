<PRE>&gt;<i> From: andy &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">letterspackages at telus.net</A>&gt;

Unless you want to get your dev friend in BIG TROUBLE, I would strongly 
suggest NOT calling Apple. What he did was ILLEGAL and at *minimum* 
he'd be kicked out of the ADC with NO refund.

You and any others out there who have &quot;bootleg&quot; copies of Panther would 
be well-advised to remember three things:

1. You're breaking the law, and depending on how reckless you are, you 
could easily expose yourself to litigation.
2. Panther is in ALPHA. There are BIG, SERIOUS, NOT-YET-KNOWN BUGS. As 
in DATA-DESTROYING bugs. I've seen many reports of problems, ranging 
from minor to very serious.
3. You *cannot* upgrade your install of Panther Preview to the full 
version. That means you must WIPE the drive if you want to use the 
final release.

No lectures, just FYI. Believe me, I really *do* understand the 
curiousity factor, but just like a real panther, this software's got 
teeth ... and it can come back to bite you BIG TIME.

&quot;With the introduction of the new iTunes Music Store, we've now built 
the  first real complete ecosystem for the digital music age. We've got 
a way to buy music online legally that's fantastic -- it's better than 
any other way to acquire music. We've got a way manage music with the 
iTunes  Jukebox, which is the best in the world. And we've got a way to 
listen to music on the go with the iPod, which is the most popular MP3 
player in the world and one of the coolest things in the world. So 
we've really got, from one end to another, a complete solution for 
digital music. We're the only people in the world to do this, so we 
feel great about it.&quot; -- Steve Jobs, Time Magazine, 30-April-03
