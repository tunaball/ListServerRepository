I have presented the idea that an additional license should be offered 
for the individual and such person could use the software anywhere it 
exists. People who are not licensed could not use the software, unless 
it was licensed for universal use on one machine.

I am on the side of those who dislike the single computer license and 
agree there should be more friendly licenses:

A corporate license for those companies with numerous employees sharing 
a server. This is basically what the present day licenses offer.

A developer's license to cover the guy like me and us who has several 
computers and actually helps spread the use of a particular piece of 
software. Filemaker, for instance, turned its back on the small guy who 
was responsible for the growth of Filemaker and when it went cross 
platform and corporate. A certified, city and state licensed, person or 
company should be given especially low prices and support since they 
are evangelizing the software.

A home license for non-commercial use similar to what Apple offers 
since more and more homes are becoming multi-computer.

The super-individual license that allows the person to use the software 
on any computer. This will come about when software is free and a way 
is found to enforce the license.

&gt;<i> My Mac didn't pay for the Photoshop software, I did.    I use it on my 
</I>&gt;<i> iBook at home and on my PowerMac at work.   I am the only user of this 
</I>&gt;<i> license.    I own it.    I don't agree that EULA gibberish gives away 
</I>&gt;<i> my rights, no matter what lawyers say about it.
</I>
Unfortunately EULAs are now forced upon the user when the software is 
installed and you must click on the I Agree button when you install the 
software. How would any of us feel if we have an agreement to be paid 
so much for our work and when done, the other person refuses to pay? A 
man is only as good as his word, an old concept.

Software licenses are also enforced, if need be, by the million guns 
owned by the military and the same number or so of Police officers. 
Historically licenses haven't been enforced except on a network but all 
the companies are trying to find a way to do so. Some companies are 
using your internet connection to stay in touch.
