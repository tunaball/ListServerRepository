<PRE>Fred:

Do a search for Keyboard Cleaner - a while back it was a Mac Gems  
from macworld.com (written by Dutch programmer Jan Prima).  This is a  
freeware program that disables all keyboard commands except command- 
quit (used to exit the program, duh).  I have not tried it myself,  
but read some good comments about it.  One reply said &quot;why not just  
disconnect your keyboard&quot; to which someone further replied &quot; every  
try that on a laptop?&quot;

I have a new kitten which loves walking, running, romping, and  
otherwise crossing my iBook's keyboard while I'm using it. She has  
found new keystroke commands that I had never dreamed existed nor  
were possible. I can't state what keys she pressed since her speed  
across the keyboard approaches Warp 9, but the effects are such  
things as causing an application's window to jump up and down, change  
applications, move a window left, right, or down, and a lot more,  
none of which I knew was possible with keystroke commands. None of  
these are direct functions of the keys' surface purposes, i.e.,  
alphabet, numbers, characters, screen brightness, sound levels, etc.  
I have long since disabled all keystroke commands and Function keys  
in System Preferences. I couldn't find any preference to change in  
the Finder Preferences and I tried Onyx to see if there is something  
I'm missing. Nothing. Yet, this little furry monster (her name is  
Earthquake for obvious reasons, age 3 months) manages to change my  
whole screen performance by dashing over the keyboard. (She's also  
learned it's fun to pry up the keys with her little claws, but that's  
another problem.)

Any ideas or suggestions short of completely severing the keyboard  
power strip or caging what is probably the cutest kitten since they  
invented kittens?

Fred
