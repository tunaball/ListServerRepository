Well it does have BlueTooth so potentially a keyboard could be used that way.

I watch movies and TV shows on my Palm Tx which has 480x320 
resolution.  It is very nice.  It is as good a display as most analog 
TVs, or at least the difference is negligible.

</I>
Hopefully they won't put a harddrive in the iPhone.  They just aren't 
rugged enough for the abuse a phone gets.  The Palm LifeDrive is 
rather passe now, I have a TX with a 4Gb SD card in it, that, AFAIK 
can do anything the LifeDrive can.  And a version of the  iPhone is 
coming with 8Gb.
