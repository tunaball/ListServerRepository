<PRE>No offense at all Angus! 
 
I don't believe you're getting a true OS X mini Mac like you're thinking,
however. The iPhone will indeed be running a trimmed down version of OS X,
like an OS X Lite, and it won't be able to be a substitute for truly having
a laptop for computing work. 
 
I believe one disadvantage is not having a slide out keyboard.... The
onscreen tap keyboards are not for quick entry and makes replying to emails
arduous. There doesn't look to be handwriting recognition like the old
Newtons. I have an iPaq 3835 without a keyboard and tapping sucked. The
Cingular 8525 I have now has the slide out keyboard (Blackberry brought them
back into style actually) and it beats handwriting recognition every time. 
 
I absolutely love the iPhone's screen. The 480x320 resolution will be much
appreciated by every user, and I often wish my 320x240 pixel screen had more
resolution and more screen space. I think web browsing on the iPhone will be
top in its class. 
 
Once they get hard drives inside the iPhone, making it essentially an
awesome Apple version of the Palm LifeDrive, NOW you're talking about the
ability to start replacing a laptop. 
 
For those people with standard POP3/IMAP4 email accounts (i.e. not running
on an Exchange server) that haven't already entered the Blackberry/GoodLink
market, this device will blow you away and you'll love the on-the-go
connectivity. Be prepared for a more chunky device than you are used to
carrying around, but it is worth it.  Also, no matter what device you own,
be prepared to pay Cingular an extra $40 / month for the unlimited PDA data
connectivity.  That's on top of your voice charges.
 
Oh yea... I don't care how great they claim the screen is and what types of
cases are sold at launch.... slap on a membrane screen protector immediately
when you open the box and replace it every 30 days. You'll be glad you did. 
 
Tom
