<PRE>Now please understand.... I've been an Apple fan since the early days and
have probably been responsible for more Apple II and Mac sales than some
small stores. 
 
However, the iPhone is hardly revolutionary. It's a nice attractive device..
but little is really new except streamlining the syncing with iTunes. 
 
I am currently using a Cingular 8525, which has the Windows Mobile 5.0 OS.
Now the OS is clunky and not intuitive all the time, but it is touchscreen,
GPRS/EDGE/UMTS data compatible, quad-band, and it is pulling my email real
time 24 hours a day.  The built in camera is 2 megapixel and the bluetooth
is also version 2.0.
 
And the email it pulls is from 3 POP3/SMTP accounts, 2 IMAP4 accounts, and
it runs GoodLink and keeps my PDA in sync with my Outlook Email, Calendar
and Contacts with my work email. It has been an enormous benefit to me in
being productive both professionally and personally.
 
It runs Internet Explorer to surf, has tons of freeware games, Pocket
Word/Excel/Powerpoint programs and compatibility, etc. 
 
I'm not in love with it, but it is better than I've had in the past. The
iPhone is a great start and full of all the class Apple is famous for, but I
need the pocket Office applications and I need the GoodLink synchronization
with the office, Also, the iPhone has EDGE, not UMTS (3G data) speeds. 
 
Kudos to Apple for an outstanding device, but the current crop of Blackberry
/ GoodLink users will not likely be swayed, and anybody with an iPod with
more than 8GB already has more storage.

&gt;&gt;<i> if if can't run GoodLink it's useless to me 
</I> 
And.. 
 
&gt;&gt;<i> Are there many people on the list that really 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WANT an integrated phone/iPod device 
</I> 
I don't think you appreciate how powerful this device is. It is a computer
in a 
Phone. It's running Mac OSX (Leopard, probably). It's quite possible that 
(unless it's crippled by phone companies) it will be simple to recompile Mac

OSX applications to run on the phone. I very much doubt it will be useless
to 
You - for example, since it has Wireless Networking, how long will it be
until 
You can use Skype on it (and bypass the phone carrier)? 
It has bluetooth, so it will probably automatically synchronise with any Mac
you 
Choose, Calender, address book, emails, preferences, iChats.. 
 
It's amazing to think that this phone is nearly as powerful as my iBook G4
800! 
 
This device stands a head and shoulders above everything else in the market
- I 
Reckon it could be as revolutionary as the ipod...
