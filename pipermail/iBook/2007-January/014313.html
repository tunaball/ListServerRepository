<PRE>Robin,
I had a similar problem with my own G3 dual usb.  I bought this comp
off my brother in law for $100.  He had the same problem and got apple
to replace the motherboard.  However, after a few years the problem
returned, only a few months after the recall ended.  However, THERE IS
a solution.  It's not really for the faint of heart, but it sure as
hell beats an $880 repair.  (What my local apple store wanted to
replace the logic board.)   I decided to fix it myself with some
thermal paste, some hobbyist aluminum, and some plastic spacers.  I
have photos and detailed instructions on how to do it yourself.  If
you are interested in using them (or want those dullard computer
&quot;experts&quot; you know to use them)  feel free to drop me a line, and i
would be happy to send them to you.

Cheers,
Sam Patteson

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a dual USB white G3 iBook that is having display problems, and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm wondering if this is one of the symptoms of the motherboard
</I>&gt;<i> problem that has been discussed here before -- or something else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About two weeks ago I was just doing my thing when suddenly my screen
</I>&gt;<i> went funny -- wavy horizontal lines appeared on it, everything froze,
</I>&gt;<i> then it went black. I tried to reboot a couple of times, and I could
</I>&gt;<i> hear the hard drive spin and the machine boot up, but the display
</I>&gt;<i> remained black. In all my brilliance (not), I decided that the
</I>&gt;<i> display was messed up, and I took the laptop to my local &quot;computer
</I>&gt;<i> guy&quot; the next day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After a day or two they called me and told me the problem was my
</I>&gt;<i> battery. They said the battery wasn't holding a charge, and that even
</I>&gt;<i> plugged in, somehow the power supply goes through the battery -- so
</I>&gt;<i> the display was not getting enough power to run. They ordered me a
</I>&gt;<i> new battery and gave me a loaner while waiting for the new one to
</I>&gt;<i> come in. I took all this home, and the first time I started up,
</I>&gt;<i> things seemed fine; but before long, the same symptoms returned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This time, though, because I am both stubborn and desperate &lt;g&gt;, I
</I>&gt;<i> started just trying different things, and I eventually discovered
</I>&gt;<i> that if I squeezed the edges of the laptop case while rebooting, I
</I>&gt;<i> could get the display to work, at least temporarily. I then brought
</I>&gt;<i> home several of those big binder clips from my office and clamped
</I>&gt;<i> them on the edges of the laptop where I had been squeezing. With
</I>&gt;<i> those in place, I can get it to work about 75 percent of the time;
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using it now to type and send this message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The computer guys are now stumped. Oh -- by the way, the new battery
</I>&gt;<i> came in, and I replaced the old one with it; still having the same
</I>&gt;<i> issues. Any thoughts from the list? This now sounds to me more like a
</I>&gt;<i> connection or motherboard issue than a battery issue, but I'd be
</I>&gt;<i> grateful for any advice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
