<PRE>My iBook 600MHz arrived 12-14-01, so my Apple Care is gone. It was down 
to Houston in October with no video, then in November with backlight 
problems. Right around the holidays it was found to be powered off when 
it should have been sleeping. Then a time or two it powered off when 
placed on a table. The critical spot was the left side. It was fairly 
reproducible, place it on the table left side first, or close the lid 
firmly and it would turn off. I called Apple, they would not send a 
box, but said take it to the Apple Store with the paperwork from the 
two covered repairs, as the Apple Care repairs have a 90 day warranty.  
I backed up my hard drive and took it to the Apple Store in King of 
Prussia on Thursday, January 20. Luckily it shut off when I was showing 
it to the Genius. He filled out some paperwork, I signed it, and I left 
it there. They called on Tuesday and I picked it up Thursday the 27th. 
It had been sent to Houston again. Apple Care took care of it.

Two of the repairs came back with 3rd party letters, telling me my 
512MB ram module was faulty. But the ram was fine. I just put it back 
in. Now I find it's missing a foot. I have an old battery, thought I 
could bum a foot off that, but then I found the battery foot is not the 
same as the other three. So I bought some from PBParts.com, 4 @ $2ea, + 
$4 to ship 'em.

We have a bunch of old yo-yo power adapters from the old clamshell 
iBooks, with that little &quot;generation gap&quot; adapter from Madsonline I can 
keep them scattered around the house so there is power almost anywhere 
I need it. Sure do miss my iBook when it is away for repair. 

</PRE>
