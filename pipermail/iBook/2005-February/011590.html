<PRE>
This brings up a question that has been lurking in the back of my
mind....

Has anyone tried the music scoring capabilities of Garage Band 2 yet?
How does it work for two hand piano pieces?  It seems like very capable
lower cost solution compared to Finale.

Hi all,

I hope that this isn't too off topic and that no one is offended by this
message.

I recently entered a music contest put up by my good friend Tim Gerwing.
He's put out his second album of ambient / electronic music and made up
a 'remix contest' for one of the pieces, entitled Stream of
Consciousness.  I had fun making my entry, using Garageband on my little
G3 iBook, and I hope you will enjoy it.  I had never used Garageband
before, and really found it easy to use and, as with all things Mac very
intuitive.  In fact, my six year old son has been having fun making his
own tracks now, after watching how much fun I had with it.

I invite you to take a listen to the original piece, as well as the
entries in the contest (of which one is mine, entitled Fearsome Remix).
As it is a contest, you are encouraged to vote for the
piece(s) you like the most.  Currently there are only four entries, but
you're allowed to vote for your three favorites, and the contest doesn't
close until Feb 28th.  Vote early, vote often, and if you like, why
don't you enter the contest yourself?  You've got Garageband, don't you?
