&gt;<i> The first has to do with the trackpad. Every so often -- and there 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem to be any pattern to which applications cause this, etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> -- my cursor will freeze on the screen or even disappear, and no 
</I>&gt;<i> amount of touching or rubbing or wiping the trackpad will make it 
</I>&gt;<i> re-start. What does seem to work is blowing on it.
</I>
I also have a freezey trackpad. Usually sleeping the machine and waking 
it up again would fix it. A couple days ago I finally had a look at the 
cable connection to the logic board (just to the south of the ram slot) 
and found it was loose. Doh.

So it could be that...

Apropos of nothing, my sleep light occasionally stops working, but I'm 
not pulling the whole book apart for that, not till I get a new HD to 
put in at the same time.

&gt;<i> The second issue is with my battery. It won't stay &quot;seated&quot; in place. 
</I>&gt;<i> If I unlatch it and take it out, then click it back in and re-latch 
</I>&gt;<i> the lock, it will light up and connect for a few seconds, but shortly 
</I>&gt;<i> after that, the little battery icon will &quot;x&quot; out again. Efforts like 
</I>&gt;<i> pressing on it, holding it in, etc. don't help. So I'm stuck to my 
</I>&gt;<i> power cord for the time being.
</I>
You mean the battery doesn't _physically_ stay in place (ie. fall out 
of the machine?) or it just won't talk to the iBook? If the latter, 
resetting the power manager might help. You can apparently reset the 
battery's on board electronics by shorting a couple of the terminals, 
but I forget which ones they are... or the battery is just hosed. It is 
of a certain age, after all.

SM.

Only with the recent development of protective nets and greenhouses 
were we able to defeat the thrushes.
