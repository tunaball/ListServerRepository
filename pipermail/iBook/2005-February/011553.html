  Speaking of fixing these plugs, I just spent last night working on two 
of them. These are numbers 3 and 4 that have died on me due to a 
breaking wire near the connector.

  I have not been able to find a similar plug anywhere with that metal 
sleeve around a mini plug, however in my disassembly I learned a few 
things.

  The little plug is a normal, mini stereo plug (ring,tip,sleeve) but 
only uses 2 wires in it(ring, sleeve). The metal sleeve was not 
connected to anything. I had thought that it might be a ground.

  I was able to cut away the plastic and then separate the metal sleeve 
from it's collar. Then after connecting new wires, I put the collar and 
sleeve back on and cover the whole thing with shrink tubing and tape, 
making sure to have enough stress relief.
  I now have 2 slightly less attractive, but fully functional power 
supplies.

  I was considering making the plug without the sleeve, if I was unable 
to save it. I think it was designed that way for safety. Neither the 
tip, nor the sleeve, the parts you would come in contact with, have any 
power running through them, and the sleeve probably ensures that the 
plug goes in straight.

  Using it without a sleeve, you would try not to touch the two contacts 
that have power and be careful when inserting the plug, to prevent 
shorting the contacts.
