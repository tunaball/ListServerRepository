<PRE>Hi all,

I hope that this isn't too off topic and that no one is offended by
this message.

I recently entered a music contest put up by my good friend Tim
Gerwing.  He's put out his second album of ambient / electronic music
and made up a 'remix contest' for one of the pieces, entitled Stream
of Consciousness.  I had fun making my entry, using Garageband on my
little G3 iBook, and I hope you will enjoy it.  I had never used
Garageband before, and really found it easy to use and, as with all
things Mac very intuitive.  In fact, my six year old son has been
having fun making his own tracks now, after watching how much fun I
had with it.

I invite you to take a listen to the original piece, as well as the
entries in the contest (of which one is mine, entitled Fearsome
Remix).  As it is a contest, you are encouraged to vote for the
piece(s) you like the most.  Currently there are only four entries,
but you're allowed to vote for your three favorites, and the contest
doesn't close until Feb 28th.  Vote early, vote often, and if you
like, why don't you enter the contest yourself?  You've got
Garageband, don't you?
