<PRE>No, gentle taps don't work. I am unwilling to smash it against the 
table or throw it on the floor, but have been tempted to a couple of 
times... &lt;grin&gt;. Of course, this computer did do a end over end 
tumble down about 15 marble subway steps about 8 months ago, but has 
worked well ever since, until now.

Eric&lt;--- in England on his way back to Seoul all too soon.

PS I do have AppleCare.


&gt;<i>In the &quot;old days&quot;, i.e. more than 5 years ago, older hard drives might
</I>&gt;<i>suffer from &quot;stiction&quot;, which was a sticky head after non-use.
</I>&gt;<i>Solution: bang it.  And then the drives would work fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I doubt that's your problem, but it would be curious to see that after
</I>&gt;<i>your next freeze, if a gentle nudge or tap to the hard drive made it
</I>&gt;<i>work again.

</I>&gt;<i>[mailto:<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">ibook-bounces at listserver.themacintoshguy.com</A>] On Behalf Of Eric
</I>&gt;<i>Richardson
</I>&gt;<i>Sent: Sunday, February 06, 2005 5:11 PM
</I>&gt;<i>To: A place to discuss Apple's iBook computers.
</I>&gt;<i>Subject: [iBook] Hard drive problems
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have been having problems with my G4 iBook, 60 gig, 640 MB, using
</I>&gt;<i>Panther lately. The problem is that it will just freeze up on me and
</I>&gt;<i>when I reboot it can't find the system folder on the hard drive. I
</I>&gt;<i>think the hard drive is whirring for a couple of seconds, but it
</I>&gt;<i>doesn't see the drive and I get the flashing question mark file
</I>&gt;<i>folder icon that says it can't find the system. I was thinking that
</I>&gt;<i>maybe it was a heat issue, if I shut it down for a half hour or so it
</I>&gt;<i>would reboot okay... until yesterday.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The internal hard drive checks out okay with disk utility including
</I>&gt;<i>the SMART verification and techtools pro from AppleCare and
</I>&gt;<i>DiskWarrior, when the system is up. But when the system is down on
</I>&gt;<i>the internal drive, I can boot up from an emergency CD I made, from a
</I>&gt;<i>firewire external drive that I have, from the installation disk that
</I>&gt;<i>came with the iBook, etc, and none of them will see the internal hard
</I>&gt;<i>drive to check it out when the internal system won't boot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I was thinking I would take it in to the Apple Store soon, and ask
</I>&gt;<i>them about it. But yesterday, it froze up and wouldn't reboot and
</I>&gt;<i>couldn't see the system... for the last 30 some hours. I have to
</I>&gt;<i>leave town tomorrow and not having the iBook with me would be a
</I>&gt;<i>problem, but I was preparing to take it in today anyway (what else
</I>&gt;<i>could I do?), and spent a couple of hours booted off the external
</I>&gt;<i>drive taking care of business that needed to be done before I
</I>&gt;<i>could... and shut it down, and went to start it up one more time. Lo
</I>&gt;<i>and behold, after multiple retries and starting up with all those
</I>&gt;<i>other disks, it finally saw the internal hard drive system again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Since not having it with me will be a problem, I have decided to hold
</I>&gt;<i>off taking the iBook to the repair until later, and will spend the
</I>&gt;<i>evening backing up some things that I realized today I would regret
</I>&gt;<i>losing. If whatever it is doesn't happen again before I can.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway, does anyone have any insight on what the problem is here? or
</I>&gt;<i>suggestions? Part of the problem of course is that when it does boot
</I>&gt;<i>up fine, then it will appear to the Apple tech folks that it has no
</I>&gt;<i>problem, since none of the repair programs see any problem. And when
</I>&gt;<i>it is down, you can't see it the disk at all. And then it will
</I>&gt;<i>randomly just start acting okay again. As it stands now, I can make
</I>&gt;<i>the two hour trek to the Apple store and say it isn't working and
</I>&gt;<i>then have it boot up fine. Or not, but then have it sit waiting for
</I>&gt;<i>the tech guy to boot... and then it will boot up fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Eric in Seoul (on his way to England)
