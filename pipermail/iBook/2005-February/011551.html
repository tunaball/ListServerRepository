<PRE>As a new owner of an iBook and recent owner of a Ti550 I thought I'd
weigh in on this issue.

I just bought a 14.1&quot; 1.3 G4 combo drive iBook to replace my 15.2&quot; 550
G4 combo drive Ti PowerBook. There are things I could do w/ the 550
that I can't with the iBook, like dual monitor support. When doing
video editing, or application development, it was a godsend. I would
connect a flat panel to the VGA port on the back and get an instant
second desktop.

I also had more real estate on the screen. My Ti had 1152 x 768, this
one is confined to 1024 x 768.

My decision to get the iBook was essentially an interim one. I'm
holding out for a dual core G5 PowerBook. When I get one, provided of
course that Apple actually gets around to selling them, my wife will
get this one and we'll sell her 12&quot; 700 G3 iBook.

There are features that I didn't get by buying this iBook that would
have meant something to me. More video memory, more screen real
estate, greater ram capacity, dual monitor support and a backlit
keyboard (if I had that I could ditch my FlyLight). But considering
that this would eventually go to my wife, and she could care less
about the features I just mentioned and the considerable difference in
price, the decision to buy the iBook was an obvious one.

Don't get me wrong, I think this iBook is a tremendous machine.
Besides, there were definate cons to owning a Ti PowerBook, scratches
and dents being the top two on my list. It seemed that you couldn't
look at the thing sideways with out scratching the paint. I always had
to take off my watch to prevent scratching the wrist pad even more,
and once you got a dent on it, it was there to stay. I don't know how
the Al PowerBooks stack up in this regard.

Just my two cents...
