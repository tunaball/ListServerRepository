As it is iBook related and as quite a few people travel with laptops I think
it may be relevant for the list...(correct me if I am wrong!)

First and cheapest may be to do a search on (free) hotspots in the
UK...London will / should be full of them...not tried this myself yet as I
try to avoid the place but try checking

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.macuser.co.uk/">http://www.macuser.co.uk/</A>&gt;
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.co.uk/">http://www.zdnet.co.uk/</A>&gt;
among others...

Airport and an iBook and free wireless access points are the best...I
believe that in London area the symbols for a public WiFi are even etched in
the sidewalks or the corners of the buildings?....(can't remember where I
read it though)

otherwise (or in addition)...

I found having the BT (British Telecom) basic line rental (somewhere around
8-9 GBP per Month) along with a Virgin.net account to be very stable and
priced right...they have different plans available but either a dial up pay
as you go account or a flat rate 24/7 plan are not going to rob the bank...

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.virgin.net/">http://www.virgin.net/</A>&gt;

you could also check the archives for other posters thoughts at:

&lt;<A HREF="http://lowendmac.com/lists/mac-uk.shtml">http://lowendmac.com/lists/mac-uk.shtml</A>&gt;

By the way there is no minimum time period needed with Virgin should she
need to go earlier or move, etc...(BT and some others sometimes have 12
month min contracts!

One does indeed pay per minute for telephone calls here but if she only has
the line rental and calls the right number given by Virgin (or others) then
the rate will only be charged according to the plan chosen,ie if flat rate
24/7  the total fee for surfing all month would come to 9 GBP + 14 GBP = 23
GBP...(granted at 56k)

I have been with them for 18 months and have not been disappointed
yet...They also support mac users should something arise with setting it all
up...(and no I am not working for them or paid to recommend them).

Hope this helps

Richard
