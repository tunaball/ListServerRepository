I was the first kid on my block to download and install the update on 
Tuesday before it was pulled. I installed it on my desktop G4 and saw 
no problems. I installed it on my iBook and got problems. The first 
thing I noticed was a bunch of generic icons on the desktop. Those 
seemed to have figured out who they are in the intervening days. The 
biggest problem, however, was with DHCP IP serving. It kept showing an 
IP, but saying it was self-served. Coincidentally, I was having 
simultaneous issues with Cox Communications (my ISP) because I had just 
moved and they had me turned off instead of transferred. It took awhile 
to figure out that it was two problems at work: 10.2.8 and Cox. 
Finally, got everything back Wednesday morning.

I ran the permissions fix and both the G4 and the iBook and it fixed a 
bunch, and I mean a whole bunch, of permissions. Things seem to be 
working now. From now on, however, I'm going to give Apple at least 24 
hours before I download and install any updates.
