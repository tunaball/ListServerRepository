Subject: airport problem


I sent my iBook in for repair the first time because the screen was 
going blank when I opened it more than a few inches. Got it back - 
they'd replaced the following part:   600-8601 ASSY, INVERTER/SLEEP.

Well - I opened the box, started it up, it appeared to work okay for a 
few minutes. Before I'd sent it, I had a good strong wireless signal - 
from all over my house and even out in the yard. NOW - upon return from 
repair, I had almost no ability to pick up a wireless signal though 
(Airport card, Linksys router) even though router is working fine - 
have several other computers picking up signal, no problem. Before I 
had time to get TOO worried over that - had just started to call tech 
support to ask them to help me out - suddenly, within 20 minutes WHILE 
I was on the phone to tech support (remember - this is about 20 minutes 
after getting my computer back from apple's repair service),  the 
screen went all crazy with colors and lines jumping all over. Went 
through some stuff with tech support - during which the screen went 
totally blank and we couldn't get it to come back at all -  and sent it 
back for a second repair.  DID tell them about the signal problem, too 
and they made a note of it in the case notes.

Just got it back a few minutes ago. Says they have replaced the logic 
board, this time. So far display seems fine. The wireless signal 
problem is still there though.

My problem is this - I have cable modem with a router that has worked 
great - signal pretty good all over our small house. The place I often 
sit with my iBook in my lap has had a nearly 100 percent signal. 
Nothing has changed - the signal to the rest of the computers in the 
house(all farther away than where I usually sit with my iBook) is still 
the same as it has been, nothing has been moved.

But - my newly-returned iBook is not picking up ANY signal in my usual 
location. Zero. In fact, I have to get within about 4 feet of the 
router before it picks up any signal at all.

Apple Tech Support - been on the phone with them already -- says that 
they can't help me because I don't have an apple base station, I have a 
linksys wireless router, so they can't know if it is a router problem 
or airport card problem or a problem with my computer.

HELP?? To connect to the internet, I now have to STAND and hold my 
iBook up close to the router that is sitting on top of a bookshelf.

800 Mhz white ibook running OS 10.2.6.
