<PRE>&gt;<i>What can i do with imovie? Can i use a digital camcorder and make videos? 
</I>&gt;<i>Can someone tell of all the stuff you can do with imovie, and iphoto. I 
</I>&gt;<i>have on idea. Thanks josh

Josh:

Yes, iMovie can be used with a digital camcorder that has a FireWire 
connection. It can also be used with some analog-to-digital video capture 
devices. You can use iMovie to edit movies, add effects, incorporate 
stills, and more. It can then output the movie to a digital camcorder or 
a QuickTime file. If you have a G4, you can use iDVD to make DVDs from 
those movies. If you have Roxio's Toast, you can also make Video CDs, 
which _most_ DVD players can also show. A video CD runs about an hour max 
and can use regular CD-R media, rather than the more expensive DVD-R 
media. 

iPhoto does two basic things: it grabs digital photos from cameras (you 
usually don't need a special driver for the camera, though some cameras 
might) and lets you make albums, slideshows, and the like. It has some 
basic editing capability, as well, but you'd be well advised to get 
something like Photoshop Elements 2 or one of Microfrontier's products if 
you want to do more. 

It's a little much to expect people here to tell you &quot;all the stuff you 
can do with iMovie.&quot;
iMovie comes with a tutorial and an extensive help system. There are also 
some very good books on the subject and that's where you should turn 
next. You can find these at Amazon.com and often at Mac dealers and 
larger bookstores locally. Some examples:

- The Macintosh iLife: An Interactive Guide to iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, 
and iDVD
by Jim Heid (This is a good place to start; it's not expensive and it 
comes with a DVD of software, examples, and other neat stuff.)

- iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD Bible
by Bob LeVitus, Dennis R. Cohen 

- iMovie 2: The Missing Manual
by David Pogue

- iMovie 3 for Mac OS X (Visual QuickStart Guide)
by Jeff Carlson 

- iPhoto 2: The Missing Manual 
by David Pogue, et al) 

- iPhoto 2 for Mac OS X: Visual QuickStart Guide
by Adam C. Engst


Go to www.amazon.com and search in the books using &quot;iMovie&quot; in the title 
and you'll find all of these and more.
