</I>Netscape is a great example of how good software goes bad. New code is added
to old and new features are added at such a break neck pace that old code
isn't debugged before the new features are added in. And if that isn't bad
enough, C++, the programming language it (and most modern software) is
itself a terrible kluge.

What you are witnessing is called a memory leak. All programs request memory
allocation to perform a task. When that task is finished the memory is
supposed to be returned to the computer. However, that doesn't always happen
(programmer error) so the program uses more and more memory until - BOOM.
That's why Mac operating systems prior to OS X and Windows operating systems
prior to Win2k became less stable during the day and required period
rebooting.

If you are using Jaguar (10.2) you might want to try out Safari. Mozilla
(the open source version of Netscape) is also pretty decent.

All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by frost.
