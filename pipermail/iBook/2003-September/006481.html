</I>The external drive mounted so it was obviously formatted. I think the issue
about formatting is to make sure the drive is empty before using CCC. I
maintain a lab of OS X machines and I used CCC to roll out Jaguar and a host
of updates before the semester began. On my first attempt to clone to the
external firewire, CCC froze. I decided it might be a memory leak so I
copied the drive in two passes rather than one. That worked and I did the
same when I copied that clone to my 29 other machines. Four times during the
day CCC froze during the process of copying the clone to the other machines.
I think it is just the nature of the beast. I'm now evaluating commercial
software for cloning since, besides freezing, CCC is also quite slow.

If you are just backing up (as opposed to cloning a bootable drive) give
Deja Vu a look. It is configured using a system preference pane and can be
set up to copy any folder to another location - including a CD or DVD. You
can create manual backups but it also allows daily, weekly, and monthly
scheduled backups at a specific time. I use it now on both my iBook and
desktop for backing up data.
