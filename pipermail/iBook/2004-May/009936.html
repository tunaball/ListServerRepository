<PRE>I, too, find these messages extremely irritating, and somebody needs 
to give the subscriber a heads-up that it is just plain rude to 
subject a whole list to these. (I'm giving them the benefit of the 
doubt and assuming they're just clueless and not aware of their faux 
pas.)

But I don't think it's an email address harvesting scheme . . . or if 
so, they're very slow about it, because the address I use for the 
list doesn't (yet) get spam. That said, I'm going to start removing 
my &quot;real&quot; email address from my sig, just in case.

And I know it's frustrating, but it's no more a violation of our 
civil rights than when an executive has his mail opened by a 
secretary. This service is authorized by the subscriber to handle 
their incoming email.

What I wonder is whether the subscriber realizes how much email they 
never see. Have they *ever* gotten an iBook list post? If so, it's 
probably only a handful, and the subscriber must think this is the 
lightest-trafficked, most disjointed discussion list ever. Or maybe 
they get digests (does this list do digests?) and they're currently 
reading this post, shaking their head at how clueless the poor 
Suremail subscriber is. Heh.

What really bugs me is that the service doesn't indicate exactly 
*which* address they're buffering. Or maybe I'm missing an essential 
clue hidden in the headers? If somebody needs to give the subscriber 
a heads-up and/or unsubscribe them, how do you do that without their 
address?!
