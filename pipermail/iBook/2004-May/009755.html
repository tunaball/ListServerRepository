<PRE>&gt;<i> Don't leave us in suspense. What &quot;dedicated device&quot; did you buy? I 
</I>&gt;<i> bought a print server device (I forget the brand) that was advertised 
</I>&gt;<i> as working with Macs and PCs, but when I got it, the fine print on the 
</I>&gt;<i> box said it worked only with PostScript printers.
</I>
It was a D-Link DP311U, I think...cost about $120 through Amazon.com. 
(I believe this device will also work only with Postscript printers; 
but that wasn't a concern for me, since I only wanted to access a Laser 
Printer, anyway.)

It works, with a few caveats: you'll need your own Ethernet cable. And 
it works with the Mac, but the documentation is just *terrible,* and it 
required some common sense and luck to be able to set it up. (The 
documentation said to select the same channel as your wireless network, 
which didn't work; someone on the list suggested a different channel, 
and that's worked great.) It seems to need to be rebooted from time to 
time, for reasons unknown. (And you can't &quot;save&quot; the settings; they 
need to me manually entered if you do a &quot;factory&quot; reset.)

I could have left the computer on all the time, I suppose, but I just 
don't feel comfortable doing so; and this lets my wife share the 
printer through her PC without my having to sort out how to do that 
through OS X (though I understand it's possible).
