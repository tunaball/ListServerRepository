<PRE>Eric,

I have VPC 6.1 running on a 1.33ghz PowerBook with Panther. I have  
found it no slower than a real PC for a lot of things.

I gather that VPC 6 runs around 20-25% faster than previous versions

Do not use XP, these are slow to the point of being useless, guess it  
depends on if you really need it (XP) or not but I use Win 2000 and  
Autocad 2000 and a couple other programs that run only under Windose  
and nothing else and there are few programs with the same features. So  
far it has worked out fine. Load times are about the same as my old  
Celeron 666 and I have not had problems with strange things like your  
key problems.

I have a friend that has a 900mhz iBook and VPC 5 and it was slow under  
XP, so for most things he uses 98se. XP just needs to many resources.  
Heck, I have a desktop PC with XP and 1 gig of ram and it is still not  
happy and I find it slow at times.

Try to find VPC 6
