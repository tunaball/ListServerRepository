<PRE>I think that what I was asking is to go the other way, to use my Mac 
on a network of PC's to access a printer connected to a PC with 
printer sharing turned on. That printer can be accessed by anyone on 
the network but not by a Macintosh using anything up to Jaguar. I was 
told about 7 or 8 months ago that that problem would be solved with 
Panther. I haven't had the need to try again until now. Does anyone 
know if that projection was fulfilled, that a Mac could access a 
printer being shared off a connection to a PC?

GIMP Print is an opensource print driver. You can get it at 
sourceforge.net. That is a different issue. As I understand it, 
having GIMP Print on your macintosh should allow you to connect to 
and print from many, many different printers if you have the 
appropriate connectors. How do you use it?

&gt;&gt;<i>Another thing, I thought that GIMP Print would allow a Macintosh 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>print from nearly any computer that the iBook is attached to. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>tried that but can't seem to get it to work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If I understand you correctly, I think what you'll want to do is 
</I>&gt;<i>turn on Printer Sharing under System Preferences--&gt;Sharing--&gt;Printer 
</I>&gt;<i>Sharing. That allows you to share the Printers a computer is 
</I>&gt;<i>connected to over a network; I used to do this wirelessly with my 
</I>&gt;<i>iMac and iBook, but the iMac had to be active for it to work (which 
</I>&gt;<i>meant going downstairs and waking it from sleep mode), so I bought a 
</I>&gt;<i>dedicated device (one that allowed my wife's PC access, as well), 
</I>&gt;<i>instead.
