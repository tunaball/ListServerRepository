Don't leave us in suspense. What &quot;dedicated device&quot; did you buy? I 
bought a print server device (I forget the brand) that was advertised 
as working with Macs and PCs, but when I got it, the fine print on the 
box said it worked only with PostScript printers. I was trying to make 
it work with an Epson 5700i--which never wanted to work with any 
OS-X--and finally gave up. I ended up buying a Brother 1440 and it 
works like a champ with Panther. I leave the computer it is connected 
to (USB) on all the time and don't let it go into sleep mode so that 
the printer is available to others in the house through printer 
sharing, and so the cpu can do its late-night maintenance. But, if your 
solution works better, i would be happy to hear about it.
