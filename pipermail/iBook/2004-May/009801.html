<PRE>I have to agree that the new iBooks lack the instant recognition that 
the clamshells had. The Clamshells were a great design though a bit on 
the large side but then so were most portables back then too. They were 
unique and really stood out.

I do like the new iBook's but they don't stand out as much. I just 
bought a new Book but I went with a 12&quot; G4 1.33ghz PowerBook. So far I 
really like it. I originally bought last years model for a really good 
price but the new ones came out only 4 days later so I took it back and 
got one of the new ones, faster, larger video ram (64meg) and 
superdrive. Westworld in Calgary did it without any problems. I thought 
about ordering from Apple but in the end I decided that I would help 
support local business and I have always had great service from them.

Yes I think the latch design is too light and will have to be careful 
with it and I agree that it would have been really nice without a latch 
but in interest of size etc I can see the reasoning with the new 
designs....
