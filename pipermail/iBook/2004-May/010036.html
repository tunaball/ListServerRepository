</I>Hi:

I also own a Dell laptop and have no complaints about it.  I just 
prefer to work with my iBook for most things.  I keep them, the iBook 
and the Dell, both away and treat them like they were made of glass.  I 
can't comment on the G3 durability with the comments that I have read 
on this site or Apple's expansion of the Logic Board failure to include 
what seems to be the last batch of G3 iBooks.

Forgive me if I seem ignorant.  But to discuss the shortcomings of the 
G3 iBook is a sore point with many people.  If I may add, the 
difference in your explanation of Apple's handling of your G4's problem 
and the current G3 issue is that G4s are still being produced by Apple. 
  Apple response with respect to the G3 occurred while the G3 was being 
phased out.

David
