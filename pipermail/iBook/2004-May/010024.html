<PRE>This is my 3rd time in 14 months that I've had to send in my 900mhz G3 
iBook Combo Drive under Apple Warranty (and now extended AppleCare 
Warranty this time). First time, main logic board and drive replaced, 
2nd time, logic board replaced, this time, the screen will work for 
about 30 minutes after I've powered it up after being unplugged and 
battery removed over night, and then the screen will have strange small 
bits of &quot;TV like snow&quot; go across it, like it is short circuiting, and 
then it'll go blank. I can still access the keyboard and hit the power 
key and the &quot;R&quot; key to restart it, so I think it is display specific 
this time, but who knows. I've purchased 5 computers from Apple since 
1987, and dozens for my employers as technology coordinator in the 
newsprint industry, and I would say my own personal iBook has been my 
worst experience. I don't know if it is a heat issue (or issues) that 
causes this particular book to wear out more often or what. I know that 
there have been Apple Knowledge base articles on the 12&quot; PowerBook, 
that says to avoid using soft cloth like surfaces (like the edge of 
your hotel bed, for example) for your PowerBook (and I'm wondering if 
it the same with the 900mhz G3 models), as it doesn't let the heat 
dissipate, which I don't do too often anyways, and when I need too, I 
usually put my iBook to sleep when it starts getting a bit warm in such 
cases, or when I'm using it outside on a warm/hot summer day. Anyone 
notice or have experience whether the 14&quot; iBooks run any cooler? Does 
the G4 models run significantly hotter (considering the G4 is 
considered a much more heat producing chip)?


I'm curious whom on this list holds the &quot;record&quot; for the number of 
times a particular iBook has been sent into Apple for Warranty repair 
(and I count Extended AppleCare as warranty repair too, or any 
recalls).

Joe
