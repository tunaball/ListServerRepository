<PRE>Just plug in the camera, and see what it does. I bought a new Casio QRV  
4 megapixel digital and it came with a software cd that was supposed to  
be OSX. I tried installing the software from the cd and it did not work  
right. In the end I deleted it and just plugged the camera in and  
turned it on, started iPhoto and found the camera without any problems.  
I just made the switch from a Clamshell iBook to a brand new Powerbook  
and it found the camera without any problems.

For a password have you tried hitting the return? when I was at the  
dealers store he did just that when asked for a password and later I  
changed it to what I wanted. Failing that you could set up a new user  
with admin rights and it would let you set the password to anything you  
want. Later on you could delete the other user (after you have copied  
all the info.
