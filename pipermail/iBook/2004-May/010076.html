<PRE>I don't use iPhoto much, but is it possible that you had some files
in Trash from other stuff you had done?  And that's what the alert
message was talking aobut?  I recall there was a discussion about
apparent accidental deletion of iPhoto images on some mailing list
I read (I would guess this iBook list or the tiBook list), and it
turned out that the delete involved was just of some aliases, and
the original files were still where iPhoto actually keeps them.
The discussion was maybe a couple of months ago?  Also try a Google
search, maybe on &quot;iPhoto&quot; &quot;deletion&quot; &quot;recovery&quot; or something like
that, I vaguely recall that the discussion mentioned the problem
wasn't uncommon.
