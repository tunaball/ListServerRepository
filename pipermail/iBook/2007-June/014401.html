<PRE>Well Pat for not having the correct subject line, you have seemed to  
have opened one of the biggest threads lately. I say put what you  
want. The more descriptive the better, but sometimes everything seems  
to be so messed up, all you can do is send up a flare and say help.

It could be anything and usually when your frustrated and it could be  
everything that is wrong, you just ask for help. Heck I read you post  
right off, from the response I figured you were being blasted. Just  
ask the best you can, you may get blasted, but usually someone helps  
you off list is what I have found works when someone gets slammed.  
Sometimes On, just depends on the the group and how the members treat  
new people who are not in the same line widget line.

&quot;Of all the enemies to public liberty war is, perhaps, the most to be  
dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other  
war. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes;  
and armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for  
bringing the many under the domination of the few.&quot;
