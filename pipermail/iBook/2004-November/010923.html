<PRE>I am trying to rebuild a 500 MHZ snow white dual USB iBook, with 640 
MB RAM and airport. It was mine before I sold it to my office 
colleague, but, I am having trouble with the rebuild. The machine has 
original disks with 10.1 and software restore seems to have no 
trouble and it ran Jag for a long time before I sold it and after I 
sold it. But after I sort of wiped it and started a new account for 
my colleague I couldn't get the internet to work.

Now, with 10.1, the internet worked, but when I tried to upgrade to 
Jag, it would stop during the installation with multiple problems. I 
erased the disk and reinstalled a couple of times with similar 
results. Before reinstalling I tried repairing the disks with disk 
utility and DiskWarrior, but the first couple of times it didn't work 
and could not complete the repair.

Finally, I erased the disk again, and then I started straight from 
the Jaguar installation disk. Same problems. It would hang on the 
second installation disk. Then I started up in Panther from my 
firewire drive after completing the first installation disk and 
repaired permissions and ran DiskWarrior and finally it loaded both 
disks and now have Jag installed. But still the internet ethernet 
connection and airport connection doesn't work (remember it did in 
10.1).

When I try to restart the computer, it gets a kernel panic and stops 
about 2 out of 3 times. The other time it starts.

I can't find anything like the old internet setup assistant that I 
used to run through when I had connection troubles before either.

Any idea what is going on? Any suggestions?

Thanks.
