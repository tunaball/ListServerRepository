Bob--

I had similar difficulities upgrading to Panther from 10.2.6 with my 
G3/800. I ran every diagnostic I could find, like Disk First Aid and 
Disk Warrior, even the scary (for me) fsck -y. Despite the Apple 
Hardware Test passing everything several times, when an authorized Mac 
tech (I wasn't nervy enough to open this myself) pulled the 3rd party 
ram module (installed by MCE Technologies), and I stood there and 
installed 10.3, all was well. When the tech pulled the ram module, he 
said it looked compatible, but it sure didn't work in 10.3. I then 
purchased a new ram module to max out the ram (128 is just not 
sufficient). Shorty after I was upgrading, there were lots of reports 
on this list and elsewhere about 10.3 being finicky about ram, so it's 
the first thing to suspect.

If your tech friend is nearby, ask him to pull the extra ram, and see 
what happens installing Panther with just the built-in.

If you don't want to try pulling the extra ram just yet, try creating 
another user with Administrative privileges, and keep it 
pristine--don't add any system altering stuff (like things from 
Unsanity) or startup items--then see if the freezes continue. If it 
works okay, then maybe there's something about the way you have your 
user configured that's causing the problem.
