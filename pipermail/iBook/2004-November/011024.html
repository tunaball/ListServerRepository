No experience with a Windows iPod on a Mac, but have played my iPod 
many hours through my car stereo. Note that I said &quot;played through&quot; as 
opposed to &quot;hooking it up&quot; as in your questions. I presently use the 
Griffin iTrip, but have also used the Belkin thingie. I like the iTrip 
because it gets its power from the iPod and doesn't need batteries. I 
used the Belkin device (can't remember its name) before I got the iTrip 
and it went through AAA batteries like crazy. I have another thing that 
plugs into the car accessory outlet (cigarette lighter) and plugs into 
the dock port on the iPod to power it while driving. I have looked at 
the Griffin RoadTrip online, but haven't seen it in stores yet. It's, 
essentially, a power dock and FM transmitter combined. The thing that 
makes it attractive is that it is hardware controlled to change the FM 
frequency. The iTrip is software controlled, which is almost impossible 
(and very unsafe) to change while driving--and is impossible to change 
without jumping out of the playlist, changing the frequency, and then 
going back to where you left off. When traveling a long distance, I 
like to put together a very long playlist, put it on shuffle, and let 
it go. If I have to change frequencies, there's no way to get back to 
where you  left off. The RoadTrip (or so I understand), has 
push-buttons to move up and down the frequencies. Of course, the best 
way to hook up your iPod to your vehicle is to buy a new BMW.
