Bill Moyer got bounced for pointing out that Bush mispoke when he 
called the hijackers cowards. I guess he didn't realize that 'coward' 
is what grade school boys use to insult each other, they don't yet know 
the exact meaning of the word. Knee jerk hot heads were all over him 
for that. I guess that they didn't listen to what he said.

Even worse is to hear Bush speak about the principles of our founding 
father's in the Lott incident. I guess he didn't know that they were 
all slave owners, that the country had survived on owning slaves for 
several hundred years before the traitorous terrorists held the Boston 
Tea Party and other acts of rebellion. And for at least another 100 
years after the creation of the US based on the principles of the 
founding fathers, slavery was both supported by Congress and the 
Supreme Court. On this date in 1865 Congress FINALLY abolished Slavery 
via the 13th Ammendment. Slavery was abolished but segregation and 
racism continued. About 100 years later the Civil Rights Act finally 
gave minorities equal rights. Two years ago, tens of thousands were 
prevented from voting or had their votes lost.

What was done to the so called Indians was genocidal.
