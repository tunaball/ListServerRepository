<PRE>Several people here have OS X on their iBooks - I have a weird problem 
that perhaps someone can help me with that I think MIGHT be related to 
X and my iBook.

I upgraded to X about a week ago. Since X was installed, my cordless 
phone, which sits near my computer, has been acting up. If I'm on the 
phone, the dial tone will sound - seven quick tones, as if the phone is 
trying to dial up something automatically. Without a dial tone, nothing 
happens, and I can keep talking.

  If I'm off the phone, I know the dial tone is still going off, because 
on random occasions when I pick up the phone, I hear the sound of a 
modem trying to connect with something. After a while, if I leave the 
phone off the hook, the line reverts back to normal and I get a dial 
tone.

I don't have a fax machine, although I have fax software in my 
computer, at least under System 9. It has not been enabled, ever since 
I got my iBook. Furthermore, no phone line is plugged into either 
computer - we've been connected to the Web via cable modem for the past 
few years. I'm networked to my daughter's computer via ethernet 
connection.

Thinking OS X and my iBook had something to do with this, I have moved 
the phone's base unit from my office - a foot or so from my iBook - to 
my daughter's room. Result: for the past few hours, no dial modem 
sound, and no dial tones while I'm on the phone.

Any ideas what could have caused the auto dialing?  Is OS X and my 
iBook sending out dial tones somehow that my phone is picking up? I 
don't have airport, remember.

Dave
