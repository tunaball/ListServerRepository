I've always loved Apple ads. I think they are high class mind 
manipulation that leaves people aroused. After 16 years of consulting, 
I find myself laughing at some of the switcher ads knowing how many 
bumbed out people are going to be frustrated that they can't pick up 
their camera, plug one end of the cable into it and the other end of 
the cable into the Mac and download their photos. This won't happen to 
everyone but there will be a lot of people who have problems doing so. 
Sadly, for me, I no longer have much interest in being a consultant and 
trying to resolve all of the little pesky problems that pop up since OS 
X is going to be a gold mine for consultants. Maybe I am being drawn 
more to using my computer personally rather than as a consultant. OS X 
is so darn nice...  I am only running X and all of my apps are native.

My Presidential Campaign Begins: My first proposal is that a personal 
computer remains just that, personal, and that no company or person has 
any right to place, without informed permission, any software on that 
which would infringe on its security or privacy.
