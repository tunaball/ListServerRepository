<PRE>Jack:

	That's intersting. I know they burn the fields in Cuba, too, but the 
cane there is cut about six inches above the ground and only replanted 
when it gets too old. I had a great-uncle years ago in Ocala who grew 
cane and had a mill, but I think the weather has changed sufficiently 
(and the economics) too preclude growing it anywhere north of 
Okeechobee. I've never spent much time south of Orlando. I went to 
Hollywood once with my dad when I was a kid and spent a couple of days 
in Palm Beach with a friend. The sugar lobby is probably one of the 
most-powerful in Florida.
