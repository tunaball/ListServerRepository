The intent of affirmative actions was not to provide special benefits 
but to see that people were not being denied an equal opportunity. So 
many people ignore the special benefits they are already receiving by 
not being the minority being discriminated against. It's very difficult 
for those who have had a fast track to success, college, jobs, 
promotions because they are white that others have been denied these 
same opportunities simply because they are black, not because they lack 
abilities, skills or talents.

I think the different treatment he was discussing was discrimination, 
lynching and so on. Quite a bit different than affirmative action and 
if I have my facts straight, was not a fact until long after his murder.

</I>
Not very relevant to the topic discussed...
