<PRE>You can determine if something you have installed is a problem maker by 
creating a new user account and setting that account for the login 
account and then rebooting. This will create a new clean set of 
preferences.

If the problems disappear, then something is wrong in your original 
startup user account. If the problems persist you need to do what I did:

Erase the drive. Install Jaguar. Run fsck. Run Diskwarrior. Run the 
permissions fixer utility. Try some of the installed Jaguar goodies. If 
everything is OK, move on to the first Apple updater and run the three 
utilities again. Check. If everything is ok, then install the third 
updater. Run the three utilities again.

At this point you either have an install that is working just fine or 
you are back to your problems. If you still have problems, it is 
probably time to call Apple.

If no problems, then install the Apple software and run the utilities 
again and check for performance. See previous paragraph.

Now find your install disks and do a fresh install of your commercial 
software. After each one, run some performance tests. Then run the 
three utilities to check your drive.

I would leave out any freeware and shareware software for a while if 
your drive is performing OK. Historically the installation of this type 
of software has eventually led to problems, but not always. If you feel 
you must instal certain applications do so under controlled conditions 
and test to see if they cause any problems.

If you install MS Office, there is a good chance that it may cause some 
problems and you need to run a few updaters and do some research on 
various lists and faqs.

The US Army is destroying 31,500 tons of nerve agents and highly toxic 
blister agents at a projected cost of $24 Billion Dollars. Someone 
suggested they could make money selling it on eBay under the Weapons of 
Mass Destruction category.
