I did a Google search on Limbaugh and found several references to his 
devotion to macs. What surprised me was George W. Bush was mentioned as 
a mac devotee (MacCentral). Well, he's got the money, but he just seems 
like a MS platform type.
I'm into Apple's advertising/marketing, especially the print ads. I 
don't know if the &quot;Switch&quot; ads have produced the numbers they want, but 
the campaign is going on and on, so perhaps so.
Charles mentions a campaign with famous writers, which I think would 
work, but only if coupled with film and television celebrities and God 
knows there are a ton of them out there who use and love macs.
