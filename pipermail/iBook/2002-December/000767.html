<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Paul Bernhardt &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">pbern10 at xmission.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't take it personally. Just because people disagree with you doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> mean they think you are lying or that you don't know what you are
</I>&gt;<i> talking about. They just think you are mistaken. Being mistaken is a
</I>&gt;<i> common human condition which I often suffer from, and probably you, 
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You make an excellent point, Paul.

Nobody is saying BJ is lying. I'm saying IGM are lying, but BJ has no 
association with them that I know of other than just reporting that 
they ran an article. Besides, even if I think he's mistaken in his 
conclusions (which I do), how is even THAT his fault when he's being 
fed false information by IGM?

&gt;<i> With that said, The article is talking about Ellen Fleis ad which never
</I>&gt;<i> (AFAIK) ran on TV.
</I>
I've seen it on television, so yes it has run on TV. Usually late at 
night ... can't imagine why ... ;)

&gt;<i> Also, I don't think Apple has said that all the ads in the Switcher
</I>&gt;<i> campaign are of people who switched, per se. Many are of such people,
</I>&gt;<i> of course. But, some are of people who have used Macs for years. The
</I>&gt;<i> Switcher ads, therefore, are not so much ads of people who switched,
</I>&gt;<i> but ads designed to show people that switching is viable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>1. All the stories in the ads are a) true and b) phrased in the 
person's own words (no script).

2. Not all the stories directly related to switching from PC to Mac. 
Hamilton Morris never mentions a computer at all, he just talks about 
the iPod. Janie Porche never mentions having owned a PC, just that her 
Mac kicks her dad's lame PC all over the map. And De La Soul ... er, 
what ARE they talking about?? :)
