</I>That seems very strange. I have the quite contrary experience. 10.2.2 has by
far the most stable file system that I have dealt with. In fact, I have had
a few corruptions on earlier OS's (9, 10.1) on my iBook, but those were
dealt perfectly with by fsck or especially Disk Warrior, but still no
problems at all on my 10.2 machines, where I even do an fsck once in a while
to be sure everything is alright. For that matter, I have not formatted my
hard drive on my iBook since the got it two years ago (I made 3 partitions
on that day back then, though).

You don't spend much time telling about what kind of applications you are
using and you don't say much about how full your drive is. Those two things
could be related to your troubles, but it could also be a hardware error of
course. 

To me it seems unrelated to the OS.

Just my 2 cents
