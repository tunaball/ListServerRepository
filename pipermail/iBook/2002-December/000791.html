<PRE>&gt;<i> From: &quot;Eric B. Richardson&quot; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">lbyron at comcast.net</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So if you didn't think he was an idiot before, you know he is one now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _Chas_
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm... I have heard Rush talk about Mac many times over the years, I
</I>&gt;<i> have *never* IIRC, heard him say that Apple's sales would quadruple
</I>&gt;<i> overnight using his program. Perhaps you could furnish that quote,
</I>&gt;<i> including date and time?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sure thing! But first, just a reminder: not everything Rush says 
happens on his program. This quote actually came from a column on his 
web site, on or around July 19th, 2002.

And incidentally, after looking up the quote I find I must apologise 
for slight exaggeration. Rush merely claimed he could DOUBLE Apple's 
sales, not quadruple them. I misremembered. Mea culpa.

Here's the MacNN story on the article (note the link to the original 
article is now dead):
<A HREF="http://www.macnn.com/news.php?id=15425">http://www.macnn.com/news.php?id=15425</A>

Rush's site itself is most unhelpful at finding the original article, 
but as you can see from the comments of Rush supporters on the MacNN 
forum attached to the story, there's no doubt that the original article 
did exist.

&gt;<i> If you can do that, and I bet you can't
</I>
I win ... again.

&gt;<i> , can you tell us how you know
</I>&gt;<i> that that is what he really believes will happen, as opposed to using
</I>&gt;<i> rhetorical exaggeration to emphasize a point?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I have to on just the quote from the MacNN story and my (admittedly 
fuzzy) memory of the original article. He basically said that because 
he has such a large audience and that they basically do whatever he 
tells them to, an advertising contract with EIB (his show) would double 
Apple's market percentage in extremely short order.

&gt;<i> Just because you disagree with someone does not make them an idiot
</I>
You're absolutely right. I have many friends who are conservatives and 
none of them are idiots. I'm giving YOU the time of day, clearly I 
don't think YOU'RE an idiot either.

But when one has a long record of lying in public, refusing to 
acknowledge it when they are caught, when one holds racist views, when 
one deliberately distorts their opponents' record in order to make 
their own point look better, I feel safe in calling that person an 
idiot regardless of their political views. Rush Limbaugh is an idiot. 
Trent Lott is an idiot. James Trafficant (a Democrat) and Gary Condit 
(also a Democrat) are both idiots AND slimeballs. There is plenty of 
idiocy on display in this world.

&gt;<i> But making such a readily demonstrable false judgement
</I>&gt;<i> does reflect poorly as to your level of intolerance for opposing
</I>&gt;<i> viewpoints.
</I>
Oops. Here, I'll heat up that crow for you. Makes it easier to swallow.
