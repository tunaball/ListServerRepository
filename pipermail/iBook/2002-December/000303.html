I paid a bit more for the Dimage but then again I got a few hours time 
with the sales woman who answered quite a few questions and I got to 
return a Nikon that wasn't working right. I like the Dimage better.

I saved $600 on a GL2 just by asking if they could match B&amp;H or Profeel 
or Zotz,  which took me about 15 minutes to look up. They camera will 
undoubtedly drop as much as $400 more dollars over they next few years 
and especially so when the GL3 is getting ready to ship. But by then I 
will have shot a few hundred tapes and made much more than $400 do so.

Generally the best price is when a new model is about to ship and the 
mfg is offering rebates and the prices are really cut. But then you 
have to mentally adjust to the fact that you have the number two model.
