Earthlink is actually offering Verizon Wireless's Express Network (3G) using
a Sierra Aircard 555, which, as far as I have been able to determine, won't
work on even Macs with PC card slots.

VZW offers a $99/mo unlimited, megabyte and some plans that just measure by
time, starting at $35/mo for 150 minutes. I agree, it's still more expensive
than I am willing to pay for, even with my employee discount. When it was
first introduced, you could get it on any plan for an additional $35/month
and usage was measured in airtime, not megabytes which was pretty cool.

I don't think that it's selling to the general public as well as the company
would like (big with corporate clients, though) so prices may come down but
I'm not holding my breath.
