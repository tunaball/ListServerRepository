OK, sounds like something is corrupt in the program. This USED TO BE 
SIMPLE TO RESOLVE but for the moment OS X has many of us consultants 
wondering what to do.

So, let's get REAL SERIOUS....

First verify that your USB port and your cable are OK. Then...

Do a search for 'capture' on your drive.

Using Jaguar.2 I find FOUR .plist files, an alias and the application, 
an extensions, a scripting addition. an ImageCapture.framework folder...

About 13 files and folders to deal with.

The following may preceed your designer to install Jaguar...   :)

I would try, with my fingers crossed, deleting every file and folder 
that relates to Image Capture and then doing the pacifist install.

One thing that I have found is that files moved to the trash with 
Command+Delete often are not removed from the working system. Jaguar 
has continued to reference files in the trash, at least one, until I 
emptied the trash. So, empty the trash and even shutdown, wait a few 
minutes and then restart. This little superstitious suggestion is meant 
to clear the memory banks.

Now try your reinstall of IC. If it doesn't work I'll give you 50 bucks 
for the desktop mac if you'll pay for the shipping.

So, my experience is evolving into recognizing that deleting one 
preference file may not be enough and the trash must be emptied and 
even the computer shutdown just for safety sake.

How about a switcher ad for adding software, installing a printer or 
any other action which requires a password...that you don't remember...
