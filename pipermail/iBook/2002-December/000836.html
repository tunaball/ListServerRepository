That would be a good example. Bill Maher was canned for that but in 
reality it was just an excuse to end his failing misery early. I 
don't think he should have been canned on that though, he has a right 
to say what he wants. But if he was wildly popular, he wouldn't have 
been canned for that. Bill Moyers, for instance, won't be canned, he 
is way too popular and makes money from the audience of public tv and 
npr, even though some of his statements are nearly as inane and 
obnoxious.

Committing suicide is nearly always the cowards out, and it was in 
this case as well. They didn't ever face up to their choices, nor to 
real opposition to their values. So it would depend on how you define 
coward, but men who hide their beliefs, then kill thousands of 
unarmed civilians in a supposed war, and kill themselves in the 
process, so that they never face up to their crimes, pretty much 
defines the word for me.

Yes, they were called American armed services personnel overseas. But 
you want every vote to count don't you?


&gt;<i>What was done to the so called Indians was genocidal.

Agreed.
