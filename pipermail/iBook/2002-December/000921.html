One of these days, it might be interesting to visit the planet you're 
talking about. Meanwhile, back on Earth, this is not the case, especially 
if you take a sociological view rather than look at any given individual. 
How anyone can say that discrimination by race does not exist is beyond 
me.

&gt;<i> As a WASP, it was very difficult for me to find

Right. Like it's that simple. Apologize and go on. This is an example of 
the &quot;simple answers to complex questions&quot; mentality that qualifies as my 
pet political peeve. That's just as likely to work as &quot;Just say no&quot; is 
likely to solve the drug problem (or the &quot;war on drugs&quot; for that matter).

I'm not saying that various Affirmative Action programs are perfect, but 
to dismiss them out of hand with the above argument is simplistic and, I 
think disengenuous. Social and political problems are not solved by 
looking at one side of the story, despite the very vocal protestations of 
many conservative Republicans to the contrary.

&gt;<i>and focus on
</I>&gt;<i>the real issues that divide our country, like computer platform. ;^)

Or OS X vs. OS 9.x . . .
