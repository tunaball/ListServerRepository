I am not sure but I think when you use a chat app it does not grant them
access to your computer, rather has a protocol that displays this
information graphically in such a manner, and is simply sending and
receiving information in packages similar to those used in email or surfing?

If I understand it correctly using a chat app is like any other network
protocol (standardized and built up in predetermined layers) in that it will
be sent and received using a certain port...the same as when you check mail
or browse the internet but the port numbers may be different and the
protocol may be different (I don't know). Finally I think the frequency of
exchange of information respectively the reception of information is greater
therefore the chances of someone using this port and protocol for less than
honourable purposes is higher? Then the attacker can attach his items to
your message and it comes in through this port or at least detects which
port it should use to attack? I also could imagine that the ports used for
chats are those that are notorious for attacks? The concern is still present
in the Linux world when it comes to chat apps...and should be with OS X as
well for that matter...anytime you use the internet you should take measures
to protect your computer and privacy...

Having said that I'll preach what I don't do...inform yourself what ports
your chat app (and others) use and how the protocols are built up, use a
firewall and exercise caution...especially in these days of &quot;always on
connections&quot;

HTH,

Richard
