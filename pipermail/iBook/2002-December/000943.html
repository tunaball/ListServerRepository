I have been watching and photographing the process. And the images have 
been stored on an iBook and I am now transfering them to DVD for backup.

The growing of cane is quite organized. A great portion of the 
Everglades has been converted to cane farms. The process involves 
staggering the planting of the cane so that there is a constant supply 
for the mills. You could visualize this as the fields being planted in 
the months of a clock and the 1 oclock fields are harvested in January, 
etc.

The cane is removed completely and the fields are replanted. You can 
drive down Highway 27 and see large fires of in the distance. I joke 
with myself and say the fires are bigger on the weekend when the 
pollution people are off for the weekend. Sometimes the air is quite 
thick with smoke.

I stayed in Clewiston one weekend, The Sweetest City on Earth, and got 
a few nice shots of the smoke stacks puffing away. Large chunks of ash 
fell on my car. People's noses are stuffed from the smoke...
