I got a Soyo <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ibook.html">Cig at r</A> 128MB. It was $68 six months ago from 
www.newegg.com. The prices were dropping and I thought that I might use 
whatever I got for a couple of years and then replace it, rather than 
go for the &quot;highest quality&quot;.

I have been pleased with its functionality. On Macs, you just plug it 
in and it shows up on the desktop, for either OS 9 or OS X. I was only 
able to change the default name under OS 9. It is somewhat slow to 
write to, but fast to read from.

I carry it in my pocket all the time, and it shows wear marks and the 
cap has chipped. In spite of that, it has worked well, is easy to use, 
and has made my life easier. I find it more reliable than trying to 
hook up to iDisk, which is sometimes slow, and will not work at all if 
my ISP is down, which has happened in the past but is more infrequent 
now.
