Hmnnn...well you COULD always wait for a &quot;better&quot; machine.  I guarantee you  you will be waiting  year  after year   because there will ALWAYS be a better one coming out.  
Nobody buys a Mac because they NEED it.  They buy a Mac because they DESERVE to have the best computer in the world. 
You know...there is no such thing as having too many computers in the house.
Until you own an iBook, you will not beleive how incredible it is  to pick it up and take it whereever you want to go...the library, the coffeeshop, a meeting (they are great to take minutes on).  Durable, sturdy, you NEED one.
And...should you take this machine back...well...some of us will pray for your soul.
There must have been a reason you bought it in the first place.  Did it speak to you from the shelf?  Open that box  and do the right thing!
               Paula, you can never have too many computers, Rutledge
