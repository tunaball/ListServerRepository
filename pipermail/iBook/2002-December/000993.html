Lot of people feel that way until they buy an icebook, then they soon 
forget...

Regarding your projector problem, these projectors use an lcd screen 
with a bright backlight and a lens. (Note: there may be a new model 
that does things differently.) Thus the lcd screen works much like a 
35mm slide or even movie film.

So, you need a cable that provides a connection similar to a monitor.  
I don't believe the earlier iBooks had this feature nor do I know when 
the feature first appeared.

I remember when I connected my Pismo to its first projector. I took 
possession of the cord (I unplugged it from the Mac it was connected to 
and plugged it into my Pismo during a break). My screen went black and 
I thought I had zapped it. I hit this key and that key until someone 
tapped on my shoulder and pointed to the large projection screen and 
there was my desktop. In a typical Mac fashion I really didn't have to 
do anything to make it work.

The US Army is destroying 31,500 tons of nerve agents and highly toxic 
blister agents at a projected cost of $24 Billion Dollars. Someone 
suggested they could make money selling it on eBay under the Weapons of 
Mass Destruction category.
