My paragraph stated that advertising is basically finding out what 
people don't like about a product and then telling them that it doesn't 
exist. Seems like this rebuttal from someone in advertising fits that 
definition quite emphatically.

&gt;<i> You may all now feel free to flame me to death.
</I>
Nope. Not me. But you might find me laughing myself to death.

Cigarette advertising was banned after all of those years of telling 
people how good cigarettes were for them. Hopefully sometimes soon 
alcohol ads will also be banned. Automobile ads features cars doing 
illegal things and convince and entice people to drive recklessly and 
dangerously.

Remember the collapse of the stock market recently. And the flood of 
ads proclaiming safety, profitabilty, wisdom, and good advice...all 
from people who were unable to show this to their clients who were 
loosing money hand over fist.

Outright lies? Fewer than in past years. But many, and Apple is in the 
front here, have learned how to pull chains and ring bells with ad copy 
that seems to promise so much but in effect promises little or is 
written so carefully and thus designed to be misleading but it is hard 
to prove otherwise.

How about a switcher ad for adding software, installing a printer or 
any other action which requires a password...that you don't remember...
