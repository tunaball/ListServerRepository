It's also worth noting that the talk shows are not news media, they 
are political entertainment. Somehow, liberals just can't be 
entertaining... wait a minute aren't the Smothers Brothers making a 
comeback? Who was the comedian that made a name on their show that 
ran for president? Did anyone ever see the commercial where he talked 
out of both sides of his mouth? Yep, liberals used to be 
entertaining, but somewhere they lost it. Even a guy with the ability 
to be funny as David Brenner used to be, can't make it very far when 
he talks politics.

Anyway, for real news media with a strong conservative bent, we have 
Fox, against ABC, CBS, PBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC. We have pretty nearly 
every major paper against the Wall Street Journal, the Washington 
Times, the Pittsburgh paper owned by Scaife, and it used to be the 
Sacramento Bee. For news mags, we have Newsweek and Time against 
what? Insight from the Washington Times? Hardly counts. The opinion 
and really investigative journals like Mother Jones against American 
Spectator, well that probably balances out, but then that is not the 
news media, is it?
