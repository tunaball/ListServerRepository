I bought one of the Apple 300 baud modems that plug directly into the 
wall much like the newest square power brick. Two days later, dead. 
Took it back and they gave me a new one. Two days later, dead. Same 
thing. Same thing. I finally insisted on getting one of the non-apple 
modems. No more problems.

Why?

Best guess, Apple's design was to be on 24 hours a day. The other 
modems had an off switch.

Our warehouse was in an area that suffered frequent blackouts and brown 
outs.

My guess is that the big surge following a black out was burning out 
the modems.

I haven't lost a piece of electronic gear since I began using UPS 
Backups. The surge protection seems to work.

Is your ABS connected to a UPS backup/surge protector?
