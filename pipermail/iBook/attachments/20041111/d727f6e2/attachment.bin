Thanks All for your help and suggestions.  Video chat requirements are
indeed G3/600 or better.  Audio requirements are 

	<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>▪</fontfamily> 	 Mac OS X
10.2.5 or later (Mac OS X 10.3 or later for iChat AV 2.1 or later)

	<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>▪</fontfamily> 	 Any PowerPC
G3 microprocessor or later

	<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>▪</fontfamily> 	 iSight, or
any microphone

	<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>▪</fontfamily> 	 56 kbit/s
modem connection

So looks like its worth mailing her the dongle & a mike and testing it.


Cheers

<excerpt>My daughter was happily using a Clamshell 366 at college, 
upgraded 

with 20G HD and 512 M RAM,  OS 10.3,  until she tried an audio chat 

with iChat.  No internal mike and no audio in port.  I was initially 

stumped, until I remembered I had this USB dongle buried in the bottom 

of a drawer.  I think it was made by Griffin. It looks to be
switchable 

between mike in and speaker out.  It seems like a possible solution.  

Has anyone had success with this and the Clamshells?

I have a 466MHz Clamshell iBook and the Griffin iMic USB dongle you
speak of.  It will let you use a mic with the iBook, but I'm pretty
sure you need at least a 600MHz G3 to use iChat AV (i.e. audio or
video Chat).  If I'm wrong, I'd sure like to know.  I know someone who
would be ecstatic to know they could use iChat AV for audio chat on a
500MHz G3 iMac.

Dave.
