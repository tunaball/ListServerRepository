My ibook battery started to not hold a charge very well either, after about a
year and a half.  Tried resetting the power manager, draining the battery fully
and then letting it recharge overnight, and even clean installing OSX,
considering that it seemed to start happening after installing X onto the
computer.  


But since I have Apple Care, I called them up and they sent me a new battery. 
and a new power adapter as well, since the old one wouldn't turn amber when
charging the battery.  Apple Care is more than on the way to paying for
itself.....

I have had my ibook for about a year and a half now and the battery has started
to not hold a charge at all. This is party due to the fact that I left it
plugged in for about a month as I used it as a clock radio and stereo at my
sisters house. Is there any sort of program like battery reset that will help
me, or resetting the power manager? Or maybe discharging the battery fully a few
times? Thanks
