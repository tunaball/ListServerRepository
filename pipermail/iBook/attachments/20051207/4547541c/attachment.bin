<excerpt><fontfamily><param>Courier</param><x-tad-bigger>When I
replaced the drive in my iBook I looked at

7200RPM drives and found that they would make the

laptop to hot. I ended up just getting a 5400RPM

instead. This is just my personal opinion, but unless

you absolutely need the speed increase i'd stay with

the 5400RPM drive.

When did you look at doing this Matt,? The reason I ask is that the
latest generation drives are said to be significantly cooler. I really
do need the speed increase! Some apps just don't work, however I need
it to remain quiet while I record, so a hot drive triggering the fan
isn't good either!
