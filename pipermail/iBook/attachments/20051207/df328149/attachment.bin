Have you considered an external hard disk? It's a lot cheaper,
performance is

better, and you won't have to modify your ibook.


I have this setup for recording on my 12" G4 800, and it works well.
Get a

casing without a fan, and you should be fine. I built a 160GB external
HD

(USB2/FW) for about AU$250 (~US$170), which is quite decent...


Caveat: if you use an external sound card, make sure the HD isn't on
the same

bus - my soundcard is USB, so I use the HD on firewire.


HTH,

-Angus

Hi Angus,

yes, the problem being a lack of USB 2 on the ibook and I do use a
firewire (Metric Halo) audio interface. Also, FW800 is a helluvalot
faster than 400 with external drives.

Cheers!

Steve
