I hate to top my own help post, but I know to look in the Mail
preferences, but somethings wrong and they don't seem to have them for
OS 10.3.9 and we tried lots of changes....

altho' many of my friends on PC's are having the same problems).  


Can anyone tell me where to look for both the settings for it and my
.Mac account (which I can receive from, but not send)?  Or maybe, if
someone has switched and has been successful using OS 10.3.9, could
send me screen shots of what I should do and apply?  I need both set
up straight.
