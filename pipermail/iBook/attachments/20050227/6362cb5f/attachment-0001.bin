a curiousity for us iBook owners looking to video conference with our
Windows long lost cousins.</fontfamily>


<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> My iBook is only a G3/500, so iChat
A/V will not let me hook up an iSight camera.</fontfamily>


<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> Now I <bold>have</bold> done video
many times in the Windows world, and these are the combinations that
seem to work:</fontfamily>


<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> AIM: You can do video if you are
running Windows XP only</fontfamily>

<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> MSN Messenger: You can do video if
you are running Windows 2000 or Windows XP</fontfamily>


<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> So...my questions are:</fontfamily>



	1.  	<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param>Will any generic USB or
Firewire camera work with my iBook 500 with iSight since Apple’s
iSight camera requires at least an iBook 600?</fontfamily>

	2.  	<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> I don’t see any video
conferencing option in Mac’s MSN Messenger (ver 4.0.1 currently), will
MSN Messenger for Mac do video?</fontfamily>

	3.  	<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> What have people found is the
best option for Mac to Mac video conferencing if you can’t use iChat
A/V?</fontfamily>

	4.  	<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> What have people found is the
best option for Mac to Windows video conferencing... MSN Messenger?
 AIM?  Is there a Windows version of iChat A/V?</fontfamily>

	5.  	<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> What potholes should I be
aware of?</fontfamily>



<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> Thanks!</fontfamily>
