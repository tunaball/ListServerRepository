Hi:


I'm sorry about the difficulties.  I have had luck with my two 12" G3
iBooks.  I try to run them equally, but I still gravitate to the
700Mhz iBook with the CD ROM for my mail using Mail X.


I think that the 900Mhz Combo drive get jealous, so I am running her
more often.


To the point, however, Apple should honor or do something to get you
along during those times without the laptop.  It just plain bad for
business to have someone like you de dissatisfied.  Apple should hold
up it's end to you satisfaction, instead of finger-pointing.  But I
sincerely doubt that you get any better products from any other
company, to be honest.  I have had problems that I have voiced with
other companies that produce supposedly quality products, but don't
have the quality support or worse, get treated like it was my fault.


Hang in there, and don't sell Apple too short.


David


PS:  I'm just an Apple fan and am not employed by any computer firm.

In less than 3 years I've gone through 3 G3 iBooks and 1 G4 'book.

Even as a user group president, I would not recommend anyone buy an
iBook.
