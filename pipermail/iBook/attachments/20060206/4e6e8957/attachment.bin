I'm new to this list, as you can see.

Within the last couple of months I bought myself a Clamshell iBook, I
don't know why exactly, except the man who I purchased my very first
Mac from told me that it's a tough little machine, that he's seen it
run over by a pick-up truck and revived !, so I really think it was
for that very reason., believe it or not, that I bought this !,  my
second thoughts were, I'm glad I did- it's a joy to use.

I do need some assistance though. It's got 7.6 GB's  left on it. If I
were to take O.S. 9 off would it free up those GB's ?, & too is it
advisable to remove this O.S. ? It came with 2 disks

of O.S 10.3 something, being that Panther is such a "road hog", I'm
wondering if this O.S. will deplete all of it's valuable GB's. or is
this was is meant to happen ?, Thanks, I hope I here from some of you
concerning this. 

Regards, Toni Seth

P.S. I hope this is a place to discuss such matters, & Please let me
know if it's not, if not where should I be talking about this ?</bigger></color></fontfamily>
