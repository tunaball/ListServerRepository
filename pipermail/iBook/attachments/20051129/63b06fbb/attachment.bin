He had me reboot the Airport Ex. (but not a hard reboot) and then
checked preferences and last, had me restart the computer.  Exact same
things I did on Sat., but perhaps in a different order.  It was fast
and quick.  The phone call on Sat. took almost 2 hours and the tech
told me to take it to the nearest Apple Store...which is 400 miles
away.  He advised that it was burned out and would have to be replaced.

I hate to post on top of my other post, but I called MacConnection's

tech support and he had me up and running in about 15 minutes.  Helped

 me cure some other glitches at the same time.


So much for Apple Support!
