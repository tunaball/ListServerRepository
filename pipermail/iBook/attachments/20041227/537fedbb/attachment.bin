<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param><smaller>I used to use the
Open Firmware Password application and it worked fine on both my iMac
G4 and iBook G4. Then I switched to FileVault. I decided to go back to
Open Firmware Password for security. However, the application does not
work anymore on either machine. I give it a password. Reboot. Then I
use an external firewire hard drive with an OS 10.3 system on it and
both computers boot from the external firewire drive. This should not
happen, I should not be able to boot from an external drive, but I am.


I used to use Open Firmware Password application without any problems
on either machine. Now it does not seem to do anything on either
machine.
