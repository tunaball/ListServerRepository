I figured it out. If you select another disk in Startup Disk, it will
boot up from that disk. It is only when someone inserts a disk or
attaches a drive (without being able to select it in Startup Disk)
that the Open Firmware Password  app will stop the disk from booting.


BTW, for those that do not know, "Open Firmware Password" is an Apple
utility that you can download. I actually do not like it much. Niether
am I crazy about FileVault (it encrypts more than I need).


I  would like something that encrypts/decrypts specific
folders/programs easily. The utilities out there seem to encrypt
files. For example iPhoto Library, I would like to secure it. I think
all major apps should have encryption capabilities for those that want
to use it.


I know about Disk Utilities abilities, but I find its interface and
procedure for encrypting/decrypting to be too cumbersome for regular
frequent use.

back to Open Firmware Password for security. However, the application
does not work anymore on either machine. I give it a password. Reboot.
Then I use an external firewire hard drive with an OS 10.3 system on
it and both computers boot from the external firewire drive. This
should not happen, I should not be able to boot from an external
drive, but I am.


I used to use Open Firmware Password application without any problems
on either machine. Now it does not seem to do anything on either
machine.
