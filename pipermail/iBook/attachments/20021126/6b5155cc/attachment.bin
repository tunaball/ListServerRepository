I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that the new OS is much better
served by having a faster machine. I thought my 500mhz was zippy
enough for 9.1, but now I detest seeing that d*amn beachball so much
and Jaguar's lack of responsiveness, I'm going back to 9.1. . .


IMHO, bite the bullet and get the fastest one you can. . .</BIGGER>
