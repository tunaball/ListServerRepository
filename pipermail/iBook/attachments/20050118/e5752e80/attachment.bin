My 3 yr old iBook has been locking up on occasion. A mute stroke on
iTunes has caused it, sometimes a download from the web or a shift to
a website. The screen freezes and I have to press and hold boot button
to shut down. Usually OK on reboot. Since my Apple Care dies this
month I am curious......
