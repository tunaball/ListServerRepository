I use a Kensington Security cable.  I dont think it will stop someone who really
wants to steal it, since I think the plastic on the iBook would give way with a
strong tug ( I havent tried it!)  But its better than nothing and at least would
have to make the thief work for it.


My 2 cents....

Can anyone suggest an anti-theft cable for the iBook? (Even though I feel it is
just

as safe under one of my three sofas).
