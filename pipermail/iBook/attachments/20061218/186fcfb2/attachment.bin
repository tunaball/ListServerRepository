I'm doing a Google search and I know $150 is the going price, but I'm
wondering what I can substitute for it...eBay is crawling with bad
dealers now.  And, I need it fast!  :)  I can hear those bells
jingling!


Thanks for your help.  There must be other webcams that will work...

find a new one for less than about $150 that seem to be the going rate
after a quick search of internet retailers. There are 6-7 places that
pop up on a google search.


Good luck
