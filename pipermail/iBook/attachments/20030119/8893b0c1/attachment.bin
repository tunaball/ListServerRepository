I'm just coming into this discussion late, but I use the codecs from
www.divx.com, and divx movies play just fine through quicktime with these codecs
for me (tho they are choppy when run from a cd, probaby an unrelated issue). 
They also include a program which fixes divx audio so it can play through
quicktime.


My .02 cents....
