I'm having no problem with internet connect on my desktop running 10.1.


But I just put jaguar on my iBook and, although I belive the settings are the
same, I keep getting disconnected at various (short) intervals with the message:
"Connection terminated because the other side is not responding. Please try
again."  Ideas? (It's even happening in the middle of downloading my mail.)
