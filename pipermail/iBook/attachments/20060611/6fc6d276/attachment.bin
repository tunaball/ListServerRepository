For that, I would first, have to find out how to remove keyboard
(unplug it) from the rest oh the machine...

I did found the top of keyboard little white knobs, that I push
downward, and indeed keyboard separate from rest of the machine...

But how do I disconect it from the machine?

But good news...that key has recently released, because I am now able

But the keyboard is kind of terminatwed...sticky inside, etc

If I could just find a replacement for that not so hard to remove
keyboard, I would gladly attempt the operation!!

Maybe you could soak it overnight in *distilled* water, followed by a
day or two air drying in a warm (but not directly sun-lit) location.
That might dissolve whatever got spilled in the keyboard.
