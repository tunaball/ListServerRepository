Well, if my iBook is any indication of problems that other iBooks have seen
before in high frequency (like screen problems, batteries dying, etc), then you
600 iBook owners should keep an eye on your hard drives, as mine decided today
to die.  I was just using it for some light web surfing when all of a sudden the
hard drive sounded like it didn't want to stop, or couldn't park the heads, all
I heard was a clicky click sound.  I'm running through all the repair steps I
can think of, Diskwarrior, running as a target disk, Disk Utility, but I get the
feeling that none of these things are going to help with a physical problem with
the hard drive, and my data is lost.  Thankfully I did a backup a little while
ago, but I still lost data since my last backup.  So a word to the wise, back up
regularly.  And fellow 600 ibook owners, keep an eye on that drive. (FYI, i had
the bigger 30 gig put in at the time I bought it a year and a half ago.)


If anyone has suggestions on how I might be able to recover data from the drive,
please let me know.  So far Diskwarrior hasn't recognized the drive, target
driving hasn't worked, and I cant get into single user mode.  Trying Disk
utility now, but I doubt that will work.
