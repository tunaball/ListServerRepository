I'm using a Plantronics headset, the one that folds up. It's stereo,
but light and handy and has good sound.

<fontfamily><param>Arial</param> Locally I can’t find a decent headset
to save my life ((Fort Lauderdale, FL, Circuit City, Best Buy, Brands
Mart, CompUSA), so I’m going to order online. I don’t like stereo for
phonecalls, but if it’s recommended I’d consider it. </fontfamily>
