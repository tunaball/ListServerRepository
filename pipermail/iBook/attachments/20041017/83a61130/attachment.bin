If the ibook doesn't see the wireless network, what could be the
culprit?  I'll get a message about an error trying to join the
network.  We open internet connect and won't be able to choose the
"default" network... however, if you keep trying enough times, it will
join up.

This is a new problem - about a week ago it started.  Every component
is new - air port card, router, ibook.

Where do you look first?

My 933mhz G4 iBook with airport card seems to have developed a problem
with acquiring wireless router connection.

Seems to happen when I wake it up from sleep.

I'll open up Systems Preferences - Network, and re-configure for
airport connection.

Sometime this works and then sometimes it takes 2 or 3 attempts before
it reacquires.

I'm connected now and I've locked network settings, thinking this may
help.


Any thoughts?
