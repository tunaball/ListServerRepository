Does anybody know if there is a difference between a
<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>MATSHITA CD-RW CW-8123 and
MATSHITA CD-RW CW-8123C?


I need to replace the optical drive in my 14" G4 iBook.  


System profiler calls it a 8123.  So far I have only been able to find
8123c units.  The 8123c units appear to be black.  I couldn't care
less about the color.  But I am not sure if the color is the only
difference between the 8123 and an 8123C.


I guess I am assuming that this Panasonic is the only optical drive
[cd/cdr/dvd] that would work in my iBook.  Am I wrong?  Are all
slimline slotloading cd/cdr/dvd units pretty much the same and/or
interchangeable?


Thanks
