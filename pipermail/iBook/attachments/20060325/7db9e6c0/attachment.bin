<x-tad-bigger>I just inherited a dead G4 1.2Gig iBook from my grand
daughter. It appears as if she spilled something on the keyboard and
apple says its user abuse or something like that. Any way, it would
cost as much to repair it as it would to buy a new one. My grand
daughter opted for a new one. Here I sit with a beautiful, hardly used
Sleeping Beauty of a G4 iBook, complete with all the documentation,
disks, packaging, everything including   one dead princes. Any ideas
about how I can revive her without costing a kings ransom?
