I have an old HP Laserjet 4mp which works off of an Appletalk serial
port connection so i was screwed when i got my 933 g4 ibook. Because
the printer has always been a rock solid workhorse i got a hold of an
"Asante Micro Asanteprint" eathernet to serial adapter. While it is
recalcitrant once in a while it was indispensible in enabling me to
keep using my existing printer.


You will probably have to try and find one used as i don't think they
are being made any more. Check used Mac shops maybe you can grab one
on the cheap.


good luck

It is a G3, 366, which I just upgraded with an airport card and maxed
out the ram. I have an older (from before an ill-advised foray into
PC-dom) Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS that worked beautifully with my old
PowerMac...but I would love to be able to use it with the IBook.
Anyone have any info on the connectors/cables I could get to do this?</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>
