Hello all, 


I would like to use my firewire hard drive to store files from both my iBook at
home and my PC at work.  Are there any advantages or disadvantages to formatting
with HFS+ as opposed to FAT32 or NTFS?  I've heard that OSX will read PC
formats, while Win XP needs extra software (like MacDrive 5) to read mac
formatted disks.  I would rather not pay for software at this time, so I am
leaning towards formatting it with a PC format, but I'd first like to know if
there are any problems that might occur on the Mac side if I do that.


Thanks in advance!
