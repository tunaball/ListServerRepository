Thanks for the info Richard,

I'd be interested to know how hard you push your ibook. I'll be
recording music (which is why I'm going for the Seagate Momentus as
they are quiet) and I have to be careful the fan doesn't kick in
during sessions.

There's also the matter of cost, - the 7200 is twice the price of the
5400 in the UK!

Cheers,


Steve

I'd like to get the 7200 as I use the ibook for music applications,
