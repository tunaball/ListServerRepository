either put the computer in a soundproof box (they used to 

make them for the old daisy-wheel printers, plenty of room for an
iBook 

in one of those) or run the audio cables to a different room? Either 

way, you don't have to worry about drive or fan noise.


What are you using for audio input?


Just curious....

Well, the joy of owning an ibook is that you shouldn't need bother
with workarounds such as those you suggest, depending on if you can
keep your mac cool, and if you've a quiet hard-drive.

That in itself is something to really value, as the moment can be gone
if you fart around for 10 minutes!


I use a Metric Halo ULN-2 firewire interface, - 2 channels of up to
70db pre-amp gain and exceptional AD/DA converters for the money.
