There is a well reported problem with 10.3.6 and external firewire
drives.

My Fantom drive refused to mount.

I called their tech support and they sent me a firmware updater.

Incidentally, all the Apple support staff knew nothing about the
problem and were no help whatsoever.


I suggest  you look at Maxtor's support page and see if they have a
firmware updater or some other answer.

use a Maxtor 300G Firewire Drive now and then. Pretty much every time
I plug it in I get a kernel panic and need to restart. It did not do
this back with 10.3.5. Someone aware of the issues here?
