Check to see what your IP address is. I was having a similar issue
with my iBook and a Netgear WGR614.

Make sure it is within the range your router is assigning. You can
also access the router and check for attached devices to see if the
iBook MAC address is there.


It turns out I was getting a self assigned IP address, the easiest fix
seemed to be to go to Airport connection and select other type in the
ssid and password to reconnect.


I am assuming there is a WEP security issue with the Netgear and
Airport cards, if I turn off security on my router it works okay.


This is an intermittent problem for me 95% of the time no problems



Good luck

<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> I’ve checked my network settings
and can’t find anything that would cause a problem. I recently had
problems with my iBook not completely loading the ‘finder’ and
operating very slowly. Reloaded panther (archive mode) and that helped
everything but this darn internet access problem.</fontfamily>
