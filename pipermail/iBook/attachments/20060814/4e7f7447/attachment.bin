<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><x-tad-bigger>I am a Mac girl through
and through and have only ever owned older iMacs but have been given
an old clamshell iBook (300MHz/3.2GB/32RAM).  I want to upgrade it and
put in a larger Hard Drive in it as I want to use it to store and play
my 30GB of MP3’s through my stereo.  I would like ANY information on
how I replace the hard drive, where I can buy a cheap replacement
drive, and other advice on this process? Would I need to upgrade the
RAM from the tiny 64MB it presently has if I only intend to use it to
run iTunes? I would appreciate ANY information or links to valuable
websites on the original iBook.  Thanks for your time!  I hope I can
learn a lot from you all.  I am a member of an iMac email list and I
enjoy offering my advice on that so hope I can get some information
from you.  THANKS Carolyn in NZ</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>

to take apart your clamshell at ifixit.com/Guide. Ram and HDD can be
found several places, (eBay comes to mind). Good luck with your
project.</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>
