I've had the MacAlly adaptor for a long time and it has held up better
than my Apple adaptor.  However, it doesn't have the ring that glows
orange/green to show charging activity.  Also, the cord is shorter.  


On the positive side, it is nice and small, lightweight, and better
for portability when traveling light.

<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><smaller>My iBook's ac adapter tip
snapped off (it was a yoyo).  I need to replace it, but before I give
$80 to Apple for a new one, I'd rather buy a MacAlly PowerBook/iBook
AC Adapter
(<color><param>0000,0000,EEEE</param>http://macally.com/spec/specialties/accessories/psac4.html</color>) for
~$30 shipped.  Does anyone have any experience with this ac adapter? 
Is it better than the yoyo?  (Well, just about any ac adapter is
better than the yoyo, since this was my 3rd one).</smaller></fontfamily>
