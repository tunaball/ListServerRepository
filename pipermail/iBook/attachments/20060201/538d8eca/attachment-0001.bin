In Mail, I just started getting this message on one of my four
accounts. Never happened before. (The address is from a spammer.)


<italic>The message from "helena" <<helena_lambert23@yahoo.fr>
concerning “From Helena Lambert.i need your help” has not been
downloaded from the server. You need to take this account online in
order to download it.


On a related issue: When looking at the Mail Preferences I see that 3
of the 4 accounts use Port 110 and 1 uses 25. But the one that's
acting up is among the 3 on 110.


Thanks in advance.
