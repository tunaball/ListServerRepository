buying & receiving my clamshell, I was so eager to use & set it up to
receive and send email, that I plumb forgot to change the other
person's ( short name ), so what it looks like now is: My name _ _ _ _
& so on / the faded out ( short name ) of the other person / my
password + my verified password & the password

hint, as I was reading in the book, ''the missing manual'', it
describes ''editing accounts''-for instance, only administrators can
change an accounts name, & even they Can't change an accounts short
name after the account has been created.

However, I want to re-install Panther, it came with Panther, but also
has O.S.9  which I doubt I'll be using again, if I do this reinstall ,
would these settings stay the same or could I put them in manually and
change that  'D a r n'  short name ?, Just remembered that this name
is also SET for being  the computers name too, as I write this on my
other computer, because when I had written it on that one and sent it, 
it couldn't be sent  (of which I don't know why)  the software update
is installing 7 items Now into the Clamshell. I need some guidance
here. Please ~ !  Thanks.</bigger></color></fontfamily></italic></bold>
