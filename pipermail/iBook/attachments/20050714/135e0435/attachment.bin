If you have no DVD in iBook, then I think you can get some CD
installers from Apple  for Tiger (It will cost you something.

<excerpt>Hi:


I'm trying to install OS 10.4 onto my iBook 700 Mhz CD-ROM with my
external CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive but i cannot get the iBook to reboot to
continue the install. How do I get the iBook to boot from the external
CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive?


Any assistance would be greatly appreciated

Hi:


Yes, it's a USB drive.  If I can get it on a iBook and link them
together with my FireWire cable, can I do it.  I'll just have to make
sure that the Mac with the Combo drive is set up as the target drive. 
Anyone, please let me know if I am correct.  As a side note, could I
have used an external FireWire DVD-ROM?


Thanks,

DMJH
