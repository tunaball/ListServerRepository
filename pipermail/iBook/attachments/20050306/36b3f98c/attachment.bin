Though a rev B iBook with 128MB works just fine on 10.3.8 (much better
than when on 9.2.2), I got carried away repairing my girlfriend's
broken CD drive.


For $261 incl. CA tax and shipping, I added the following from
eWiz.com:


<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param><smaller>Toshiba 40GB (MK4025GAS)
9.5mm 4200rpm Notebook Hard Drive (similar model to iBook's original
6GB.  ATA-6 works fine with ATA-4)

Kingston PC133 512MB 144pin 64x64 SODIMM SDRAM 1.25" (iBook is PC66,
but PC133 works.  The 1.25" is important.)

LG GCC-4243N Slim 24x24x8x CD-RW/DVD-ROM (enabled the RW functionality
with PatchBurn 3.0b9)</smaller></fontfamily>


using the tear-apart instructions at 
http://www.sterpin.net/uk/clamshelluk.htm.  (the CD-RW is not an exact
fit.  You've got to throw away the iBook's tray door and grind away
some of the LG's tray door.)  It is quite an operation to get to hard
drive, but you just need patience.  Get to 10.3.8 by starting with
10.3, not 10.3.5.  You can read DVD data, but you can't play movies


Is there any unholiness that would allow me to add USB 2.0 or FireWire
to this machine for iPod purposes?


Thanks.
