<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>Yes, I read about the hinges
pinching the inverter cables and breaking them. The inverter is much
easier to change than the backlight. My experience was in changing an
entire screen for a Wallstreet. 

The seller has since disappeared. He was advertising the iBook as
having a darkened display. 

Thanks

The backlight is part of the LCD panel, you would have to change the
entire panel. More likely is that the inverter board--kind of like the
starter for a fluorescent light--has broken, and that should be
replaced.


I don't understand what you mean by the second sentence.
