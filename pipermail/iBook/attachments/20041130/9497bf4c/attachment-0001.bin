I have this monitor as well - it IS very nice and I paid close to $500
for it several months ago.  I am contemplating doing the same hack to
run it alongside my new 20" imac G5.  How's that for a desktop  39" !!!

<excerpt>If you hurry and purchase in the next day or two you can get
a Princeton 19" LCD screen for $349. It is $449 upfront with a $100
mail in rebate.

Get it at Newegg.com as they are in stock. Macmall also carried them
but were always out of stock. I bought two of them and I have the hack
for my roommate's 20" iMac so that it will run an external monitor as
an extended desktop. Works beautifully with another screen.

The Princeton has a nice picture and great reviews. Plus, it comes
with both the DVI and VGA connectors. That's the cheapest you will
find a 19" flat panel LCD.

But you have to act quick because it ends today or very soon.

<excerpt>I have a G4 iBook, and I've got the hack that allows me to
use my 'Book

with an external monitor. The new Apple monitors are, for me,

expensive. Will my iBook work with other - and hopefully less expensive

- monitors from other vendors? Any recommendations? I'm looking for

something approximately 20 inches to help me look at my nicer digital

photos, some of which, btw, are at http://www.pbase.com/davewyman

Thanks,

Dave
