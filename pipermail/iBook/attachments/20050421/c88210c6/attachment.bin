Hello;


Anybody on the list a Palm user? I recently got a T5, and have
encountered a bit of trouble with iSync. At least I think it's iSync.
It could be something I'm doing. There's two things that are going on:


A)  Seems any calendar items I enter into the Palm causes anything I
set up in iCal to get all out of whack.


This all started when I wanted to get the Palm to mirror the look of
iCal by having colored bars indicating large projects that took
several weeks to complete. In iCal when you create an event that lasts
"all day" for several days, a bar will appear stretching from the
beginning of that time until the end.  After a while, I noticed I
couldn't make it happen, so I gave up. Then, after creating an event
on the Palm,  I noticed that I could create such a thing from the Palm
side, which is represented by little tiny dots extending from
beginning to end of the event dates.


So, I replicated the events I had originally created in iCal in the
Palm in the new method I discovered.  However, when I went back to
iCal, all of my events on the iCal side were duplicated and out of
sync and generally weird.  The new Palm replicants are now listed
daily rather than in a line.  How can I resolve this?  Is this a known
problem?   Any clues for the clueless?



B)  What about this error below?  I also get the same kind of iSync
error message every time I sync:
