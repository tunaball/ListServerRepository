<PRE>Ibook Listas
G'day! to All, this is my first send to list, as I've just
received my very first iBook as a hand me down, and
I know nothing about it. I'm an ol' legacy Mac user
and do know my way around inside most any BeigeG3
and older DT/MT PCC OS7.53 - OS9.2.2 config'd units, 
and am comfortable around my 3400, 1400, 230Duo,
and 170PBs.
Problematic Blueberry Clamshell iBook:
The problem is(and why my best bud, just got his new
G4 iBook 14&quot; as a replacement); he was having a hard 
time charging the Batt., so he purchased a new one,
installed and charged it, began working again, but the
Screen went very dark, so he rebooted it with the 3 
finger salute only to have it boot up to a black screen
with nothing visible, then for him to believe that this
malady is the BSOD.
I've attempted to zap the PRAM, reseat the RAM, and
did remove the new Batt. and am trying to get it to
boot using only the Power Adapter, and can boot from
System install CD's(various OSs) , but there is only
a quick flicker of the backlight(I think) at the very
beginning of any boot try, but after that all is dark
on the screen, therefore cannot attempt an OF reset.
I can hear RAM check Gong and either the HD or CD
drive. 
Is this screen problem a user fixable?
Also, I would very much like to know if there is a
simple way to connect the iBook to my TV or even
a 17&quot; monitor to mirror the iBook's DT?
This problem maybe is an ol' rehash, so do Please
bear with this iBook noob, and if anyone knows if'n 
this iBook can be saved and made usable again as
my SHS aged son is in need of it's use for his
school studies, I'd be much appreciative of your
kindness, help, advise and time. Do Please advise.

I'm on Digest feed, so do Please CC any replies
to me. TIA

Respectful of GURUs
