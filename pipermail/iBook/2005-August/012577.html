<PRE>Seems I'm full of computer problems this weekend.

My father has called, from the road, and is having problems  
connecting to wireless networks at hotels.  He is running 10.2 on a  
G4 iBook with an airport card.  They regularly use the airport card  
at home, so I doubt that is the problem.

He is able to select the network in the airport menu, and it shows a  
strong signal, but Safari is unable to resolve any URLs.  I did have  
him change his location to &quot;automatic&quot; in his network preferences (it  
had been set to Comcast), but it did not help.

I'm stuck here, and he's frustrated.  I know that Comcast configured  
the iBook for their network, and I'm wondering if they would have set  
it up in a way that somehow makes this difficult.

I would greatly appreciate any pointers.  They've had alot of  
problems with this Ibook lately, and are threatening to go back to  
Dell (ugh...)  They have had to send it in twice in the past month  
for logic board replacements, and the second time Apple forgot to put  
the batter back in, and then took two weeks to ship the battery.  I  
would love to help them get online on the road with this, I want them  
to have a good experience.

Thanks!

Samantha
