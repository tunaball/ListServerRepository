<PRE>The Combo drives I have seen in early White iBooks is a Toshiba SD- 
R2212. Some people have been able to install the Toshiba SD-R2512 and  
another Toshiba that I don't recall the model. These can be had on  
ebay for as little as $50. When you can find them. They are often  
pulls from HP or Toshiba laptops and the bezels have to be hacked to  
fit an iBook. If you are replacing another 2212 the old bezel may work?

The dual USB iBooks are old enough now that many are dying and the  
drives are on the market; But most only had CD-Rs.

I have a couple of the Dual USBs to install Combos on in the next  
couple of weeks and can give you more infor on the bezels and such.

The flashing thing seems as much myth as anything that I can tell so  
far. I have personally not read a real account of this.
