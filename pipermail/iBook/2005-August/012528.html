<PRE>iBook Listas
G'day!, not to ring my own bell here, but there hasn't been
any too much in the way of positive on this problem...,
with a slight tweak on the thread..

</I>While, I've been able to set up a try at FWDM with a friend's
G4 iBook sometime next week, and will be venturing out to
downtown in search of an AV cable(many Thanx for the look
see link) later this week, in the meantime; I've been Googling
in hopes of some insight on the Open Firmware commands
and am coming up dry on things to try, would anyone have 
a usable list of them to share?? Also, are there any favorite
and suggestable user Forums for me to start my hunting in??
I've also come across yet another color scheme being used 
for this still unknown processor speed, single-USB/single-
Firewire/with AV-out port'd equipped Model and that is 
nick'd as: &quot;Indigo&quot;, so am still mix'd up on which is which.

I also, came across an image of the Reset button, which does
appear to be a lil' above flushline and quite different than the
one that this iBook has which is slightly below flush with no
raised symbol but flat, but I don't believe that the switch is 
stuck down thus causing the black screen problem, as it just
simply does as Guru Malcolm has said it would.

Any other ideas to try, advise, help, suggestions will be super
welcomed and very much appreciated. TIA
