<PRE>A while back I wrote a question about my video screen going green and 
needing a tap come back to normal. I didn't want to believe it, but 
sure enough after a while the logic board went out completely. I 
followed the link to Apple provided here and found the problem is 
common in old G3's, and Apple was prolonging coverage for them.

First question: how common is this for my early 2004 14&quot; G4 1 GHz 
iBook (640 mb, 60 gig hd)?

Fortunately, since I knew it was coming, I had backed up knowing that 
the computer would have to go in under AppleCare. While that would be 
a day or so turnaround in US, it took 8 days here. Fortunately they 
didn't erase it, but...

The Apple Store installed Tiger. That was nice, but then, I didn't 
pay for it, I was still using Panther.

So, I feel bad, but I don't want to go through the work of 
uninstalling it and redoing Panther. I think I may buy a new one in a 
couple of months with Tiger installed, and then I will wipe it and 
reinstall Panther before I sell it.

But, I have some problems now.

First they said the hard drive was having problems and should be 
replaced, and I have to pay for that (because there is a crack in the 
case right over the hard drive, resulting from an end over end 
multiple flight tumble down a marble stair case fifteen months ago, 
until the logic board, tho, it's worked well ever since). However, 
the hard drive checks okay with SMART status in Disk Utility, and 
checks okay with Tech Tools Pro.

Second question: Does it seem that there is some reason that they 
might think the hard drive needs replacing? Actually they said it is 
slow, but only recommended replacing it with another 4200 60 gig.

But with Tiger, now it seems to be actively swapping in and out, even 
when I am not using anything that seems to require it. The whole 
computer seems to be running hotter, especially the hard drive, the 
fan is on much more often and the battery life is cut in half.

Third question: Why is it happening and what can I do about it?

Hope this wasn't too long. Thanks in advance for any help.

Eric Richardson
