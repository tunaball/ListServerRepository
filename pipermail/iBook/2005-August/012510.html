Shutdown, I pulled the mains, but could still hear the drive
going, so guessed that she went into Batt. using mode.
Should I simply press down on the paper clip(just now, I tried
and felt a springy resistance) , or do I need to also push and
hold the Power button down at the same time?

</I>Wish I had one, but the friend who gave me this iBook has his
new one, so will try to hook up with him on his next trip down 
from the mountains to try it out, might take awhile tho. Does
this seem to be a problem with the screen, or just the backlight?
And with it in FWDM will TechTool Pro version 2, 3 or 4 be 
able to run it's video circuitry tests on the problem'd iBook.

Meanwhile, are there any other lil'  things that I can try?
Any/All ideas, advice, help, suggestions, will be much
appreciated and very welcomed. TIA
