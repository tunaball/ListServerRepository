Eric, day before yesterday, Creativepro.com sent out their newsletter
containing an article about a scripting your photo folders.  There is
a link in the article to get the free applescript.  The article is at:
"http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22342.html?cprose=6-01".


This is the neatest script... you know how your digital camera folders
contain file names that the dig. camera company wants them to have,
well this script names all of the photos in the folder, the name of
the folder + the date of the picture!  It's a drag-n-drop whizzzzzz.


Check it out!


Good luck... I know this is not exactly what you were asking about,
but this might be something you want to look into.


HAVE A GREAT YEAR!!!

<excerpt>I am wanting to make smart folders using the dates the
pictures were taken. Several months ago I successfully did this by
setting the title to the date. This worked fine since the date format
was day, month year. Now the only date format I can get is month, day
year. So making a smart folder with the criteria of title contains
July 2004 does not work since the title is something like July 4,
2004. This worked previously, what am I doing wrong now? I am running
OSX10.2.8 and iPhoto 4.0.3


Thanks,

Eric
