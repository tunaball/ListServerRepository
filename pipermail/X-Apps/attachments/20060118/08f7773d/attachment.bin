a very amateur query!  My son sent me three video attachments which I
cannot open,

I suddenly noticed that they are AVI - but am not sure what this
means, or how I can open them.

Normally I can open video with imovie or one of the usual programmes.

As they are of my new grandson in Thailand - I am a bit fed up.

There is a lot on AVI on the internet - but not sure what to do!!

Advice please.....   Rosemary
