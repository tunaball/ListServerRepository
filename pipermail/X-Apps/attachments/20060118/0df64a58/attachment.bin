Thank you- what fun to get the help I need from Brazil!


(We are oap's and my husband thinks it is 'magic'!!)

Downloaded VLC video player - and it worked...

Saw and heard my grandson - great - but then it stopped and said my
computer

is too slow.!  So it proved I need the new mac for my birthday.

Any views anyone on new macs. thought of the new combination imac but

still not sure.  I am on old g4 with 108 hard disc, but only 400 Mhz

System 10.3.9

<excerpt>My son sent me three video attachments

which I cannot open,

I suddenly noticed that they are AVI - but am not sure what this means,

or how I can open them.

</excerpt>Rosemary,


try VLC Media Player:

http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html

or MPlayer:

http://mplayerosx.sourceforge.net/

Both programs play AVI files and a myriad video formats.
