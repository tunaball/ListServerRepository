I'll reply to all at once. To Kirk, Thanks for the tip! Yes I have 
about fifty friends and relatives I am making a thematic CD for as a 
stocking stuffer.

To John: See below.

&gt;<i> From: &quot;Simon G. Trask&quot; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-apps.html">simon at simbiosis.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> The seven copies limitation you refer to is for the playlist 
</I>&gt;<i> arrangement
</I>&gt;<i> of files, not the audio files themselves.
</I>
&gt;<i> You mention that you're an artist yourself. Where do you draw the
</I>&gt;<i> line on copying of your work?
</I>
I have people downloading my art from my webfolio all the time. Whether 
I like it or not. MacWorld copied my work and distributed prints to 
parties unknown when I placed in the 03 illustration contest. My Rep 
passes out samples. I send out samples. It's all part of the process of 
being a commercial artist. Sometimes you have to give to get.

I have no intention whatsoever of selling the music files in question, 
including them in any commercial enterprise, digitally sampling them 
nor passing them off as my own work in whole or part. All tracks are 
listed and credited. It is my intention that my friends and family will 
enjoy work of bands they may not have heard of, such as Cornershop's , 
&quot;Wogs Will Walk&quot; , enjoy it as I do and buy the album. I am fairly 
sure, given my friends, that will happen.

As an artist, if you were to use MY art in a similar fashion I would be 
proud not pissed. On specific jobs with clients I sell my rights up 
front. What happens after that is beyond my ability to defend in court 
so why tweak over it?

As to Johns' flame, I am an artist and part of art IS stealing. Call it 
being &quot;influenced by&quot; or &quot;sampling&quot; it's still a kind of theft. Artist 
who think they are original are usually self delusional. As far as copy 
rights infringement, from experience, it's all about intention. The law 
generally keys off the fact or perception of consumer fraud or loss of 
income.

As artists we need to distinguish between what protects US and what 
protects the parasites who feed OFF of us.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, are you aware of the Creative Commons movement
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.creativecommons.org/">http://www.creativecommons.org/</A>),
</I>
Yes! Thanks!

&gt;<i> From: Stephen Hoy &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x-apps.html">hoyboy59 at yahoo.com.au</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> The iTunes Music Store
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have my stuff on its 'books'so perhaps that
</I>&gt;<i> means I can still 'steal' from myself.
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts?
</I>
No. But it is possible to run afoul of a cookie-cutter 
security-marketing ploy. I'd think you would be using more 
sophisticated gear to compile your work?
