<PRE>Hi John.

Someone helped me with the very same issue awhile back. I will copy the 
messages below (Sorry for the wierd order).

Good luck,
-Said

--------------------


Upon your lead about DVDExtractor I discovered two more sources of info:
<A HREF="http://mornmist.2y.net/~blibbler/tutorial/basic/">http://mornmist.2y.net/~blibbler/tutorial/basic/</A>
and
<A HREF="http://visionlab.harvard.edu/resources/DV/ripping.htm">http://visionlab.harvard.edu/resources/DV/ripping.htm</A>

Everything went fine except that I now have two 1.3 gb files of audio. 
The stereo channels extracted separately into two files of different 
size: 430mb and 184mb! Using mAC3dec I converted these two AC3 files to 
AIFF though, strangely, they both converted to 1.3 gb. I now have two 
stereo AIFF files with the same data on each channel. I've tried 
combining the selections from each file that I want within SonicWorx but 
the synching is quite difficult. I haven't yet found a way to delete one 
channel and replace just that channel with its counterpart from the other 
file. 

Is it normal that the .VOB extracted audio files are split stereo 
channels? Do you have any suggestions for obtaining a single stereo file?

Best Wishes,
-Said

</I>This is probably because AC3 files are compressed using an adaptive 
coding algorithm (very similar to variable bit rate MP3's) - often, 
there's much less audio information in the rear channels, so the files 
end up being smaller.  But when you decompress them to AIFF's, they end 
up the same size because AIFF's encoding is completely linear.

</I>If you can be bothered sitting through a 12 meg download, get Pro Tools 
Free from <A HREF="http://www.digidesign.com">http://www.digidesign.com</A>
It lets you edit and shift around up to eight tracks of audio at a time, 
and it treats stereo files as two mono files, so if you import a stereo 
file, the program will split it into two mono files - then you pan one 
all the way left and all the way right.  The big advantage of this, of 
course, is that you can edit the two (or up to eight) channels 
completely independently of each other.  Then when you're done, you can 
'bounce' it all down to a normal stereo track, ready for CD burning.

You can download the manual for PT Free from the Digidesign website, 
it's a fairly full-on read.  If you need to know anything and can't be 
bothered filching through a 500 page PDF file for it, just drop me a 
line...I've been using the full 64 track version for about five years 
now, you get to know these things work....=]

&gt;<i>Is it normal that the .VOB extracted audio files are split stereo 
</I>&gt;<i>channels? Do you have any suggestions for obtaining a single stereo file?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The only time I've ever had to do this, I've used DVD's that had Linear 
PCM audio tracks, so it was ready to go after a quick
sample rate conversion.  But the above should help.
