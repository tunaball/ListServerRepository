<PRE>I don't really know what (or if) I did to gets things working. 
JunkMatcher seems to have kicked in and is very nicely shuttling those 
bad acting spams over to the junk folder. I can empty that without 
causing any crashes.   Since it's now working I haven't had any spams 
at all get thru to my in-box. And no crashes!  If this keeps up for a 
few more days I think I'll actually make a contribution to those guys!  
It's donation-ware. If you're interested in trying it out here's the 
URL:

<A HREF="http://junkmatcher.sourceforge.net/Home/index.html">http://junkmatcher.sourceforge.net/Home/index.html</A>

It installs pretty automatically and you don't really have to do 
anything to get it going. If you want to create some filters your self, 
you'll have to wade thru the notation they use. And BTW it works in 
addition to the filters you already have in Mail.app

Happy again,
John
