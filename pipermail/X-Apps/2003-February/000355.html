   One poster, and I apologize to that person for losing the orig. post, 
suggested that it might be  timing out and that I should use entourage. 
I have it but prefer mail.app to it. I have gotten my mail that way but 
really want to fix mail.app. I have looked to see if the server was 
actually timing out and believe it is waiting on mail.app to finish. I 
let it sit all day with only mail.app running and set to check mail at 
5 min. intervals, it finally did retrieve all 2609 emails plus 46 more 
that came in before it had finished. It took 4 hrs. to do it. Once I 
had gone thru them again, since they went back a month or so, I deleted 
them and  selected get mail again (manually this time). The same 2609 
appeared again and mail attempted to retrieve them again. A dialog pops 
up saying mail could not be downloaded and that I should check network 
settings and etc. I did that again for the umpteenth time and all names 
PW's, and etc. were still correct. Getting mail is sporadic and comes 
in bits of what the activity bar says it is getting. Like :  3 out of 
34, 31 out of 148, and etc., but stopping before it completes the 
total. When it does get mail, most of it will be ones it has already 
gotten previously. I do not want to go back to 10.2.3 because I like 
the other new items that 10.2.4 brings. Does anyone have a clue  as 
what could be the matter ?
   Safari also pops up with a dialog that server can't be found a lot 
and at first few attempts wouldn't let me get hotmail either. It 
wouldn't accept my password to get in. Safari is extremely slow, when 
in 10.2.3 it was really fast.  IE was able to go right in and works 
fine with no problems. As does iphoto, itunes, and imovie.
