I'm in the market for a new scanner and I wonder if any of you have
suggestions on models. I have an iMac 500MHz G3 512 MB. I seem to have
'misplaced' the website I used to go to compare products. Anyone have
that addy?

It really depends on what you want to scan. I have 2 scanners on my BGE 400
G3. Both are Canons , a 656U &amp; a D660U. I use the 56 for OCR and Text based
scanning and the 60 for slides, negatives, Film and Photo scanning. I am
happy with both. Actually the 56 can do photos and graphics quite well too,
but not slides. The 60 is Back-lit for this purpose . Look for a scanner
that can produce the resolution that fits your needs. There are many choices
available in many price ranges. Also be sure to fit the system requirements
to your machine. I use Jag 2.3 and have 768 MB RAM. Neither of these are the
fastest model , nor are they the highest resolution, but the prices were
reasonable and I am not in a high speed demanding office. I am using them to
reproduce old family documents and , film slides into a family tree style
book complete with photos of the individuals in the tree, their
documentaries and historical notes. once those are completed , I merge them
into FamilyTreeMaker in VPC 6.0.1 running 2kpro. where all the notes, photos
and documentaries are merged to the individuals records. Sorry for the long
post , but it is critical to the pocket book for you to first examine your
needs in order to fit them to an accessory. You didn't mention what yours
were or how you intend to use the proposed scanner. I hope this helps in
some way.
