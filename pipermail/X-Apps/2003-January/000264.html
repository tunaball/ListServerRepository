I wish to give a different viewpoint on VueScan and Hamrick Software.  
In December I purchased it to use with a Microtek ScanMaker 6800 
scanner.  The demo looked good, but it was hard to view the image due 
to the watermark &quot;demo&quot; all over the image.  With all of the praise, 
the fact that it stated that it supported my scanner and the experience 
I had with the demo, I purchased it right away for $40 from the website.

The next day I found that it would not do a quality scan properly 
because it did not register the colors correctly.  Ed Hamrick confirmed 
that VueScan does not compensate for the &quot;slight&quot; difference in 
position for the lines of red, green and blue sensors on ANY of the 
Microtek models.

I asked him if he would add support, which he said he could do if 
someone loaned him a scanner.  When no one offered to loan him a 
scanner (he is in England and I am in the US) I asked for my money 
back.  He has responded that there is no way he will return my money 
for the purchase of VueScan even though he admits that his website says 
that it will support my scanner and he admits that the software doesn't 
even attempt to support it properly.

I have disputed this with my credit card company, but the payment is 
via PayPal, and Ed Hamrick has a disclaimer on his website.  However, I 
believe that Ed is &quot;not doing the right thing&quot; and cannot suggest that 
anyone purchase from someone who is unwilling to provide proper 
resolution to a customer problem.  While his software has good 
features, this treatment of a customer is unexceptable to me.
