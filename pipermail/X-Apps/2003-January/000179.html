<PRE>Dear Jerry,

Thank you very much for your advice.

I formatted the harddisc today.
Then I perfomed a clean install of 10.3 and run the updater right after that.
Now I have sytem 10.2.3

I was able to use Mail one time.
It downloaded several mails and I was able to send one.

Then I shut down the computer. After about 3 or 4 hours, I decided to check again.

It now fails again.

Nothing  happens until the computer falls asleep. (after an hour or so)

As you advised, I created another user and logged in as &quot;testperson&quot;.

Now, mail works again.
It shows me a window, it seems to receive messages but it refuses to send one. ( I am almost sure that  
my entries were correct, but I will double check them)

As far as I understand you, this means that my users/username folder is corrupt or something similar.
What do you think, I should do?

Thank you very much.

Hi,

Horrible stuff..

Log in as another user and start mail, to test that it is mail and not your folders

Then log back in as yourself and start it up, leave it running, how long do you wait before you kill it ...It 
is running because you have to manually kill it so let it do its stuff for a while!

Look in /var/log, do a tail of system.log to see if there are any messages relating to your problem.

If you get messages, what are they ?

Sorry I can't help you more but I don't think you have to reinstall, I think there is something in your 
mail folders that is causing the problem, that is why I asked you to log in as another user to test &gt; it..

Good luck with it,

Jerry

Dear List,
unfortunately I have a very serious problem with Apple's Mail Application and I hope that somebody of
you knows a solution:
I just uprgaded from OS 10.1.5 to 10.2
I did a clean install and allowed the installer disc to erase the partition MacOS 10.1.5 was on.
Now, the mail application doesn't work anymore.
It ran the first time I started the computer and I even received one or two messages, but now it just
doesn't work anymore.
The application starts but neither windows nor messages appear.
I furthermore cannot shut down Mail anymore, only by alt-apple-esc.
So far I have tried to reinstall System 10.2 with and without deleting mail and library/mail/... at first.
But it doesn't work.
What can I do?
Do I have to reinstall the systemsoftware again?
Thank you for your advice
