<PRE>

&gt;<i> I'll be grateful for comments and observations from those who have  
</I>&gt;<i> taken
</I>&gt;<i> the plunge.
</I>



   At present, in my Store/office/ Lab, and Home , I have Tiger on a  
collective of 8 machines. They consist of a variety of machines. I  
like all of my machines to be consistent and synchronized with each  
other so that, in my roaming around, they will all appear the same. I  
utilize business class Roadrunner, and at home residential  
Roadrunner, isync and .mac to accomplish that portion.
   I began with my lowest configuration, an imac 333 tray load,  
first. It is used by my hostess/ secretary, at the door, to log in  
customers and their broken equipment using quickbooks pro 5. It has  
preformed well since the beginning OSX and is now at X.4.3 . Next  
came the BW 400 and the rest followed shortly there after ( Imac 500  
and 600 DV's , AGP 400, QS 867, and both MDD Firewire 800's). All of  
the machines have their own list of jobs to perform and are relied on  
heavily to do so. I use a variety of hubs, switches, and routers to  
maintain connectivity with each other , three printers, the internet,  
and my iDisk. I have absolutely no complaints so far with Tiger, so  
far that I can blame on it anyway. All of my machines have their own  
character and flavor. Of the few bugs that I have had down thru the  
line of OSX , the next update was there to fix them before I was even  
sure what caused them.

Go ahead, Jump . It is a nice landing .
