<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm looking for a four-port USB hub. All suggestions appreciated. This 
</I>&gt;<i> will go on a G5, connecting an HP printer and possibly a scanner. No 
</I>&gt;<i> particular looks or size requirements, but must be plug 'n' play with 
</I>&gt;<i> Panther and beyond.
</I>
I can't recommend a brand, but I will give you a warning. Buy a name 
brand hub.

I may get flamed for this advice. My reason is &quot;anecdotal&quot; - that is, 
it could be related to the hub(s) I worked with. The scenario unfolded 
along these lines - we had two no-name USB hubs (same models). A 
PowerMac G4 dual 450, and then later that same hub on a PowerMac MDD. 
The hubs in question caused many problems - it was the reason I ended 
up erasing OS 9 and putting 10.1 on one of the computers. I wasn't 
aware at the time what problems the hub could cause.

The problems were as follows (in no particular order): Illustrator 10 
crashes (usually on key presses), computer would not start up, random 
freezes in OS 9, Wacom tablet instability, the Wacom tablet would just 
stop working, the mouse would just stop working - unplugging and 
replugging it fixed this problem, etc... and so on.

Now, there could have been other reasons, but after the hub was 
replaced with a mac branded hub, Illustrator stopped crashing. Routing 
certain devices through the hub (Wacom tablet) was not possible.

That same hub model was used with a PowerBook G3. To be quick about 
this one, it caused weird issues with the bottom USB port on the laptop 
(but not the top one!), where the keyboard would not work. The keyboard 
(with Quark USB dongle) would only work when the hub was plugged into 
the top port. This computer also had a Wacom attached directly to the 
laptop.

So, in both of these experiences, the Hub caused some instability. I am 
hesitant to say it is because a Wacom tablet was attached to the hub, 
and some of the above problems happened when the tablet was not plugged 
in. Both hubs also had some type of Iomega device - one a Zip 100, and 
the other a 250. Both Iomega devices worked properly.
