<PRE>Hi all,
This is one problem which even Apple Support hasn't been able to help 
me with!

Ever since I installed Panther, I cannot access my iDisk anymore 
through the Finder. There's a WebDAV panel that pops up asking me to 
re-confirm my password and then gives me an error saying the username 
or password is wrong.
Being an Apple Support Specialist here in Bombay, India I've tried 
every trick in the book from changing my password, resetting the 
keychain, checking the iDisk Pref. pane etc. No luck.
Then I came across a utility called Goliath that has a feature for 
WebDAV to access your iDIsk. To check weather maybe my ISP (a solely PC 
knowledgeable provider) has a problem or something I tried that utility 
and it not only instantly connected but was very fast. I was pretty 
shocked that if that can work why can't the Finder? Also, it cannot be 
an ISP issue since Jaguar was connecting perfectly fine all this time. 
Another experiment was to use Dial-up access and I noticed that it 
worked fine too. My iDisk mounted on the desktop just fine.  When i 
check the space used on my iDisk from the pref. pane, it shows me that 
just fine.
This has left me completely flummoxed. I wish someone is able to help 
me with this since one of my main uses is iPhoto for my iDisk and that 
does not work except thru dial-up.
So here's the final overview:

iDisk
Does not mount in Finder using WebDAV but does using AFP
Goliath works fine using WebDAV thru Cable &amp; Dial-Up
iDisk works fine thru DIal-Up but not Cable
iDisk worked fine in Jaguar thru same cable.

iPhoto
Does not Publish Homepage thru Cable
Publishes Homepage thru Dial-Up

iDisk Pref. Pane
Shows space on iDisk thru both Cable and ISP. Does not give any 
password error thru either.

Someone please help!
