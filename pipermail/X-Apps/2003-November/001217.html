Just a note to end this string and to thank you for your support

I finally was able to  to successfully Optimize my Primary  Drive  with 
  Drive 10  V1.1.4   using the routine of   booting up on a backup drive 
  ( as you suggested)

My main problem was not the journaling issue but the  fact that the 
Primary Drive would not dismount. I could boot up and  read-write to 
the primary drive , but Using Disk Utility it would not dismount , and 
hence, reformat or erase or whatever!
This was new experience for me. I do not know how long the anomaly 
existed since I never had the need to configure my primary drive  as a 
non bootup volume.

   I will not go into all the  attempted &quot;fix-it&quot; scenarios that did not 
work; but what finally did the trick was to run
&quot;Repair Permissions&quot; in  Disk Utility.
And that was a real experience. When  I toggled it ON, there was a 
continuous   scrolling in the display window that continued on for a 
full 10 minutes or so. It would appear that every file (?) on the disk 
had to be repaired.
I really  don't know what that was all about or what the corruption 
source was; but after the smoke cleared, Disk utility was able to 
dismount the drive and successfully run its verification program. And , 
as delineated above, Drive 10 was able to do its thing

Thanks again for your time
