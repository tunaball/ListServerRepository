I haven't had any luck with junk mail filtering in Mail. When in 
training mode, doesn't Mail ever note any mail as junk when in training 
mode? I have marked messages for over a month as junk, without any help 
from mail. So, I think maybe it's time to put it on automatic from 
training mode. Several days have gone by and Mail still hasn't marked 
any message as junk. Although, now that it's out of training mode, 
anything I mark as junk gets moved out of the current mailbox so I 
don't have to also delete it.

Junk filtering in Mail just doesn't work for me and I'm so sick of junk 
mail. My inbox has been getting deluged with junk mail - I'm getting 
probably 100 per day. That's about how much legit mail I get daily. 
That really stinks that 50% of my mail is useless and irritating spam 
and I just have to accept it. What do people who have kids do with this 
flood of adult crap coming in their mailboxes? That's so embarrassing 
to download email before I leave for work in the morning, then launch 
my email program, and the first thing I have to look at on my commute 
by bus is some sick porn ads. I can find my own &quot;dirty&quot; pictures - with 
my digital camera I can take loads of shots of my puppies out playing 
in the blizzard we've gotten here in Colorado. My dogs are all in 
perma-stink, dirty, wet, dog mode with this weather. I've already got 
more &quot;dirty&quot; than I can handle without the addition of spam.

I think I'll give PowerMail a little more of a try this week. Something 
has got to work without me having to invest so much time trying to 
handle the junk mail myself. I'm creating new filters every day. Does 
anyone know the maximum filters/rules one can have? I have already 
reached the criteria limit within some of the rules because of the spam.
