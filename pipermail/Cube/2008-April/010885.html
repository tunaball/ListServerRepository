<PRE>hi again:
i hate to bother you guys, but i am at a loss here. i got a different  
cube  to test the parts for possible damage, but at the end i decided  
to keep this newer one. i upgraded the ram- no problem there- and  
decided to put a super drive and a new hd. i figured it would be best  
to do them together, although now it might seem like a foolish idea. i  
installed the super drive, made sure the hd is set to slave and  
connected the old hd as an external drive to return it to the sick  
cube. cannot do a target disk mode because the hd has to be set to  
slave.
everything went well, disk warrior recognized the hd as slave and  
booted for the disk, which sounded like a good omen. i connected the  
original cube's hd to a usb universal drive adapter. and it promptly  
went puff- smoke and all and the distinct burning smell. when i  
checked the power connector, #2 looks burnt. i think the drive is a  
goner too. i already contacted owc about this and they will let me know.
now, since the drive is unformatted, the only means to boot is the  
disk warrior disk inside the machine and it won't come out. i opened  
the cube again, took the top plate out and pressed the button to eject  
the disk.
i put everything together and inserted a jaguar disk to format the  
drive and start form there.
the only thing is that now the screen is dead. the power light in both  
the cube and the monitor is on. i double cheked the video riser and  
video cards and they appear to be well seated.
any ideas? suggestions? help?
thanks in advanced.
g
</PRE>
