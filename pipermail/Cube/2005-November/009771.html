I wonder if it might be the graphics card.

Some have had problems with the graphics card apparently going out, but that has been, from what I've seen/read, vertical white/grey bars.  But who knows...

I had a stock G4 450MHz Cube, with BTO ATI Radeon 32MB (had a fan on it), and it started getting vertical grey stripes/bands after a few minutes and the only thing was to turn it off and come back later.

Replaced the graphics card and the problem went away.  Didn't bother to put the old card back in to see if the problem reappeared, but the difference was night and day.

Since the one you have is older, that was my first thought.  My thought was that the heat has caused the graphics card to cook and start wigging out.

You might see if that card in there has a fan and if so, is it turning.
