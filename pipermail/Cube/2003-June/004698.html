</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, 4-Sight works on all Macs except the 2 Cubes running Jaguar.

</I>&gt;<i> latest versions of Java. All the Cubes connect to all other services 
</I>&gt;<i> on the network and can file share, surf and email with no problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Has anybody on the list seen weird networking issues with other 
</I>&gt;<i> programs and successfully fixed them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance.

are you sure the ethernet is working did you try plugging it in 
directly somewhere?
Does this fax server use appletalk or something maybe that needs to be 
turned on?
