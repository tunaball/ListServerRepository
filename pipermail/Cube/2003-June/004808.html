</I>&gt;&gt;<i>To Reid,
</I>
    I am sorry to hear that you lost your Cube.  When the technician at the
Apple dealer here in Nagoya told me about the Sonnet upgrade causing a fire
in a Cube, I was hesitant, too, in believing him.  After all, there have
been many posts from Cube owners in the U. S. A. saying that they had been
successful with their Sonnet upgrades.  I thought maybe the Sonnet man in
Tokyo had just installed the upgrade, wrongly, that his incompetence had
caused the fire.  Yet, we know that there is a difference in the electrical
current between here and in America, and that the Japanese are a scrupulous
people, so when they decided to prohibit the Sonnet upgrade in Cubes
nation-wide for maybe that reason, I decided to wait.  You say that your
Cube ran well with OS 9.2 and that the DC-DC board &quot;popped&quot; as you started
using OS X.  I wonder whether OS X had anything to do with it, or whether
the board would eventually had burned out anyway had you continued running
your Cube with OS 9.  Actually, I am running my Cube with OS 9.2, and I do
not plan to upgrade to OS X.  I use my computer mainly for e-mail, surfing
the internet, word processing, and for playing the occasional game.  It
seems that if one stays with OS 9, then having a more powerful CPU is
unnecessary.  However, I was thinking that perhaps the Sonnet 800 MHz
upgrade would be adequate, and safe, to help speed up the scrolling speed in
word processor programs, to speed up the loading time for certain games, and
specifically to help this GeForce 2 video card that I have installed to
allow me to play &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; with more options.  However, after hearing
of your catastrophe, I am hesitant in installing even an 800 MHz upgrade.
About Other World Computing and Sonnet America not knowing about the Sonnet
policy here in Japan, and of the difference in the electrical current
between that of America and Japan, and failing to warn you, maybe neither
party knows about Japan Sonnet's policy of prohibiting Sonnet upgrades being
installed in Cubes here in Japan.  There is always that language barrier.
Or maybe O. W. C. was just too pleased to make a sale to double check with
Sonnet America, again, or maybe Sonnet America just hasn't bothered to tell
O. W. C. about the Sonnet policy in Japan.  Regardless, I hope that you will
be able to get your Cube repaired, somehow.  If not, and if your heart is
set on sticking with the Cube, I don't know about in Tokyo, but here in
Nagoya in two or three Apple computer shops there are used Cubes for sale
for less than a hundred thousand.  I know, that is still much money.  All
the best to you.  Thank you for the note.
