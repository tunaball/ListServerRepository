<PRE>I believe you will be able to take advantage of the SMP if you have 2 CD-ROM
drives.  iTunes doesn't seem to be written to split up ripping of a single
disk, but it is capable of processing more than one disk at a time.  So in
effect, each CPU would be processing each CD (yes, I know how OSs work and
this is not necessarily technically accurate).

I haven't tested this of course since I have a Cube...   :)

&gt;<i> Your reader is now your bottleneck. Watch OfficeMax ads. Right now you 
</I>&gt;<i> can get a 52x24x52x CD-RW drive there for $9.95 after $40 rebate. 
</I>&gt;<i> Remove your old 24x reader and put the new one in your FW case and try 
</I>&gt;<i> that for ripping. You should get 19X rips at least. I would love to 
</I>&gt;<i> know what your rip speed is after you do this. I hope you do. It's $14 
</I>&gt;<i> including 8% sales tax here in California.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Ripping CD's before the upgrade was a 5x to 7x proposition

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;How is it that PC's rip in the mid 20x's? My wife's Gateway 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;consistently rips at 23x-25x. It blows my mind.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;K-Man, if you ripped 8-10 CD's a day you would finish in less than a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;year. (assuming you were to go cold turkey and not buy any for that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;time). I just purchased the latest album from John Scofield from Apple 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;for 9.99 and it took no time to DL. Not only did I say $$$ but also 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the time to rip it, which equals $$$.
