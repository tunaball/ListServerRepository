Crimsons are nice. I'd love to have one of those &quot;Jurassic Classic&quot; ones...
They're slower than Indies, but the sheer appearance of them is just too
cool.

Suns are abundant, indeed. Especially in this age of IT companies filing for
bankruptcy left, right and centre. :-)

QED.

Wanna hear a &quot;funny&quot; story?

At the desk opposite mine, at work, sits a guy who has been a programmer for
25+ years (COBOL, DB2, that sort of thing). He told me the other day that
back in the early 80's, he bought himself his first &quot;real&quot; PC, an IBM PC
Portable (Model 5155). Description for the uninitiated:

&lt;<A HREF="http://oldcomputers.net/ibm5155.html">http://oldcomputers.net/ibm5155.html</A>&gt;

Anyway, he tells me about he was cleaning out his attic, and came across it.
He'd repackaged it in the original box when it was retired, with all the
manuals and disks in it. So I ask him how much he wants for it. He says he
investigated the possibilities of upgrading it to contemporary standards,
and when he found out that this would be impossible, HE PUT IT OUT IN THE
STREET WITH THE TRASH!!!

Holy sweet mother of Jesus, I thought I was going to faint.

Rest assured, after that little fit I threw over such behaviour, the poor
guy will probably never throw away even a floppy disk without consulting me,
first.
