</I>I didn't think that either Sonnet or Powerlogix allowed its CPUs to be
exported overseas to private persons.  I thought that one had to buy their
products through an Apple dealer, here in Japan.  Of course they are much
more expensive buying them from an Apple dealer, as you probably know.
Thank you for the information.  However, regarding the Sonnet CPU upgrades,
the man at the Apple dealer here in Nagoya informed me one day that Apple
dealers throughout Japan are not permitted by the Sonnet head office in
Tokyo to install or otherwise service the Sonnet CPU upgrade for the Cube.
The Nagoya man told me that the man at the head office of Japan Sonnet had
tried to install the upgrade for the Cube and the Cube caught on fire.  The
man here in Nagoya further informed me that if I were to obtain a Sonnet
upgrade for the Cube and installed it myself that no Apple dealer here in
Japan would be authorized to service my Cube.  After this conversation with
the Apple dealer, I looked at the Powerlogix and Sonnet CPUs that were on
display in his showcase, and sure enough on the outside of the box of the
Sonnet upgrade, the Cube icon which otherwise showed that that product was
made to fit into the Cube had been crossed out.  I shall be interested to
learn whether your new Sonnet 1.2 Cube will handle the increase in power
that it it is bound to draw.  All the best.
