Hmmm... I haven't succumbed to that one yet. I love my little Cube, 
dearly.  :-) I have been day dreaming about the G5, though.  In fact, 
I've got a gallon of slate gray paint, that was originally for 
something else, and I was thinking of painting my office to match.  How 
sad....  lol

&gt;<i> Perception cube is not &quot;fast&quot; anymore
</I>

Sort of... not so much because of the G5/970 chip itself but more to do 
with all the other features like the 1Ghz FSB, 4x SuperDrive, etc... 
Seems to me that with a Sonnet 1.2Ghz upgrade and a few other items 
that a Cube has the potential of not being really that far behind the 
recent Single PM G4 1.0 and the new G4 1.25Ghz machine they introduced 
this week. So, I don't feel they're approaching obsolescence 'quite' 
yet - at least no more so than most other Power Mac G4s.  :-)

otoh, ask me again this fall when I've actually had a chance to play 
with a G5
&quot;in the flesh&quot;, so to speak.


&gt;<i> Delusional financial scemes encroaching on daily thought processes

OH YEAH, Big Time...

&gt;<i> Right now I am taking advice for and against trying to trade-in 
</I>&gt;<i> somehow, and I guess purchase offers, too...
</I>
Hmmm, it'd have to be a really good offer for me to consider that one I 
guess.  :-)

(G4 Cube 500, 1GB RAM, 120GB HD, CDRW, GF2MX, 1 Year of AppleCare left)

&gt;<i> I have the crt studio display and don't want to part with it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm, I have the 17&quot; CRT Studio Display myself.  I wouldn't mind parting
with that for a 17&quot; LCD, though.  :-)

&gt;<i> I am more and more, these days trying to work on large 3d files and it

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please advise.

Well, depends on how bad you've got G5 disease.  :-)  IMO, the entry 
level 1.6 is not a good bargain, so I'd just pretend it doesn't exist 
and then decide whether selling my Cube would bring me enough in to 
help cover some of the costs of a 1.8 or Dual 2.0 to make it worth 
selling it.
