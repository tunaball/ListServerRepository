<PRE>Quoth Stevie (<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/cube.html">erasmus at t-online.de</A>) at 25/06/2004 4:40 AM:

&gt;<i> Hi friends,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> still I hesitate to upgrade my dear cube.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Reading owner reviews at xlerate your mac, I like their detailed
</I>&gt;<i> informations about the new speed of their cube. Unfortunately they
</I>&gt;<i> end with older processors (relatively old ones, fastest with 1.0 GHz
</I>&gt;<i> and 744x-proc.).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since we now have the opportunity to buy motorola 7457-processors
</I>&gt;<i> (with low watt consumption and cooler but faster) from Sonnet,
</I>&gt;<i> Powerlogix and Gigatech, there's a new circle of decisions coming.(?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> QUESTIONS:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Is there interest in the list to get exact informations from
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;pioneers&quot; between us, who bought 1.2 to 1.5 GHz-Procs with 7457-Chip
</I>&gt;<i> or will buy soon?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) And are those of you, who are using (or buying) these, willing to
</I>&gt;<i> take some measurements to help the rest of us?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (3) And if they want, which tests would be interesting and could
</I>&gt;<i> become common usage for comparison? (we could perhaps orientate to
</I>&gt;<i> xlerate-y-m?)
</I>
Stevie,

I think the best resource for Cube upgrades is the forum at cubeowner.com.
You should also look at the results at xbench.com and macsales.com for
performance comparisons. There are a number of people, based on the posts at
Cubeowner, who have problems with the Powerlogix 7457 upgrades (myself
included). Fortunately Powerlogix is usually pretty good at resolving these
issues. It will be at least a few days before Giga Designs ships their 7457
upgrades, and Sonnet has not announced any yet. Based strictly on the power
consumption of the earlier processors (I think all of the currently shipping
ones are 7455 variants) I would steer clear of anything other than a 7457
processor. Hope this helps somewhat. Are you participating in Erasmus now?
Your email address made me wonder.

Where in the rhyme does it say Humpty Dumpty was an egg?
