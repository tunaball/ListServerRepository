<PRE>Yup, that's why I like the multi-button optical mouse, which is the 
minimum I recommend.  I prefer wireless because the cable bunches up on 
me as well.  Sure there's still a wireless receiver dongle, but I can 
put that out of the way, behind my computer or somewhere inside my 
desk.  Currently it's right next to my USB hub, somewhere deep within 
my desk.  Also, sure you have to keep batteries in it, but I've had 
mine for 1.5 years now and have replaced the batteries exactly twice.  
Not a big battery eater there. ;)

WIth regards to Chip's question, I have used the Apple Bluetooth mouse 
and found it to be &quot;cool&quot; but not as useful as my IntelliMouse -- and 
not as smooth-tracking.  I was actually quite disappointed in it, so I 
returned it.  (It was a gift from my employer, along with a bluetooth 
Apple keyboard, but I returned it too because I use a split ergonomic 
keyboard.)
