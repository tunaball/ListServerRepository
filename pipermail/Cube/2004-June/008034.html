</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The wireless part of the LAN isn't essentially any different than the wired

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Airport Admin utility gives me THREE choices for a set-up that shares

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -OR-
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can share a RANGE of IP addresses (using DHCP) utilizing a beginning and

</I>&gt;<i> manual or DHCP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I may tackle it again soon, I know a bit more now than I did when I first

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So.. How do you do it with your wired and wireless system?  Did it all fall
</I>&gt;<i> together with the default settings right out of the box?  How many different
</I>&gt;<i> wired computers versus wireless? Are they all using the same flavor of
</I>&gt;<i> operating systems?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm curious.
</I>
The wireless macs all fell together with default settings out of the box.
All were running OS9 when I first set it up. When I moved some over to 
OSX, again the default settings worked. When I first set up the 
airport, I configured it manually, just as I had with the existing 
wired boxes, and chose a range of distributed IP's (I wanted them to 
be static within a range, for mnemonic purposes). I haven't had to 
change any of those original settings since, though I've changed ISP's 4 
times, added wireless devices, moved the whole shebang from one house to 
another, and made innumerable other minor changes, since then.

Present LAN is 4 wireless, 3 macs (OS9 and X), one wintel, plus 9 wired, 4 
macs, 1 wintel, 3 solaris and one NeXT. Operating systems are MacOS 8.6, 
9.2, 10.1 and 10.3. Wintel boxes are XP, 98 and 2k. Solaris 2.7 and 8. NeXTStep 
3.3. And I'm using both an Airport and a Netgear WAP (back-up only), plus 
a Netgear wireless bridge. Everything comes together via two switches and a DSL 
&quot;modem&quot;. The wireless Macs all print to a laser printer that isn't even 
ethernet-ready, and is connected via serial port to an Asante Ethernet 
bridge, as well as to their own, and other wireless mac, USB printers. The 
wireless wintel box prints to two printers (one of which is the 
laser printer, which is also directly connected to one of the 
solaris boxes) directly connected to a wired wintel box.

I can mount filesystems to and from all the boxes without difficulty, 
with the exception of the NeXTStation. That mounts, but fairly quickly 
becomes unusable. But I haven't really explored that, and am 
probably missing something simple. FTP and telnet access to and from all 
the boxes, as well as HTTP, is flawless, to the extent that I've tested it.

That you can ping one way and not the other is a bit unusual. Is it just 
ping that doesn't work? Does the Cube show up on the PB, for filesharing 
purposes? Are you running any sort of firewall, and if so, where? How is 
the airport connected to the wired LAN? Through a switch or router?
