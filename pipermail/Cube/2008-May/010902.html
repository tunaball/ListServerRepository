<PRE>I am new to Macs as well...lotsa PC experience
If you have a software/driver issue I cant help you.

My cube had both usb jacks physically broken.
The little plastic spacers were broken and missing
When you inserted the usb sound cable it would not work
The pins were all bent and mangled as a result

Hopefully both of your usb jacks are fully functional
To test,  try your keyboard in either jack

I replaced both usb jacks on the logic board...no easy task
I also had to take apart the sound board case and repair a potential 
Wiring problem, as the audio output cable had lost its strain relief.

All working now

Just making sure the hardware part of your sound system is functional

Subject: [Cube] sound issue with cube G4

hi

  i recently got a G4 cube for a great deal - it's standard so far, but 
I do intend to do the usual upgrades. My problem is this - the person I 
bought it from forgot their password so i re-installed OS X and it was 
one version higher than what they originally had on there. OS X Panther 
- after installing and getting everything running I found out that the 
sound went away. before the OS install - the sound worked very well - 
now it doesn't even recognize that there is a device there - it seems 
to think there is no sound card at all. huh? I am confused and sort of 
stumped. I'm going to admit it - I'm more of a PC guy when it comes to 
doing tech stuff - I understand that the G4 cube does NOT have any pci 
slots so adding a pci soundcard is out - i know there is one already in 
the machine that works well but i can't even figure out what it is let 
alone find drivers for it. Anyone run accross this issue before? Any 
ideas? help!

Thanks

scott
