<PRE>hi

  i recently got a G4 cube for a great deal - it's standard so far, but 
I do intend to do the usual upgrades. My problem is this - the person I 
bought it from forgot their password so i re-installed OS X and it was 
one version higher than what they originally had on there. OS X Panther 
- after installing and getting everything running I found out that the 
sound went away. before the OS install - the sound worked very well - 
now it doesn't even recognize that there is a device there - it seems 
to think there is no sound card at all. huh? I am confused and sort of 
stumped. I'm going to admit it - I'm more of a PC guy when it comes to 
doing tech stuff - I understand that the G4 cube does NOT have any pci 
slots so adding a pci soundcard is out - i know there is one already in 
the machine that works well but i can't even figure out what it is let 
alone find drivers for it. Anyone run accross this issue before? Any 
ideas? help!

Thanks

scott
