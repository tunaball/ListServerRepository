<PRE>Luis,

it is absolutely not my intention to hurt your 
feelings (I hope you believe me).
But I'm convinced straight truth is always the best.
On the other hand pay attention to the fact, that 
my statements are only personal view and specific 
mainly for the german market.

Our cube may be in exhibited in a museum of 
design, but it is a mass-production-object.

The standard cube you can get for about 150 Euro 
(and that's no bad price!), the RAM and HD aren't 
very interesting for most customers. They make 
perhaps 50 Euros more, I'd say.

The GeForce is a standard card, not a very 
special. There are others, more interesting ones. 
No Euros plus.

The Studio Display is dealed at about 75-120 Euro 
(problem are the ADC and the permanently falling 
prices of new larger displays: I can buy a 22&quot; 
TFT with DVI for 180 Euros now&#138;)

The SuperDrive used for 40 to 50 Euros.

The most important part is the Powerlogix Dual Proc. surely.
May be, you could get 150-250 Euros from an 
enthusiast. But when they aren't looking during 
ebay during the auction that's bad luck for you.
- (Some month ago I looked for such or a similar 
card for my second cube. Only very few are 
offered at all. &gt;&gt;But now that interest has 
disappeared, I think the new Mini will be my next 
wish!&lt;&lt; I could imagine that most of us have the 
feeling that the times of the cube, the upgraded 
especially, are ending&#138;) -

AND
I don't believe that a sale of &quot;all-in-one&quot; will 
bring you just the sum of the added amounts: It 
will bring less. So selling the parts one after 
the other might bring the most. (Not all at once!)

Finally:
I know, it sounds (reads!) terrible, especially 
as I'm convinced your cube is running excellent 
as it is. Maybe, I'm wrong, I would even prefer 
that&#138;

Perhaps someone of us would buy it?


Best regards you happy-unhappy man ;-)

Stefan
