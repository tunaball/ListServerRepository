<PRE>Well, back when the first 22&quot; CHD's were introduced, they were nearly  
$4K US, and when I bought my old lucite 23&quot; CHD as a refurb from the  
Apple Store I got it for about half that (And the 23 is about twice as  
bright as the 22).  By the time I bought my aluminum 23 on eBay, it  
was less than $1K, so the prices on the large format displays have  
dropped about 75% in the last ten years.  If my hunch is right, Apple  
will introduce another large display to replace the 30 with the look  
of the new 24 - I'm betting on 33&quot; with the same resolution as the 30  
- at which point I'd expect the aluminum 30&quot; to follow that trend and  
drop way down to under $2K.  Hey, I could be wrong, but I've seen the  
30 at my local Apple store, and it is the most amazing display I've  
ever seen.  It's actually a bit intimidating to me.  LOL!

~sigh~ But if there's no card for the Cube that can run it, I guess  
that's just another genius idea I had that won't work out.  ;^)

I don't think I'd get another Mini.  If I want the 30 for my living  
room, I'll just pick up another G5.  Sure, it has fans, but they are  
so quiet that I don't hear them at all unless I bend down to listen  
closely.  Still, it's not a Cube.  :-D
