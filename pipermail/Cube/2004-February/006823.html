Although the latest cpu upgrades (7457s) run cooler than the older
generation chips, it's still a good idea to help them stay cool
by putting one of those whisper quiet 80MM fans in the bottom
of the cube.  You won't even notice it.  Try holding a lit match
8-12 inches from your mouth and then blow on it, but not hard enough
to make it go out.  That's about how loud these fans are.  Nothing...

</I>
It's quite a process, and can be a bit intimidating, but with the
assistance of the video (on DVD) that comes with the PowerLogix unit
and some patience, you should be able to accomplish.  I did.

I wish I had the new PowerLogix 7457 1.4Gig, but I jumped earlier
when the older pre-7457(I forget the exact model number) 1.2Gig first
came out, but it boosted the performance so much that I've decided to
hold off on the G5 I had been contemplating.  I Xbenchmark'd at 117.63
(scored a baseline ~46 prior to the upgrades).

Well, enough about me 8^).  Best of luck with your upgrades!

Here's a OWC link that shows several of the available CPUs and the fan:
