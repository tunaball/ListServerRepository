<PRE>I don't know if anybody has mentioned this but here are my thoughts:

A. Your WORK requires Storyview which is a Windows app.

It seems you have some options:

1. Get a DELL (or something) and put it on your network cost: $500 - $700

Advantages: full warranty, immediately useable Windows machine, keep working
Cube untampered, spare machine for other uses (games, file translation from
deadbeat PC apps)

Risks: ??

2. Upgrade Cube, cost (est.):  $500 - $700
Advantages: increase Cube performance, silence, no Windows on network

Risks: 
- dealing with multiple vendors for service if anything goes wrong with
components
- no overall warranty
- significant down time if install goes bad

If this is really work related then option 1 makes more sense, if its a
hobby then option 2 and if work is the reason for going with option 2 that
works too.  Of course I left out scenario 3 which is too horrible for me to
consider which is sell the Cube and get a PC since you still have the iBook
to use and put the PC in a closet as a server.

Its great to have choices, isn't it?

Cheers,

  GS
