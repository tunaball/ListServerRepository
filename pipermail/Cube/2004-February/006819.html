</I>With the PowerLogic I believe that they are using a lower power-draw 
processor so you can do quite well without the fan. The Panaflo fan is 
15 mm thick and Sonnet provide it with a small adapter which plugs into 
the DC/DC board. It runs at 2000 rpm and is very quiet, the main noise 
I get from my Cube is from the GeForce 3 video card fan.  The brackets 
are already there for the fan to be installed - it would seem that 
Apple's original plans included a fan for later inclusion as they 
upgraded the system.

&gt;<i> I've also heard that you need to have a Techician put in the Processor 
</I>&gt;<i> Upgrade, that it needs to be done in what's called a Clean Lab or 
</I>&gt;<i> Environment. What's that all about? Is that true?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not true, the instructions are clear enough, and you can get even more 
information at <A HREF="http://www.cubeowner.com">http://www.cubeowner.com</A> or <A HREF="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com">http://www.xlr8yourmac.com</A> 
just remember my tip about removing the foil, cleaning the faces of the 
heatsinks and using a smear of silicone thermal paste. Actually, the 
fan is more trouble, you have to take more of the cube apart but it's 
still easy to do (good grief, I did it!).

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, the 120Gb drive is a worthwhile investment, I have kept the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 20Gb
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drive and put it in an external Firewire enclosure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great idea. Where does one get an external Firewire enclosure?
</I>
I got mine from eBay, but your nearest computer fair or dealer should 
be able to get one for you, a good source is Other World Computing 
(links from either CubeOwner or xlr8yourmac).  I'm not associated with 
them, just a happy customer.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; What I can't figure out just yet is if I can get by with removing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 32 mb memory and putting in a 512 mb next to the two 128s, bringing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; memory to 800 mb.&#160; This would seem, along with the processor upgrade
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and hard drive, to make the operation of the Virtual PC snappy and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; crisp. Is 800 mb enough for what I'm trying to do?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Definitely ditch the 32Mb stick, 768Mb should be fine. I have 1.5Gb of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RAM now and I can't say that there was a huge difference in Xbench
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scores between having 2 x 512Mb over 3 x 512Mb RAM, but that's not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really tested in Xbench in the same way as fooling around with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PhotoShop rendering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to putting this new 
</I>&gt;<i> contraption together. It may take me some time to assemble all the 
</I>&gt;<i> parts due to constrained finances right now, but it shouldn't take too 
</I>&gt;<i> long.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mark
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I can say that having lost skin on the cases of various PCs I've either 
built or repaired over the years, give me a Cube to work on any day.
