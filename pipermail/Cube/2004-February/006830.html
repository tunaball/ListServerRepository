</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Risks: ??
</I>
Your suggestion makes sense, but after working on a PC all day I'd 
rather not own one. Running VPC (which I already have) for this one 
program is more attractive.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Upgrade Cube, cost (est.):&#160; $500 - $700
</I>&gt;<i> Advantages: increase Cube performance, silence, no Windows on network
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Risks:
</I>&gt;<i> - dealing with multiple vendors for service if anything goes wrong with
</I>&gt;<i> components
</I>&gt;<i> - no overall warranty
</I>&gt;<i> - significant down time if install goes bad
</I>
All the upgrades come with warrantys, and I've got a friend who's an 
Apple techy, so I feel confident I can pull this off.  Besides, having 
an Apple to use all the time makes it worth the risk since it seems 
less risky than getting a PC.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is really work related then option 1 makes more sense, if its a
</I>&gt;<i> hobby then option 2 and if work is the reason for going with option 2 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> works too.&#160; Of course I left out scenario 3 which is too horrible for 
</I>&gt;<i> me to
</I>&gt;<i> consider which is sell the Cube and get a PC since you still have the 
</I>&gt;<i> iBook
</I>&gt;<i> to use and put the PC in a closet as a server.
</I>
Have you washed your mouth out with soap yet?  Just the thought of 
selling it now causes me to run to the sink and gargle with Liquid 
Plumber.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its great to have choices, isn't it?
</I>
It is. Before realizing I could upgrade this Cube into something we 
really need instead of getting something new and much more expensive, I 
was completely in the dark about what potential was in our hands.

Thanks.
