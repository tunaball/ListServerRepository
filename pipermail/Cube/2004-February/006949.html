<PRE>sorry to hear that you have such a thin skin, keith.  list netiquette?  
give me a break.  it's a unmoderated list run by a guy that can't even 
be bothered to respond to emails from the members; it's a wonder that 
the list is active and has members at all, let alone some pre-written 
list etiquette.

i've grown weary of nerds who pounce upon, or become list moms 
regarding the content of posts to the list.  for a lot of people on the 
list, it is their only connection to other people for information 
regarding apple products.  instinctively they ask the community to 
which they &quot;belong&quot; first, before searching out other information 
resources.  i believe that it is bad etiquette to pounce on them for 
doing so.  the cube mailing list certainly is cube focused, but it is 
an active community that posts and discusses all sorts of things 
macintosh with some frequency.  i think that's healthy; obviously you 
disagree.  etiquette is helping them (the &quot;offending&quot; poster) out.  
etiquette could also include pointing the poster to other relevant 
resources.  netiquette?  that's the part where you rudely respond to 
the poster that their post is off-topic, provide no helpful 
information, but instead make them feel alienated and bitter about 
posting to the list.  riiight.

besides, it was jesse the cursed first.  bah ha ha haaa.

don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, keith.
