<PRE>Um... I've been off of this list for about a year because I was on the 
road working, but returned because this list is the single best source 
of Cube info, and Mac info in general, that I've ever found... The Cube 
is the most elegant machine Apple has ever created, IMO, and Cube 
owners are among the most knowledgeable and passionate Mac folks around 
[Also, IMO]... I'm no power user by any stretch: I'm a composer who 
uses Macs to create my art and conduct my business... I use the Apple 
forums, but often get no response to questions I post there [Probably 
because my questions are so dumb]... My recent question about Software 
Update is a good example: Even after going through OS X beta, OS X.i, 
and OS X.ii, I still have only a tenuous grasp of some of the simplest 
stuff [Sorry]... Now, if I may be allowed to toot my own horn for a 
sec, I do consider myself to be a virtuoso end-user of some of the 
music programs I use... If you ever have a question about GVOX Encore, 
feel free to ask! ;^)... OTOH, I often need help with the OS and 
hardware issues... For example, I bought an Xserve and set it up as a 
client machine so I could have a Digital Audio Workstation with a ton 
of HD storage space... You WOULD NOT BELIEVE how much trouble I went 
through to make this happen! [Let me see: Had to buy a 17&quot; CRT monitor 
so I could install OS X client and the ATI software, went to install 
the Radeon and discovered I needed an Xserve proprietary AGP riser 
card, had to get a MacSense AeroPad to get the Xserve onto my AirPort 
network because I didn't want to waste a PCI slot... And some other 
minor pains]... And I STILL have not been able to find out what my 
options are for replacing the tray-loading CD-ROM drive with a 
tray-loading DVD-ROM drive or Combo drive!... No response in the Apple 
forums to this question at all... I don't want to be afraid of asking 
questions like that here [Rationalization: My Xserve, Cube, and iBook 
are all connected to my AirPort network, and my iPod is connected to my 
Cube, so ALL my questions are Cube related ;^D]...

I think it would be common courtesy to clearly label non-Cube specific 
posts with an &quot;OT&quot; in the subject line, but if we are all going to get 
jumped whenever we have an OT issue, then I think this list's uses will 
be greatly diminished [Perhaps I'm the only one who feels this way]... 
Just my humble $0.02...

Sorry for the ramble... Just finished sorting through last years 
receipts for my taxes... Arrrrg! ;^/...
