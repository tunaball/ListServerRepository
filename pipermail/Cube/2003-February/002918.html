<PRE>What Seth said. Big Hard Drive followed by Processor Upgrade as much as 
you can afford. I hear from a friend that the 1.2 GHz upgrade is cheap, 
fast, cool and quiet. You mean you have 1 GB RAM which is enough. The 
umbilical 105 (your new term I love it) will solve your iDVD 3 issue. 
It's all inside to the Cube's brain.
