<PRE>Richard-
I know that my iPod had a scroll wheel that would spin when I walked, or
even in the breeze it seemed, and I fixed it by adding a little heavy
modelling grease into the bearing area. Just use an exacto knife to pop the
wheel and center button off. (I got the grease at an RC hobby store). This
solved the problem for me...

</I>&gt;<i> defective so it was really not usable.

</I>&gt;<i> I did the rma on line with the apple site and in 2 days a nice little

</I>&gt;<i> is Italy i'll get it back six months from now,
</I>&gt;<i> to my surprise 2 days later it was on my doorstep (i was thinking wow
</I>&gt;<i> Apple) until i opened the box and saw a letter stating that the ipod
</I>&gt;<i> was fine. So i called up Apple Italy and as i already knew they are
</I>&gt;<i> useless (experience with one of my cubes) after three days i got them
</I>&gt;<i> to transfer me to someone that spoke english (in Ireland) and he said
</I>&gt;<i> he would see what he could do. after another two days he got back to me
</I>&gt;<i> via email and said there is nothing he could do and he would talk to
</I>&gt;<i> his supervisor, His super a very nice lady by the way explained that
</I>&gt;<i> Apple had not given them any means to repair problems with scroll
</I>&gt;<i> wheels so there was nothing she could do, I said give me a new one if
</I>&gt;<i> you can't fix it she said she couldn't she told me to send it in again
</I>&gt;<i> in a few months and maybe apple would have gotten their act together
</I>&gt;<i> for doing service on the pod.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After a few months i sent it back and it came back to me two days later
</I>&gt;<i> just like before they didn't even look at it they said my 90 day
</I>&gt;<i> warranty was up, seriously getting pissed i called back again and
</I>&gt;<i> explained to the guy in Ireland that in Europe it is law that all
</I>&gt;<i> products have a one year warranty and there is nothing on the box that
</I>&gt;<i> states otherwise. I was told i was correct but for some reason the
</I>&gt;<i> Italian Apple don't know the laws in their own country.
</I>&gt;<i> I was told that they still hadn't gotten their act together and to send
</I>&gt;<i> it back again after a few months.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point i sent two letters to apple explaining the situation
</I>&gt;<i> hoping that they would tell me something as of now still no reply i
</I>&gt;<i> think it has been almost a year.or maybe more i lost track.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So here i am still with my useless IPod and i just found out that the
</I>&gt;<i> remotes not the earphones are available and work with the 5gig so i
</I>&gt;<i> figured i'd get one of those so i can finally take my ipod around
</I>&gt;<i> instead of leaving it sitting on my desk.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> by the way Apple never did replace my case on my cube nor the dvd that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't eject disks from the first day i got it for the dvd i pulled it
</I>&gt;<i> apart and fixed it myself and the case i've almost learned to live with
</I>&gt;<i> it.
