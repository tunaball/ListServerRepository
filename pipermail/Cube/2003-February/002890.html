<PRE>This is a very subjective thing. I am sure that what I suggest will 
probably be attacked by someone else on this list. Like you, I have 4 
partitions on a 100 GB WD drive inside. But I can pass on what I have 
learned, my OS partitions are too small. If I was doing it again I 
would make:

1st Partition (the one at the top) OS X 	................... 20GB
2nd Partition (the next one) OS 9.2.2 	................... 10GB
3rd Partition ( third from the top) Virtual PC ............ 10-20GB
I really have no idea what size it should be. I would call Microsoft 
Tech support or Connectix if they are still doing the tech support 
Monday morning and ask them what they think the size should be.
4th Partition (the bottom one) Others. The amount that is left. (about 
&#177;70 GB)

I have a huge number of applications in my applications folder. What is 
forgotten is that OS X grows over time. Mail, iChat, Downloads (since 
moved to another partition) and other growth files keep stressing my 
little 8GB OS X and OS 9 partitions. This is my personal suggestion and 
not an expert recommendation. I don't want to be personally attacked 
for telling you what I think. I speak for no one else and I am not a 
partition expert.
