<PRE>&gt;<i> Sounds Like the new imac G4 would be perfect for you.
</I>
If they have the money to afford one, I'd be inclined to agree.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically CUBE owners love their machines for aesthetic reasons-clean, 
</I>&gt;<i> quiet and powerful
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I think the G4 imac has eclipsed the CUBE for the basic user in 
</I>&gt;<i> terms of simplicity of design
</I>
Well,  if you already have a good monitor, you're paying for something 
you don't need (though you may want it anyway).  Also,  the cube's are 
still a bit more expandable than the imac.  If you are talking about 
spending $2000, you can get a cube, a geforce3, a bigger hard drive, 
1.5 Gig ram, and a 1.2 GHz processor upgrade for your ram.  Personally 
I think the screen on the 15 inch imac is a little small, and it's 
specs are mediocre in comparison to the 17 inch model.

&gt;<i> emac is just the old imac with G4 processor and the flat CRT screen
</I>
It has a much larger, and better screen than the old imac.  My friend 
has one and it is a very nice little box.  It's also significantly 
cheaper.  Since the original poster mentioned cost as a major factor, I 
wouldn't be so dismissive of the emac.  Especially since it would be 
replacing an 8 year old machine.  I think it's a really good choice for 
a lot of people.

&gt;<i> I can't think of a reason not too for basic home use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless you were looking at the old imac-kinda boring now just to save 
</I>&gt;<i> a few $$$
</I>
That's a possibility.  It would certainly be a lot better than his 
current machine.  But for just a few hundred dollars more the upgrade 
to the emac would give a significant advantage.  Unless cost were 
absolutely prohibitive, i'd say the emac is definitely worth the extra 
$ over the old crt imacs.

&gt;<i> Consider the ibook?
</I>
This is a very good option to consider.  They are cheap, and they are 
fantastic little machines.  Plus you can plug in a usb keyboard/mouse 
and an external monitor and you have a super little desktop as well.
