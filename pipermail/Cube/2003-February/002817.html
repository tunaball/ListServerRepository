<PRE>In my opinion, upgrading from the stock video card to the GF2MX or 
Radeon is worth it. This was the first upgrade I did to my machine 
(GF2MX) and it was definitely worth it. You get to take advantage of 
quartz extreme and better framerates in games and the excess heat is 
not that big a deal. I didn't add a fan to my machine until I upgraded 
again to the GF3.

The upgrade takes a few minutes and it's dead simple to do. No matter 
which card you upgrade to (assuming it's a OEM GF2MX, Radeon or GF3), 
you'll just swap the bracket from your existing video card over to the 
new one. That adds maybe 5 minutes to the process, if you're slow with 
a screwdriver.

I've tried all 3 of the OEM cards, and they're all great and easy to 
install. It's only when you get to the &quot;unsupported&quot; cards that things 
get a little (or a lot) more complicated.

good luck!
