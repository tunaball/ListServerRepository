<PRE>Well I just did what you should have done before you posted this 
paragraph. I also didn't do what you should have done as well. I went 
to the Samsung website and tracked down your printer model and found 
that there are no Mac drivers for your model. Since the printer is 
discontinued, you can bet there never will be. You should call their 
toll free technical support tomorrow and ask them point blank to 
confirm this.

The thing is, I bought a brand new USB Samsung ML-1430 Laser Printer 
the day after Thanksgiving at Fry's for $129. I don't know about you, 
but the last time I purchased a laser printer ink cartridge it was at 
least for that much money.

The point is, if I am right and that old ML-4500 won't work with your 
new Mac, I wouldn't sweat it and go out and buy a new Samsung Laser 
Printer for next to nothing.

I am an old Mac user. I had access to the first Laser Printer that was 
hidden inside the corporate walls in Cupertino in December of 1984. 
Most of the members of this list were still in grade school when I was 
printing out the first publication that ever came out of a secret Apple 
laser printer inside a secret storeroom inside corporate headquarters 
in Cupertino. When they went on sale in January 1985, I was one of the 
first to buy one. I think I paid about $3,000 with the developer 
discount. I can tell you that this $129 Samsung ML-1430 is radically 
more powerful than that 1985 Apple laster printer version 1. And the 
toner cartridges were more than $129 each.
