<PRE>Rich C has successfully done the unthinkable &#8212; got a Pioneer DVR-105 
SuperDrive outside his Cube running into the Core back in its Case.

He used
1. A round 6&quot; IDE extension cable Male to Female FROM the Cube's Female 
out and
2. A round 6&quot; Male to Female IDE cable attached to the 105's Male Pins 
Out in
3. An old Apple CD-ROM case. I think the case is optional and strictly 
for aesthetics.

For power he just attached
4. A stock Y power adapter to the Cube's optical power connector and 
strung the rest outside the Core along with the optical's flat IDE 
cable. It's a tight squeeze, but they fit between the Core and the Case 
as you slide it back in. I really didn't think that the Core could fit 
back in the Case with anything between its edge and the Case. I was 
wrong.

So it looks like we have a sound aesthetically acceptable alternative 
to the more expensive, yet to be available and much slower slot load 
DVD-RW drive coming up.

I'll go price the cables tomorrow. It isn't going to be much. Probably 
$10-$15 max for all three. Plus a case if you don't heve one laying 
around. A shoe box with holes cut in each end will do. A case is 
strictly optional for aesthetic reasons.

Congratulations on a great modification Rich C. Excellent job. I now 
see how easy it is to do once the concept of round IDE extension cables 
is understood along with the idea that you can put those cables between 
the Core and the Case as you slide the Core back in.
