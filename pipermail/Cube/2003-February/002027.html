<PRE>Ok i see that you want the whole story Laurie so i'll give it to you :) 
i bought the ipod for almost a grand and the damn scroll wheel was 
defective it would spin even if breathed on here in Italy isn't like 
America if you buy something you need to keep it the store won't take 
it back or trade it for another one if it's defective you need to send 
it in for warranty even if you bought it 5 mins before anyway this was 
defective so it was really not usable.

I did the rma on line with the apple site and in 2 days a nice little 
box showed up at the door and i sent my ipod off to apple thinking this 
is Italy i'll get it back six months from now,
to my surprise 2 days later it was on my doorstep (i was thinking wow 
Apple) until i opened the box and saw a letter stating that the ipod 
was fine. So i called up Apple Italy and as i already knew they are 
useless (experience with one of my cubes) after three days i got them 
to transfer me to someone that spoke english (in Ireland) and he said 
he would see what he could do. after another two days he got back to me 
via email and said there is nothing he could do and he would talk to 
his supervisor, His super a very nice lady by the way explained that 
Apple had not given them any means to repair problems with scroll 
wheels so there was nothing she could do, I said give me a new one if 
you can't fix it she said she couldn't she told me to send it in again 
in a few months and maybe apple would have gotten their act together 
for doing service on the pod.


After a few months i sent it back and it came back to me two days later 
just like before they didn't even look at it they said my 90 day 
warranty was up, seriously getting pissed i called back again and 
explained to the guy in Ireland that in Europe it is law that all 
products have a one year warranty and there is nothing on the box that 
states otherwise. I was told i was correct but for some reason the 
Italian Apple don't know the laws in their own country.
I was told that they still hadn't gotten their act together and to send 
it back again after a few months.

At this point i sent two letters to apple explaining the situation 
hoping that they would tell me something as of now still no reply i 
think it has been almost a year.or maybe more i lost track.

So here i am still with my useless IPod and i just found out that the 
remotes not the earphones are available and work with the 5gig so i 
figured i'd get one of those so i can finally take my ipod around 
instead of leaving it sitting on my desk.

by the way Apple never did replace my case on my cube nor the dvd that 
doesn't eject disks from the first day i got it for the dvd i pulled it 
apart and fixed it myself and the case i've almost learned to live with 
it.
