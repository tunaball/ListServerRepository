There's an &quot;unless.&quot;  I don't know if Apple's window system lets 
applications write directly to the screen (X11 does not).  I think 3D 
games/OpenGL can.  In that case, unless the application is threaded the 
second processor doesn't help much.

&gt;<i>   &quot;Window Manager&quot; on my system has two active threads (at the 
</I>&gt;<i> moment).  What I'm trying to say here is that Unix itself will utilize 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple processors if they are present to schedule processes and

</I>
Actually, you've hit the nail on the head.  That is the #1 reason (to 
me) for having a dual.  It will make the &quot;user experience&quot; MUCH 
smoother.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, under OS X, you don't need &quot;special applications&quot; that are coded 
</I>&gt;<i> to be &quot;SMP-aware&quot; to benefit from multiple processors.  All programs 
</I>&gt;<i> under OS X can and will benefit from SMP.
</I>
Well, it depends on what you mean by &quot;benefit&quot; but sure.

&gt;<i> Notice that the top line shows &quot;129 threads&quot;  but what interests me 
</I>&gt;<i> more is looking at specific apps here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dreamweaver has 5 threads.  (column &quot;#TH&quot;) Lot's of opportunity for 
</I>&gt;<i> parallelism
</I>&gt;<i> Mail has 5 as well.
</I>&gt;<i> and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It depends on what those threads are doing.  Recently I read a 
discussion saying that all OSX apps have two threads:  one for sound 
and one for UI.  If that is true, unless you're musically inclined, the 
second processor is not helping.  Another issue is that threads are 
often used to support asynchronous I/O (like network communication).  
In that case the threads don't ever help because you're really waiting 
for the disk or network.

A better way of figuring how much a second processor will help is to 
use ps instead of top.  What matters is whether you consistently have 
more than one process in the &quot;runnable&quot; state.  That means it's waiting 
for the CPU (or has the CPU; i.e. actually running).  That's denoted by 
the R under the STAT column when you do a
	ps -aux

On a single processor you'll usually see that only the ps is in the R 
state.

Hopefully we're not boring the rest of you to death.
