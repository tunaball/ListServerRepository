<PRE>There is no &quot;pissing contest&quot; going on here. Seth is proposing this 
flashed ROM PC GeForce 3 that is priced about the same as an Apple OEM 
GeForce 3 (&gt;$200) that IS TwinView as if it might be a better deal. One 
thing that might make that true is if it is also TwinView. So far the 
evidence is that it may not be. If not, this new card option may not be 
nearly as attractive as if it is.

This is not meant to be an attack on Seth for his discovery. I and 
others on the list are grateful to Seth for the find. And the 
discussion is about the details of this new choice. That's what this 
list is for, sharing different points of view and posing questions that 
help us all understand more about what's going on out there.

I am trying to find out the facts of the matter on behalf of those list 
members who would like to know. How that is perceived as a &quot;pissing 
contest&quot; is beyond my ability to comprehend. I'm sure there are a 
number of list members who would also like to know the answer to that 
question. Just because you and Hal are not interested doesn't mean 
other list members aren't. You have quite the gaul to think that you 
speak for all list members. I am certain you don't, just as I am 
certain that I don't either.
