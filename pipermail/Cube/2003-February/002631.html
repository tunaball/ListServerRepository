<PRE>I think the question was concerning Apple approved video cards
for the Cube that did not have a fan.  The Radeon 7500 has never
been approved by Apple for use in a Cube, fan or no fan.

And then there is the definition of 'fits' , several video cards 'fit'
in the cube, some require drilling new holes in the base, but they do
indeed fit. Some require new mounting plates like the 2MX Twinview
and the Radeon 7500, or you can run them without a proper mount
and accept the risk that the card may get pulled out of it's socket
while running, blowing up the card or the cube for both. Then there
are the cards like the Radeon 8500 and 9000 that 'fit' if you relocate
the DC-DC board. The only cards installed using an Apple original mounting
plate are the Rage128,  BTO Geforce2 and BTO Radeon. There was also a
Matrox Dualhead card for the cube, but I've never seen one for sale.

As far as fans go, only the original Rage128 never had a fan, the BTO
Geforce2MX had a huge heatsink that covered nearly the whole card,
there are some later cards that dont have this, but it's not clear is they
were oversights by Apple or a lower powered version of the card.
The BTO Radeon did not have a heatsink at first, but a number of them failed
and some BTO Radeon Cubes had videocard fans. No Cube was ever
shipped by Apple with a 80mm base fan.
