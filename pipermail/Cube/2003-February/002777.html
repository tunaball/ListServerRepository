<PRE>Kunga, no one is obligated to help you. If you don't know how to flash the
ROM on a video card, that's YOUR problem, not anyone else's. It really is a
no-brainer, and maybe if you don't understand how to flash a card, you
really shouldn't be doing it in the first place! Maybe you should spend some
time learning how to use GOOGLE instead if insisting that other people just
give you the answers. Honestly, the way you treat people that may know more
than you do, it's a wonder that anyone is ever willing to help you with
anything. Try asking politely and taking your chances instead of verbally
assaulting people in order to get help and attention. If you do a little bit
of the work yourself (a simple search engine query), people might be able to
assist you the rest of the way.

On 2/18/03 3:10 AM, <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/cube.html">Kunga at FutureMedia.org</A> added a note to the human
symphony, when this was said:

&gt;<i> As far as I am concerned, I am deeply grateful for Sean for opening my
</I>&gt;<i> eyes to the other fanless TwinView choices I was unaware of.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am currently trying to get the man who started that string at
</I>&gt;<i> CubeOwner.com to come back and explain himself. It is one thing for you
</I>&gt;<i> to reveal that the PC ATI Radeon 7000 AGP card can be flashed to work
</I>&gt;<i> in the Cube with S-Video to boot. But I read every post on that string
</I>&gt;<i> and there is no way in hell anyone can understand how to do it based on
</I>&gt;<i> any of that information unless they are some sort of ROM flashing
</I>&gt;<i> genius. This guy mcCoy just had the audacity to write back to me that
</I>&gt;<i> he had no idea that there was anything else to write about his secret
</I>&gt;<i> hack. The last post before my new one tonight was 11 days ago with a
</I>&gt;<i> fellow Cube Owner asking HOW. Duh.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It really chaffs my hide when someone like Sean says you can put a PC
</I>&gt;<i> ATI Radeon 7000 AGP cards in our beloved Cubes like it's a no brainer
</I>&gt;<i> when in fact it is just the opposite. The Apple OEM 7500 is a no
</I>&gt;<i> brainer. The PC ATI Radeon 7000 AGP is NOT a no brainer. It is going to
</I>&gt;<i> take many more hours of hard work to drag the HOW TO out of mcCoy. He
</I>&gt;<i> is the only one that knows how to do it who has revealed himself to the
</I>&gt;<i> community so far.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nobody else is coming forward to explain how to do it. I have a PC. I
</I>&gt;<i> can do it. But not without instructions for IDIOTS. I am a certified
</I>&gt;<i> IDIOT and I resent people on this list making caviler statements that
</I>&gt;<i> have so much genius required to accomplish that IDIOTS like me have to
</I>&gt;<i> feel stupid. I am not stupid. But I am an IDIOT. And as such I need
</I>&gt;<i> instructions for DUMMYS and IDIOTS. PLEASE.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If there is anyone else on this list who knows how to flash ROMS on AGP
</I>&gt;<i> cards that were made for the PC with Mac ROM software, I have the kit
</I>&gt;<i> from mcCoy. But I have no clue how to use it. He sent it to me tonight
</I>&gt;<i> without instructions on how to use it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also think it is offensive for anyone on this list to treat it as an
</I>&gt;<i> adjunct to any website. This list needs to remain stand alone with it's
</I>&gt;<i> own strings of information sets. Lazy links to websites that don't
</I>&gt;<i> really explain anything are a waste of our time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I promise to publish the how to do this flash ROM here first if nobody
</I>&gt;<i> else does first.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> k
