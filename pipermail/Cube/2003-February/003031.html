Don't really know what to write Jeff i had an old syquest cartridge 
40mb drive that used to drive me crazy with the fan that would speed up 
and slow down constantly at the time i guessed it was a power problem 
could never be bothered to open it up because the drive worked fine. 
The other day i came across it and decided to open it up and that is 
what i found the little thermo-resistor thing, don't really know what 
it is really called but i'm sure someone here does. Anyway pulled it 
out as you can see in the pics and added it to my fan that was already 
in the cube pretty simple, only thing i did strange was to get my power 
from inside the molex connector that is on the hd instead of buying the 
adapter that everyone uses to get power from the optical drive power 
connector, i also found it much easier to work with the wires under my 
airport slot where there is plenty of room instead of pulling apart the 
chassis of my cube again. I also upgraded my HD without pulling off the 
top plate. Anyway about the parts look at the pic you can see the 
writing on it maybe you can pick up something like this from radio 
shack if your in the US.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just finished adding a thermostat to the fan in my cube when the cube 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is cool the fan gets about 6 volts when things heat up the fan speeds 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up so far working great, I posted some pictures on www.cubeowner.com 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the gallery under cube parts if anyone wants to take a look.
