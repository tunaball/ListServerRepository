I have been feeling a little guilty about causing so many people out there to have nightmares, depression and sickness 
from my little joke. This is why I am responding to Macosrumors.com. The reaction of people word wide has blown me away. 
I never intended for such a thing to happen. My in box went from 1% to 100% in 2 days (1300 messages). So many people 
were pointing out what a stupid thing to do, so many people were telling me of feeling sick, some even said they cried. 
I felt bad for those people. It was amusing to read things like &quot;I should be hung by my testicles and lit on fire&quot; or 
the constant reference to &quot;taking a porche and replacing the engine with a KIAs&quot;. Most people cried out in horror and 
carfully pointed out the error of doing such a silly thing.

I am sure you are wondering why this all took place.
Are the pictures real? yes.
Is it my own G5 case that has been cut and hacked? yes.
Did I give away two G5 2GHz processors (IBM PC 970)? no!
&lt; So what happened?

I got a free G5 shell from a buddy of mine and pulled a prank on a mac loving friend. he got so upset. I decided write 
up a little story, my imagination and warped sense of humor kicked in. I sent it to OC.com just to see their reaction. I 
honestly didn't think they were going to post it. I cannot believe how fast or how far it has spread on the internet. 
There are an amazing number of people who are emotionally attached to inanimate objects such as computers. Mac fans seem 
to be much worse than I ever expected. The G5 is amazing, I would never dream of really doing that ;)
