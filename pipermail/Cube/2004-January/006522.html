<PRE>I wasn't burgled, my daughter took my Cube to her new apartment close 
to school.  She likes it for all the standard &quot;Cube reasons&quot; - so did 
I, but she wanted to lose her PC and use something more in line with 
the systems and software she uses at school.  Anyhow, I replaced it 
with an iBook.  It does all I used the Cube for with an added degree of 
mobility and takes up only a little more desk space.  10.3 runs fine on 
it.

The only thing I miss is the options I had for a display.  The iBook is 
VGA only.  Using the LCD on the iBook takes up a lot less desk space 
that the Cube used but is a little hard for these old eyes to handle.  
Still looking for a nice 1024*768 LCD monitor.
