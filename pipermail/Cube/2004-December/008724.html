<PRE>This just in from Ambrosia (I have been using the free Wire Tap):

Rochester, NY -- December 20, 2004 -- Today Ambrosia Software, Inc. 
announced the release of WireTap Pro: your all-purpose digital 
recording device.  With the click of a button, WireTap Pro allows you 
to record any audio on your Mac. WireTap Pro's simple but powerful 
interface allows you to record audio from any running applications, 
as well as from any microphone, line-in, headset, and even your 
radioSHARK.

Want to record sound snippets from your favorite DVD movie, digitize 
your old record collection, record streaming audio from the Internet, 
or even use your iPod as a personal Dictaphone? WireTap Pro is your 
solution.  Download it and try it out for free now:

  <A HREF="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/">http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/</A>

WireTap Pro can save your digital recordings in the popular .mp3, 
AAC, QuickTime, and AIFF file formats, saving them to your hard drive 
for later processing/listening. WireTap Pro can also save your 
recordings directly into iTunes, or onto your iPod or other 
iTunes-compatible .mp3 player. You have total control over the file 
format, compression, and quality of your recordings.

Using presets, you can automatically save your digital music in high 
quality .mp3 format, your voice recordings in a more compressed, 
space-saving AAC format, or your DVD clips in uncompressed AIFF 
format... all with the click of one button. But wait, it gets better.

To facilitate recording streaming audio from the Internet, WireTap 
Pro integrates tightly with Apple's iCal, allowing you to schedule 
recording sessions that will automatically start up a streaming audio 
feed, and record it unattended. Never miss your favorite BBC Radio or 
NPR program again!

Even better: WireTap Pro recording sessions can be saved as &quot;Packaged 
Sessions&quot; that you can download, or send to a friend. Just a 
double-click will instantly make that recording session available to 
anyone who has WireTap Pro.

WireTap Pro's simple, appliance-like user interface and broad feature 
set makes it the total audio recording solution. It's even fun to 
use. Download it now, and give it a whirl... the free trial version 
is on us.

WireTap Pro costs $19, and a free trial version is available.

Ambrosia Software, Inc. - publisher of award winning programs for the 
Macintosh and Windows - distributes a full line of utility, 
productivity, and anti-productivity (game) software through the 
Internet as shareware. Unregistered versions of Ambrosia's products 
on CD can be obtained at Ambrosia web site, 
<A HREF="http://www.AmbrosiaSW.com/">http://www.AmbrosiaSW.com/</A> or by calling Ambrosia's order center at
