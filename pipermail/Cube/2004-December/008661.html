</I>&gt;<i> Didn't read Stuart's post, but I presume he was inquiring about the included fan. Mine was also a panaflo that worked OK out of the box, opposite to the CPU. Mine was not loud at all, as I had to put my hear over the top vent to notice it working.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Next time I perform a CPU upgrade (if I'll ever do it again), EVERYTHING will be backed up into DVDs first. Inside this terrible nightmare, I was lucky enough to get my zombie HDDs back to life again - Thank you so much Alsoft! -  DiskWarrior ran continiously but effectively over my external FW 160Gb Samsung hard disk for almost 48 hrs. &lt; sigh &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Is there any explanation for this phenomenon?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't know if there is/ever was an explanation for this 'phenomenon' to take place. If there's one, must be under PL's secret files, as they didn't give me a conclusion. I took the suggestion of another Cube user, who thought it could be the hdd clock (ATA 100), so I've downclocked it to 66 using a friend's PC. (There's a utility at Seagate website but it is windows only). Didn't work out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I performed a CPU+SuperDrive upgrade, and the items were both bought in USA. I took the chance of being visited by an american friend of mine and he offered himself to buy and bring me the items. So I also took the chance of saying 'see you soon' to my friend one week later and I've put the CPU+SuperDrive package in his rucksack back to USA, as I didn't want a SD in my Cube with the original 450MHz CPU. Don't know if PL 'accepted' the problem, but my money is there for me to pick up whatever I want. But I for sure don't want any other PL CPU upgrade.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My Cube firmware version is (actually was, prior to this adventure) the latest for Cubes - 4.1.9f and was (as far as I recall) necessary for a Mac OS 9.2.x installation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sonnet or Giga will be my next bets. Don't know which though. I'd love to preserve a silent Cube, and it seems that will only be possible through GigaDesigns... &quot;The Cube upgrade supports fan less operation at 1.6GHz, and 1.7GHz+ operation with the addition of a low speed fan.&quot; Giga uses the latest 7447A Freescale chips, and they claim to be the coolest ones out there for Cubes.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, Sonnet gets the best reputation concerning stability, but it seems they have not fixed the 'deep sleep coma' yet... &quot;The Encore/ST supports hard disk and display sleep in all compatible PowerMac G4 computers. In some configurations, deep sleep may not be supported.&quot; Sonnet uses the 7457 chips, same that were used by PL for their 1.35GHz chips... that gives me the creeps.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Luis, hello Stuart,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for answering.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To Stuart first: Together with the upgrade I built in a Panaflo-fan, 
</I>&gt;<i> that works great (that means: much better than the processor :-)). A 
</I>&gt;<i> little noisy, but effective.
</I>&gt;<i> The power consumption should also be no question, because especially 
</I>&gt;<i> this 7457 has a very low wish of power (Powerlogix tell's us...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To Luis:
</I>&gt;<i> That sounds like the story of twins. Just the same problems: My 
</I>&gt;<i> FW-HDs were all corrupted and because I was too optimistic (will 
</I>&gt;<i> never be again, I swear!) I first lost all of my data. On the most 
</I>&gt;<i> important disk I could save them, but a second large disk is 
</I>&gt;<i> physically or electrically dead.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any explanation for this phenomenon?
</I>&gt;<i> Did Powerlogix in your case accept the problem and did you get back your money?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could/would you be so kind as to take a look onto your cube's 
</I>&gt;<i> firmware-Version (boot ROM)?
</I>&gt;<i> When trying to install/update it with 4.1.9 ROM Update you will get 
</I>&gt;<i> the information.
</I>&gt;<i> By the time: I didn't get this information with System Profiler 
</I>&gt;<i> either with OS 9 nor with OS-X.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looking forward: What do you/what do you all think about the new 
</I>&gt;<i> Sonnet-upgrade with 1.7 GHz???
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't read anything about (1) cache (2) processor-type or (3) 
</I>&gt;<i> power-consumption.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for new answers

I wouldn't buy a PowerLogix product if they paid me. I have been lied to 
, made to wait without any reason and lost about 300 $ in the deal. 
Installing and using a PL product in a Cube or any other precious Mac is 
like playing hardware Russian roulette.

Sorry to read about your problem btw.

Nicolas
