<PRE>Hi Stefan,

Didn't read Stuart's post, but I presume he was inquiring about the included fan. Mine was also a panaflo that worked OK out of the box, opposite to the CPU. Mine was not loud at all, as I had to put my hear over the top vent to notice it working.

Next time I perform a CPU upgrade (if I'll ever do it again), EVERYTHING will be backed up into DVDs first. Inside this terrible nightmare, I was lucky enough to get my zombie HDDs back to life again - Thank you so much Alsoft! -  DiskWarrior ran continiously but effectively over my external FW 160Gb Samsung hard disk for almost 48 hrs. &lt; sigh &gt;

&gt;<i> Is there any explanation for this phenomenon?
</I>Don't know if there is/ever was an explanation for this 'phenomenon' to take place. If there's one, must be under PL's secret files, as they didn't give me a conclusion. I took the suggestion of another Cube user, who thought it could be the hdd clock (ATA 100), so I've downclocked it to 66 using a friend's PC. (There's a utility at Seagate website but it is windows only). Didn't work out.

I performed a CPU+SuperDrive upgrade, and the items were both bought in USA. I took the chance of being visited by an american friend of mine and he offered himself to buy and bring me the items. So I also took the chance of saying 'see you soon' to my friend one week later and I've put the CPU+SuperDrive package in his rucksack back to USA, as I didn't want a SD in my Cube with the original 450MHz CPU. Don't know if PL 'accepted' the problem, but my money is there for me to pick up whatever I want. But I for sure don't want any other PL CPU upgrade.

My Cube firmware version is (actually was, prior to this adventure) the latest for Cubes - 4.1.9f and was (as far as I recall) necessary for a Mac OS 9.2.x installation.

Sonnet or Giga will be my next bets. Don't know which though. I'd love to preserve a silent Cube, and it seems that will only be possible through GigaDesigns... &quot;The Cube upgrade supports fan less operation at 1.6GHz, and 1.7GHz+ operation with the addition of a low speed fan.&quot; Giga uses the latest 7447A Freescale chips, and they claim to be the coolest ones out there for Cubes.

&lt; <A HREF="http://www.gigadesigns.com/news.html">http://www.gigadesigns.com/news.html</A> &gt;

On the other hand, Sonnet gets the best reputation concerning stability, but it seems they have not fixed the 'deep sleep coma' yet... &quot;The Encore/ST supports hard disk and display sleep in all compatible PowerMac G4 computers. In some configurations, deep sleep may not be supported.&quot; Sonnet uses the 7457 chips, same that were used by PL for their 1.35GHz chips... that gives me the creeps.

Stefan: you're welcome to post further questions/opinions/hints/whatever.

</I>Hello Luis, hello Stuart,

thanks for answering.

To Stuart first: Together with the upgrade I built in a Panaflo-fan, 
that works great (that means: much better than the processor :-)). A 
little noisy, but effective.
The power consumption should also be no question, because especially 
this 7457 has a very low wish of power (Powerlogix tell's us...)

To Luis:
That sounds like the story of twins. Just the same problems: My 
FW-HDs were all corrupted and because I was too optimistic (will 
never be again, I swear!) I first lost all of my data. On the most 
important disk I could save them, but a second large disk is 
physically or electrically dead.
Is there any explanation for this phenomenon?
Did Powerlogix in your case accept the problem and did you get back your money?

Could/would you be so kind as to take a look onto your cube's 
firmware-Version (boot ROM)?
When trying to install/update it with 4.1.9 ROM Update you will get 
the information.
By the time: I didn't get this information with System Profiler 
either with OS 9 nor with OS-X.

Looking forward: What do you/what do you all think about the new 
Sonnet-upgrade with 1.7 GHz???
I didn't read anything about (1) cache (2) processor-type or (3) 
power-consumption.

Thanks for new answers
Stefan
