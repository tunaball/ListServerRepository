<PRE>Hello Luis,

thanks for answering.
Another friendly guy in the list has sent me the patches (CD-Image). 
I don't want to write his name here, maybe there are legal question 
related...(?)

As I heard, it is not necessary to remove the 7457 patches. They are 
just a plus to the normal firmware, no alternative.
I also could solve the OS 9-problems, but I don't understand them at 
all... (???)

Next days I shall send you all measurements (watt-numbers) about my 
new GigaDesigns-Upgrade.
It's model M7-1315C especially for cube, together with fan (medium 
silent, I would say) and Torx, a good coloured installation guide on 
paper, two CDs and it runs stable with 1.4 GHz in my cube.

It is really fast, faster than the 1.35 GHz Powerlogix-Upgrade that 
never ran stable in my cube, as noted.

Cause this upgrade runs out now, as my distributer told me, I can 
recommend it to everyone, really.
My first impression is very good. I bought it over here in germany 
for 420 Euro. Buy it now or never.

Regards
Stefan


&gt;<i>Stefan: If you have not done the reversing procedure (remove the 
</I>&gt;<i>PowerLogix patch), your Cube is not going to boot in MacOS 9.2.x 
</I>&gt;<i>without the PL 1.3GHz CPU. I had to remove the patch when I sent 
</I>&gt;<i>back mine that was FireWire faulty but unfortunately didn't keep a 
</I>&gt;<i>PL CD copy/image. I'd suggest you to email PowerLogix directly and 
</I>&gt;<i>explain the problem you're having and I'm almost sure they will help 
</I>&gt;<i>you out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Good luck,
</I>&gt;<i>LM
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
</PRE>
