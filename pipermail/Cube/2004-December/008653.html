<PRE>Hello Luis, hello Stuart,

thanks for answering.

To Stuart first: Together with the upgrade I built in a Panaflo-fan, 
that works great (that means: much better than the processor :-)). A 
little noisy, but effective.
The power consumption should also be no question, because especially 
this 7457 has a very low wish of power (Powerlogix tell's us...)

To Luis:
That sounds like the story of twins. Just the same problems: My 
FW-HDs were all corrupted and because I was too optimistic (will 
never be again, I swear!) I first lost all of my data. On the most 
important disk I could save them, but a second large disk is 
physically or electrically dead.
Is there any explanation for this phenomenon?
Did Powerlogix in your case accept the problem and did you get back your money?

Could/would you be so kind as to take a look onto your cube's 
firmware-Version (boot ROM)?
When trying to install/update it with 4.1.9 ROM Update you will get 
the information.
By the time: I didn't get this information with System Profiler 
either with OS 9 nor with OS-X.

Looking forward: What do you/what do you all think about the new 
Sonnet-upgrade with 1.7 GHz???
I didn't read anything about (1) cache (2) processor-type or (3) 
power-consumption.

Thanks for new answers
Stefan



&gt;<i>Stefan: Yes. The 'outlines' are indeed too closer. Mine was a PL 
</I>&gt;<i>1,35GHz. Here's the horror story:
</I>&gt;<i>(already published @ the list, so apologies to those of who've read 
</I>&gt;<i>it again and again)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>First of all, I've backed up my entire internal HD drive first, 
</I>&gt;<i>followed the manuals and VideoCD provided by PowerLogix, pressed 
</I>&gt;<i>CUDA button once, started up the Mac and both Mac OS 9 (firmware 
</I>&gt;<i>patch needed) and Mac OS X worked fine. Testing the hardware I faced 
</I>&gt;<i>the terrible issue that would lead me to corrupt my internal Seagate 
</I>&gt;<i>80GB HD, my external FW 160GB HD and my internal iBook 20GB HD. EACH 
</I>&gt;<i>and ANY FireWire copy was corrupting my hard disks. I must underline 
</I>&gt;<i>that this took place ONLY when in Mac OS X. Everything worked 
</I>&gt;<i>FLAWLESSLY when in Mac OS 9 (including several FW copies, go 
</I>&gt;<i>figure!). YES, I've tested it with several independant FW disks and 
</I>&gt;<i>cables.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Procedures (after persistent negative results)...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1. Had to run DiskWarrior on each and every hard disk in order to 
</I>&gt;<i>repair my precious and lifetime data.
</I>&gt;<i>2. Had to format/repartition/reinstall Mac OS 9 and X in my internal 
</I>&gt;<i>Seagate 80 GB.
</I>&gt;<i>3. Fresh(es) OSs now. Still no difference. FW copy crashing in Mac 
</I>&gt;<i>OS X Finder, Spinning beach ball of death, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>4. Removed my internal Seagate 80GB and swapped it for a Western 
</I>&gt;<i>Digital 120GB. Reistalled. No go. FW not working.
</I>&gt;<i>5. Downclocked Seagate 80GB to ATA66. Reinstalled. No way Jose.
</I>&gt;<i>6. Removed firmware patches. Put back original CPU (stock 450MHz). 
</I>&gt;<i>No FireWire issues when in Mac OS 9 or X. Cube works like a genuine 
</I>&gt;<i>swiss quartz swatch now.
</I>&gt;<i>7. I might consider a GigaDesigns or Sonnet next time. Not sure 
</I>&gt;<i>yet... honestly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>LM
</I></PRE>
