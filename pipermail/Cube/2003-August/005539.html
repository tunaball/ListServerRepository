     IMHO, the best way to learn HTML (as opposed to a specific piece 
of Website building software that will always manage to fall short in 
some way, so you'll have to learn another) is the &quot;View Source&quot; 
capability in any Web browser and a text editor (SimpleText if you're 
still using OS 9, TextEdit if you use OS X;; BBedit [commercial] in 
either case --- it does a beautiful job of color-coding HTML tags).

     Find a Web page whose looks you like, get the source, and start 
playing around with it --- it's the time-honored way of learning Web 
design. Yes, Javascrpt and the like may not be worth learning, but 
they may also not be worth putting in your Website.

     A hint as to why &quot;IMHO&quot; is probably valid: if HTML weren't sop 
easy to learn this way, it wouldn't have caught on so fast. There 
were millions of Websites long before there were Web design tools.

      Caveat: you shouldn't use copyrighted material you got in this 
way on your Website --- but you knew that already.

     FWIW,
