Not a problem - perfectly normal behaviour at this stage.  Since the 
system can't find an OS to boot from (nothing on the new drive and 
firewire drive not plugged in).

&gt;<i> After booting from the firewire drive, everything runs perfectly, but 
</I>&gt;<i> when I try and clone the firewire drive to my 120GB hard drive, it

Just like in OS 9 it has to show up on the Desktop in order to be a 
target for this kind of activity, just like the 20 Gb firewire did 
originally.  Right now the hardware can see it (which is good) but 
since it doesn't have the partitioning and formatting done, the OS 
doesn't know about it yet.

&gt;<i> I've looked in the Disk utility section and it recognizes it and says 
</I>&gt;<i> it is set to master .
</I>
That's very good.  Now in order for it to be usable by the OS, you'll 
also want to see the partitions below the generic disc icon in that 
window.

&gt;<i> I remember a faff with the jumper settings so I have tried it with the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'CS setting it came with.  'Slave' and 'Master'.  At the moment it is 
</I>&gt;<i> set in the top row between pins 2 and 3 from the left.   (Upper slave 
</I>&gt;<i> and upper master, I think) as that is what the drive I took out had 
</I>&gt;<i> the jumper set to.
</I>
For a cube internal, master is perfect.  You're on the right track!

&gt;<i> Can anyone please help or think of a way of getting the beast to 
</I>&gt;<i> recognize the new drive properly?
</I>
Next step is the partitioning and formatting step.  In the Disk Utility 
application, select the Partition tab, and set up the partitions the 
way you have decided.  The easiest (I think) is to select the number of 
partitions you want from the volume scheme and then on the second and 
third partitions just highlight them on the left, type in the Gb size 
you want and the primary will auto-resize to take up the remaining 
space.  You don't need to worry about renaming them now since you'll be 
able to do so afterwards (but you can if you want).

&gt;<i> I'm off for a shower to mop my fevered brow.  Back in 30 mins
</I>
Doing well so far. Nothing lost or damaged so all is well.  No worries 
(deep breath!).
