Ah..! The *real* problem is starting to dawn on me now... ;-)

You're right, this is really the last resort... When you are sure there is
no other way of getting back your data, you can always try this.

&gt;<i> Just so you have an idea of scale of files etc here messages 625.5 MB Database
</I>&gt;<i> 2.6 MB
</I>
That's Entourage 2001, right? Not Entourage X? Entourage X has no &quot;Messages&quot;
file, just &quot;Database&quot;.

Anyway, the principle is the same. You want to make Entourage recognise your
'real' identity.

Make sure your Identity folder is in the right place. That's
Documents/Microsoft User Data/Entourage Identities (from memory, I don't use
Entourage 2001 any longer).

There should be a folder there called &quot;Main Identity&quot;, or something else if
you renamed your Entourage identity to something else.

Take your 'old' identity folder, rename it to 'John Guy', and place it in
the same folder as the 'Main Identity' folder. Then, start Entourage. It'll
start with the 'Main Identity' active. Under the File menu, there is an
option to switch identities. If all is reasonably well, you should be able
to choose the 'John Guy' identity from there. If there are problems,
choosing an identity with Option held down works like starting Entourage
with Option depressed, and will offer the choice of standard and advanced
rebuild of your data files.

Excellent Entourage help is found on Microsoft's news server,
news.microsoft.com, in the group microsoft.public.mac.office.entourage.
