John,

Sorry, but I cannot help you with the Entourage problem, and in fact looking
for some info from you regarding your upgrade to the 1.2 GHz card.

I just installed the upgrade myself, but it was a disaster.  The card itself
began to smoke immediately after turning on the machine.  It was clearly
coming from a component on the card.  I took the Cube apart and made sure
all items were seated properly, and turned on the Cube again.  Once more
there was smoke from the card.

I was lucky enough that the reinstallation of the the original card was all
I needed to do to get the Cube back up and running.

I am out of Australia, and it is difficult to get any info right now since
it is the weekend.  What I want to ask is this:  The new card has absolutely
no contact with the internal heat sink.  The old card had a very heavy piece
of metal connected to it, and that metal was in contact with the heat sink.
Is this how your card was constructed?  It seems amazing to me that just the
fan is meant to dissipate the heat from the card.

Also there was a tube of material which was meant to be dabbed on to the top
of the processor.  This was covered in the written instruction, but no
mention of that in the video instructions.  Did you apply this material?

It was also surprising to me that the video instruction made no mention of
the dip switches which must be set.  Fortunately the switches seemed to be
set for 1.2 already.

Anyway I am glad that your computer has started up okay (and hopefully you
can get around your Entourage problem).

It would be great if you could impart your experience to me.


Thanks,


Russ
