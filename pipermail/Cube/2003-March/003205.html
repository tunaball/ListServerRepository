<PRE>OK - newly arrived in France, this has been a problem dogging me as 
well.  There's a number of other items that I would love to pick up 
that I know are available quite cheap State-side... can anyone explain 
to me why USB hubs are ridiculously overpriced here?  What with the 
Euro being worth more than the USD these days the prices should be 
inverted.

Fully realizing the tax implications with the VAT in the UK and the 
french equivalent there still shouldn't be the kind of price disparity 
we're all seeing here.

How does the idea of setting up a European Cube-COOP for importing 
various bits and pieces of stuff sound to everyone? I have a number of 
friends left back in the US that would be able to handle the receipt 
and transhipment of stuff for us.  Especially if we can get registered 
as a distributor so we can get close to retail costs.

Anyone interested? Heck I'm unemployed right now and could set 
something up pretty easily. More thoughts on this - how about I set up 
a site where we can request items and when we reach a critical mass on 
a given product I'll take care of ordering and shipping and stuff.

Delaware incorporation will cost me about $400. If I'm up front about 
all of the costs that I incur in collecting and distributing stuff 
would that make people happy?  I'd probably need to use something like 
PayPal to get started since that's a nightmare getting an internet 
merchant account if you don't come to the able with lots of money and 
history.

Hmmm.
