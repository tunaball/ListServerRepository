<PRE>Important READ the entire mail various points addressed!
Relates to ANYONE thinking of getting this upgrade in UK/Europe


&gt;<i> Whilst I AGREE that some UK retailers are marking up their US-sourced
</I>&gt;<i> products a little too much, doing a straight dollar-pound/euro conversion
</I>&gt;<i> isn't exactly fair on them either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any retailer that sells a US-sourced product has to import them into their
</I>&gt;<i> country to sell, and as such are subject to import duties - in much the same
</I>&gt;<i> way UPS or FedEx pass them onto us when we buy from the US - plus the
</I>&gt;<i> shipping costs etc. Obviously they can't get a &quot;mate&quot; to ship them 100 units
</I>&gt;<i> privately as &quot;gifts&quot;.
</I>
Bull!
There is no import duty to pay on the Powerlogix cards, the import duty 10
digit code is zero rated. (check with the HMCE import office!)
You only pay vat on the shipping, handling and insurance.
Get your facts straight first.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Import duties vary according the classification of the product and (I
</I>&gt;<i> believe) you have to have a license to do it, so it's quite easy to see how
</I>&gt;<i> a $100 product can turn into a &#163;200 product when you're only dealing with a
</I>&gt;<i> few hundred units. It's also worth stating that a privately shipped &quot;gift&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> comes with no warranty either.
</I>

No licence required if you are a private individual or the volume is
determined to be below the level that constitutes commercial distribution.
Again check your facts...

&gt;<i> All that said, I'm still disappointed that the larger dealers - Cancom,
</I>&gt;<i> MacWarehouse et al are not passing volume discounts to us, as they must be
</I>&gt;<i> importing a great deal of products and the costs of importing can be
</I>&gt;<i> amortised over this great number of products as opposed to one specific
</I>&gt;<i> product type that a smaller specialist dealer may choose to import.
</I>The volume discounts are not there to be had, Powerlogix has only created a
retail pricing structure, the distributor pricing structure is +- 10% the
same.

The cheapest UK price (1ghz) is &#163;559 ex vat and delivery, comes to a sum
total &#163;670.93 inc vat + delivery

Do the math, it is cheaper to buy, personal import, pay the vat on the
shipping etc and should you have any problems ship back to the USA and you
are still quids in...
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just my 2cents. I'm watching the 1.2 prices like a hawk myself and will
</I>&gt;<i> pounce when either my resolve gives up, or they drop below &#163;500 from a UK
</I>&gt;<i> supplier
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tom
</I>They wont be under &#163;500 for a long time, see above...

PS I hope you are listening RJ, we are not buying your product over here
'cos:

1 we are getting screwed on price it is a straight dollar/pound conversion

2 There is no product over here (AM micro don&#185;t have any and channel
dynamics are awaiting delivery...)

3 the support we get is limited to HAVING TO PAY THROUGH THE NOSE for a
dealer service that would cost us the equivalent of $1077 Gross for a 1 Ghz
upgrade when the retail US cost including shipping etc is ONLY $535


Why are we EXPECTED to shoulder these prices when our American brethren get
the same product HALF PRICE effectively?


Please explain in detail, enquiring minds are highly curious!!!
