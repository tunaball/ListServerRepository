<PRE>At the risk of annoying all of you who have AOL accounts:

So how many more years are yo going to keep that AOL account before 
realizing that you could have a better deal with Earthlink that's won't 
force you to use their email client?

OS X's Mail won't even let you import mail files from AOL's client. 
Please seriously consider giving up AOL. It is a fundamentally bad 
deal. You just found out why you never should have had an AOL account 
in the first place.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Did a partial reinstall of  9.1 OS . This made MS word stop

</I>&gt;<i> 2. Increased memory of MS word ; this speeded up save feature for MS 
</I>&gt;<i> word
</I>&gt;<i> that was unreasonably slow, and spell check that would bomb in the 
</I>&gt;<i> midst of
</I>&gt;<i> document checking. Dont ask me why.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Spent over an hour with an AOL phone tech. at midnight last night.
</I>&gt;<i> Finanlly figured out that the 48MB file of sent and rec'd emails over 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> last several years was corrupt. Moving it out of aol folder and onto 
</I>&gt;<i> desktop
</I>&gt;<i> solved the problem. The file is called &quot;filing cabinet.&quot; It was causing
</I>&gt;<i> everything to go haywire. Dont ask me why.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone has any brilliant ideas about how to extract the info from a 
</I>&gt;<i> 48MB
</I>&gt;<i> 'aol filinng cabinet' file please let me know. It absolutely will not 
</I>&gt;<i> open in
</I>&gt;<i> aol, and it of course is in aol &quot;email sent&quot; and &quot;email rec'd&quot; format. 
</I>&gt;<i> I did
</I>&gt;<i> open a tiny file cab (also corrupted) attached to another filing 
</I>&gt;<i> cabinet on
</I>&gt;<i> same account by doing &quot;insert file&quot; into MS Word. Alot of junk, but the
</I>&gt;<i> messages in between the junk are readable. The prob with the 48 MB 
</I>&gt;<i> file is I
</I>&gt;<i> think is too big to insert into a MS doc. Any ideas?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> again, thank you very much for helping, Your suggestions helped me 
</I>&gt;<i> find the
</I>&gt;<i> way to fix things.
