nvidia geforce 2MX (although you probably won't find the version that  
went into the cube - that one had a large heatsink). However, the  
&quot;regular&quot; one should do just fine because a lot of people have been  
running it for years with no problem. There are a few overheating  
reports but generally you should be fine. Don't know how hard they  
are to find nowadays but check on ebay. Also note that some are  
selling flashed PC cards (those don't have ADC connectors).
The other option is ATI Radeon 7500. You might get it from someone  
who upgraded the graphic card in the desktop mac. Radeon 7500 also  
doesn't have a fan, and runs faster and cooler than 2MX. I'm running  
one with zero problems, the downside is that the connector side of  
the card does not perfectly fit in the opening on the bottom of the  
cube so you will have to remove the metal plate from the card. The  
plus side of this is that improves cooling, however the card is a bit  
'loose' because it is held in place only by the AGP connector and the  
single screw inside. I don't see this as a problem because it is not  
like the Cube is moving around a lot.
