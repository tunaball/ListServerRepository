</I>&gt;&gt;<i> music, the medium is irrelevant; as long as the music is coming from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speakers, who cares what the medium is?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But there are advantages to CDs as well. Some people enjoy having the liner

</I>&gt;<i> (not everyone has an MP3 player) and a very common standard (almost
</I>&gt;<i> everyone, even if they don't have a PC, can play CDs; a computer or other
</I>&gt;<i> MP3 player is harder to find and a AAC player even harder). No compressed
</I>&gt;<i> format will ever truly have CD quality either, so hardcore audiophiles will
</I>&gt;<i> probably continue to buy CDs until the technology catches up to their
</I>&gt;<i> expectations. My point in all this is that the medium still makes a huge
</I>&gt;<i> difference in how you listen to music.
</I>
Again, I didn't (and don't argue that point. I like having actual CD's, too.

All I was objecting to was the &quot;it didn't work for books, therefore it will
not work for CD's&quot; statement.

However, seeing as there are huge numbers of people trading electronic
copies of CD's already, whereas with books, this is a much smaller problem,
I would be inclined to think that when it comes down to it, people find the
medium of bigger importance in the case of books than in the case of music.
