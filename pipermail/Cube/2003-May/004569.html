Thanks John Guy. I am happy that there is forum to share our experiences 
with various companies. From the abysmal PL to the excellent Sonnet.

&gt;&gt;<i>Jeff, thanks for the reply.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>IMHO, they can hire all the PR firms they want. After what they put me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>through, I'd *NEVER* deal with them again, I don't care what amazing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>products thay have in the pipeline. What I paid for I didn't get, a dual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>800 G4 and all we're getting is &quot;developement is under way and we'll
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have it shipping in 4-6 weeks&quot;. Sad part is, many on this list and other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Cube forums actually believe this horsehockey and eat up everything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Robert feeds them. They will _never_ produce a dualie for the Cube, I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>sure of it. They're just so full of it, it wreaks all the way to Canada.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>My Cube was gone for 4 months. They plunked a 450 MHz processor in it to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>send it back. They also sent it with a 16 MB ATI card and I had bought a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Radeon which had fried during the upgrade.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>They could have had the decency to install a faster processor and if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>they had any heart at all, they would have offered a processor for free
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>or at least with a hefty discount for all my trouble. I mentionned this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to Robert and was refused. They could have also sent me a video card a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>heck of a lot faster than what they did (Robert sent me one recently,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>after 7 (!) months of  my originally purchasing the upgrade). I sent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>them a list of vendors and they never moved a finger. &quot;You'll be _soon_
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>getting a video card, equivalent or faster than the Radeon&quot;. God they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>are so full of it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>To add insult to injury, they lied to me (intentionally or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>unintentionally) by telling me that the clear case of my Cube broke
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>during transport. They had me scrambling to try to find another one and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>when they returned it to me, my Cube had the same case that it did when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I sent it in (I know, I had carved my initials on the bottom of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>case). This was a great distraction strategy from their part, they were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>probably buying for time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I have had to threaten them with legal action *every* step of the way in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>order to get what was destroyed during the upgrade. Plus, I have had to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>put up with Robert's snide remarks and sarcasm which was apparent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>through his emails.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>In conclusion, a word to the wise: Buyer BEWARE.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>As for Waypoint, I dealt with John Highhouse, a wonderful fellow, that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>managed to get me a rebate from OWC. But Owen was a tremendous pain in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the rear. I would recommend Waypoint but don't deal with Owen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>So in order to tally up my losses during this fiasco:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>1. Computer gone for 4 months.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>2. Duty on the dual 800 for which I'll probably never be refunded  (200 US).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>3. Interest I paid on my credit card without having the product in hand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(20 US in the course of the 4 months).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>4. Got a computer back with an inferior Video card and processor.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>5. Aggravation for having to beg for what was mine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>6. Dealing with the arrogance of Robert J.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>7. My Cube was hastily put together with many screws missing inside.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>What they should have done to keep me happy:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Sent me a tower temporarily, because they were aware that the Cube was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>my main computer at home. When they did send me back my Cube, they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>should have offered me a discount or even offer an upgrade for free. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>mean, common, how many people had their Cubes fried? 5? 10? This would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have saved them a lot of bad PR and would have prevented me and others
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>from being bitter and posting to appropriate boards. Not lie to their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>customers, like they did with me about the broken clear case in order to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>buy time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>When they did finally send me back my Cube, they should have put in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>faster CPU than the OEM 500 MHz. Instead, I got a slower one. They
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>should have sent me a faster video card, equivalent to my Radeon a long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>time ago instead of making me beg and threaten them before they actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>got off their laurels and did something about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>In conclusion, a dual CPU for the Cube will never materialize. It's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>vaporware, no matter what Robert says. Powerlogix is rotten to the core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and hiring the best PR companies will not change this fact. They lie,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>cheat and don't give a damn about their customers. They're simply in it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>for the money.
