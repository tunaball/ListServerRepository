<PRE>Is Isn't there some kind of list for audio/MP3 that would be BETTER 
for all of these iTunes postings?  It seems to be getting out of 
hand, and although I appreciate the initial info, iTunes is not 
Cube-centric, therefore I suggest these discussions continue offline 
or wherever more appropriate.

As for Cube-centric issues, I have been successfully running a 
GeForce 3, MODIFIED, off my Cube 450 and a 22&quot; Cinema Screen, for 
over a month now with NO PROBLEMS and NO FAN. I have removed the fan 
from the 64MB GeForce and installed MOST of a current heatsink setup 
available retail online and at many stores (Frys, CompUSA). I have 
also changed one of the heatsinks attached to a bank of memomy chips 
on the GeForce board itself (so that the fins all go in a vertical 
direction when installed), and  CUT OUT the little perforated plastic 
section on the case that blocks a GREAT deal of airflow from the 
video card, leaving the entire vent above it free. The video card, 
with digital temp tests off a thermometer, is now regularly lower 
than when it had the stock 16MB card installed; Themodock NEVER goes 
above 40c, and I put it to sleep whenever not in use to keep the heat 
down (Themodock regularly reads 20 or below when it first wakes up). 
No sleep issues, and with the VERY quiet 120gb Barracuda V it is 
faster at number crunching, much faster at screen redraws, and very 
silent. The improvements are noticeable in OS 9 &amp; 10 (1.5gb RAM, BTW).

I also run NO partitions, and switch between 9, 10 and classic 
regularly. BTW, unless you plan on using your internal drive MOSTLY 
for LARGE files (video, large image files, etc.) the 2MB cache 
version of the Barracuda will be faster and a bit cooler (less memory 
to heat up).  I am in line for a dual 1.25 PowerLogix upgrade when 
they are REALLY ready, and hope the fan, if required (they are trying 
the new, cooler chips) will not bug me too much. I also hear they 
have an alternate, slightly larger Cube case in mind for us NOFAN 
fans...

I promise (I know I said this before), the NEXT time I open it up for 
any reason, I will take and post photos of the video card mods),
