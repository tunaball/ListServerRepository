<PRE>Yo Jesse,
Your pictures are so compelling, I had to have it NOW. Went to Best Buy 
in South San Jose CA today, Sunday, and did the same thing you did only 
with the 30 GB model for only $100 more. They were still hiding them in 
a secret locked cabinet. Someone told the manager that they weren't 
allowed to sell them until ... and then he forgot when to bring them 
&quot;out&quot; if you can call locked in a glass case &quot;out&quot;. But he decided to 
sell one to me. What a work of art! I am still dumbfounded at how this 
series iPod could be bigger inside and smaller outside. I imagine the 
package is going to get a Cleo award for product packaging. And there's 
no doubt this ipod design will win every award it is entered in.

It's brilliant marketing to make the iPod compatible with both Mac and 
Windows in the same box. Makes it much easier for Apple to meet market 
demand with as many of just three boxes as they can make and spread 
around. Plus resellers who normally only sell Windows accessories are 
forced to sell this Mac accessory as well. Seems like the iPod is a 
sort of Trojan Horse for Apple to get a serious toehold into the 
Windows market. Has to cause some Windows users to consider switching 
to Mac next time they feel like a new computer.

I also checked with CompUSA. Both stores had zero new 10GB models. 
Seems to me that the 15 and 30 GB models are a much better buy if you 
care about the Dock, Case and Remote. Al-a-cart they cost another $120 
($40 each) that the 15 GB model includes for $20 less.

I could have more easily gone to the Apple Store in Santa Clara, but 
they don't offer any kind of replacement warranty at all &#8212; just a 
T-Shirt and a poster.

This Best Buy still has one old 20 for $449 and one old 10 for $269 
both open box. Can't see how they'll ever sell at those prices. this 
third generation model has way too many advantages over the second 
generation model.

Thanks again jesse.
