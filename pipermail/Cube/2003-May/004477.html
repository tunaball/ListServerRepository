<PRE>Your reader is now your bottleneck. Watch OfficeMax ads. Right now you 
can get a 52x24x52x CD-RW drive there for $9.95 after $40 rebate. 
Remove your old 24x reader and put the new one in your FW case and try 
that for ripping. You should get 19X rips at least. I would love to 
know what your rip speed is after you do this. I hope you do. It's $14 
including 8% sales tax here in California.

</I>&gt;<i> for 9.99 and it took no time to DL. Not only did I say $$$ but also 
</I>&gt;<i> the time to rip it, which equals $$$.
