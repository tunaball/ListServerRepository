<PRE>WD SE 120 drives are $70-$80 after the May $80 rebate all over the 
place but NOT OWC. Tell her to go all the way. She will never regret 
putting as big a drive as possible before adding 250 GB FW externals 
later. Waste of money only buying an 80 ($30 rebate this month) with 
120 ($80 rebate this month) is as high as she can go. Especially with 
the Eye TV eating GBs of space in nothing flat. She'll need the other 
40 (35 net) for all her captured TV shows. Tell her to pay attention to 
the Sunday morning inserts for the deal of the week.
