I didnt even think of trying to administer the AE's with the Airport 
Admin Utility - thanks! I only tried bouncing it from 1 to 6. Also tried 
the &quot;enable signal robustness&quot;. It does seem to have stopped the 
dropouts on the one unit that's isolated. The other one still had some 
issues. What does seem to have helped is changing which one was 
connected to the wired network (previously the bedroom, now the living 
room). The device is not dropping out at all now, which contradicts what 
I assumed was going on - that the whole stream was over wifi and not 
wired. Looks like more troubleshooting ahead.
