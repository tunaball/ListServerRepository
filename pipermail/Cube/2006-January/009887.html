<PRE>It is with some hesitation that I list my Cube as being for sale. I  
simply don't need another computer and I'd really like to see it go  
to someone that will enjoy it. I'm posting it here before I take it  
the the swaplist or eBay. I'm travelling all the time for work, and  
use my Powerbook for almost everything. I also have a G4 tower that I  
use in my office, so the Cube has become a hobby, rather than a  
useful tool for me.

It's upgraded in about every way possible, so you shouldn't have to  
do much more to it.

Specs are:
Power Mac G4 Cube (originally a 500mHz model)
1.2 gHz Powerlogix G4 upgrade (7455-based, 2MB L3 cache, no patches  
needed)
1GB RAM (2 modules, 1 RAM slot free)
120GB Western Digital Caviar SE hard drive (7200 rpm, 8MB cache, very  
fast)
Slot-loading superdrive DVD-RW/CDRW (OWC superdrive, I replaced the  
original DVD-ROM 6 months ago, works great in iApps, no patch needed)
Apple OEM Radeon 7500 installed (32MB VRAM, dual display support,no  
fan, has VGA and ADC ports)
Low speed base fan installed, almost silent operation
Apple Pro USB keyboard and mouse (white)
Apple G4 Cube speakers
Apple G4 Cube power supply

Firewire, USB, ethernet ports all work great. I've never used the  
modem, but I assume it works as well.

It has been running great with the CPU upgrade for about 2 years. No  
problems at all, no crashes, etc. It does suffer from the Powerlogix  
sleep problem (will not wake properly from system sleep). This is a  
fairly common problem, and I just let the display and hard drive  
sleep, rather than the system.

I do not have the original box, manuals or CDs for this Cube. I am  
including the following extras: Custom made Cube stand (aluminum,  
supports the Cube about 1 inch above the desk for additional  
airflow), Custom carrying case from Willow Design (they made a custom  
case that holds the Cube, power supply, speakers, keyboard, etc.). I  
will also include the original box and CD from the Powerlogix upgrade  
and the original 500mHz CPU.

It will have a clean install of MacOS 10.4 Tiger on the hard drive,  
other than that the drive will be wiped clean. No CDs or other  
software as included.

Asking $850 shipping from Salt Lake City (84108) to wherever you are.  
It will be very well packed.

If the buyer wishes, for an extra $50, I'll upgrade the video card to  
a Radeon 9200 (128MB VRAM, VGA an DVI ports). It's a flashed PC card,  
but it's been working great for months. It has a low speed, very  
quiet fan on the card. I'm actually running both this fan and he base  
fan at a reduced voltage, so it's almost completely silent.

</PRE>
