<PRE>Ditto... I have half a gig in my Cube, but only 256MB in my Xserve... I 
thought this would be a problem, and that I'd want more RAM in the 
Xserve, but the Xserve is faster than the Cube in every way... Sure, 
I'll max em' both out eventually, but both of my laptops [G3 500 iBook, 
G4 400 TiBook] both do fine with 256/384 respectively... I keep several 
apps open simultaneously on each, and have not had a memory alert since 
I had 128 in the iBook...

</I>&gt;<i> More memory won't help at all unless you are using up what you have.
</I>&gt;<i> It will not speed up anything if you can already fit (and run) all your
</I>&gt;<i> current applications without having to use swap space.  What is swap
</I>&gt;<i> space?  That's disk drive space that is used to extend your memory when
</I>&gt;<i> your physical memory is full.  It is very slow compared to RAM.  When
</I>&gt;<i> your system needs more memory for the currently running process it
</I>&gt;<i> 'swaps out' some pieces of your idle processes to that reserved disk
</I>&gt;<i> space.  When you want to use one of those idle processes again the
</I>&gt;<i> system must bring that program (and any data it is manipulating) back 
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> from the disk.  This is a very slow operation when compared to 
</I>&gt;<i> switching
</I>&gt;<i> applications when the both fit in existing physical RAM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you know if you're swapping?  Well, being an old Unix guy 
</I>&gt;<i> myself,
</I>&gt;<i> I'd launch &quot;/usr/bin/vm_stat 2&quot; in the terminal app (that '2' means
</I>&gt;<i> refresh every 2 seconds), but I know most of you old time Mac-heads
</I>&gt;<i> cringe at the mere mention of the command line, so I would point you to
</I>&gt;<i> /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.  Click on the 'System Memory'
</I>&gt;<i> tab towards the bottom of the window and then launch every application
</I>&gt;<i> you want to use, all at the same time.  Then watch the pretty picture 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> see your free memory disappear.  An interesting statistic to watch is
</I>&gt;<i> the Page ins/outs.  The page-ins are going to be high because I believe
</I>&gt;<i> they count normal disk reads that happen when you launch any program,
</I>&gt;<i> which is combined with the number of page-ins from swap.  But the
</I>&gt;<i> page-outs shouldn't be very high.  My system has been up for 2.5 days
</I>&gt;<i> and my page-outs number is only ~4500.  I've got 1.5Gigs of RAM and I
</I>&gt;<i> just launched every app on my dock and I never paged out once, so more
</I>&gt;<i> memory added to my system wouldn't speed anything up for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if you are swapping (paging in and out) then you will benefit
</I>&gt;<i> GREATLY from additional RAM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, this activity is thanks to the virtual memory management
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities of Unix.
