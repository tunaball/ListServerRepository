<PRE>Even though I am forced to sell my Cubes (see my last posting) 
because of some of the latest software and hardware requirements 
(1000 mHz bus anyone?), I would have perhaps waited another 6 months, 
and have enjoyed over a year of much faster performance, if Robert 
Jagitsch at PowerLogix was a more honest and ethical person. In 
January of 2003 he emailed this list requesting to purchase a few 
Cubes for their R&amp;D department, and it is wonderful that their 
company has continued to develop Cube upgrade products. I had an 
extra system, and in discussions agreed to give PowerLogix my spare 
(stock configuration) Cube system IN EXCHANGE for, upon release, a 
promised dual-CPU upgrade card. Although it was understood that it 
could be a few months before the cards were ready, I was assured 
that, with new cooler chips coming out, that it was going to happen. 
Cut to this January, after dozens of phone messages and emails (from 
me, without replys) asking how much longer I was expected to wait for 
the promised barter deal to be completed. I think we actually spoke 
two times during 2003, and I have received only one email message 
from him in 2004 after requesting (at least) a 1.2 single card and 
new clear case for use until the dual was completed:

Joel,

We'll have a card going out to you in the next couple of days.

Well, true-to-form, we are getting the end of March 2004, and I have 
received nothing (not even follow-up emails or a phone call to 
explain the further delay). I know he watches this list religiously, 
so perhaps I will get some results from this posting. Would ANY other 
Cube lister who was involved in this deal (either sold outright or 
lent for a card) please post their experiences with the company ON 
THIS LIST (for a public record). At this point, if more people are 
experiencing the same problems, a possible legal case may be my only 
recourse. It's a shame, with some great Cube products, and the 
wonderful reviews of the latest G4 1.2 cards, that PowerLogix (or at 
least one of its partner/owners) has been so disingenuous and 
uncommunicative. Let's see, rental on a Cube system for 14 months at, 
say, a reasonable $150/week, plus return of the system, comes to...
