<PRE>This topic is too irresistible to not chime in. I think Steve-o must 
have had me in mind for his target market as I'm using my Cube or 
something else of his every hour I'm awake! I used to have an 
office/studio away from my flat and used Mentho's old iPod to move 
music back and forth. Now I'm all under one roof, in an old Greyhound 
bus of all things, so I'm lounging in excess. I have my Cube running my 
business and playing music all day. It's my fax machine, iLife centre, 
heck, even the closest thing to a secretary! I have it run through a 
fantastic sound system and have the system also run back through the 
cube so I can record old records, tapes, video, etc to the cube. I have 
Speech read my e-mail over that system and it sounds just like another 
person's onboard&#8230; with a bad lisp. The 20&quot; panel is great for movies as 
well as work.

I also have a 15&quot; flat iMac as a TV / VCR by the bed. Files can pass 
from one to the other over Airport and I'm almost ready to jump on 
Apple's wireless keyboard as a sort of super-pumped-up remote for the 
iMac. It's also hooked into the sound system for that big home-theater 
experience. If I had a little patience, I would have waited for the 20&quot; 
iMac and been enjoying a little bigger &quot;TV&quot; in the bedroom. (Aw, I've 
got a small place&#8230; 15&quot; is fine.) Regarding technology, this is an 
exciting time to be alive. I'll wrap up with a simple plug for anyone 
getting ready to go the entertainment centre route: these are the 
speaks I'm using and I'm in love!
