<PRE>Are you suggesting I don't know what I'm talking about or that the
recipient of my advice is to stupid to own a computer?  Either way,
you're wrong.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; filling in your full name in the Name:  box.  If this does not EXACTLY

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; found that I had an extra space between my first and last names on one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; of my machines and every attempt to login always failed on the first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; attempt until I replaced the full name with my 'short' name.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I will try playing with the name to see if that is the problem.  So, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I understand this my password is my admin login password (for the whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; machine).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is no distinction between your normal password and your 'admin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; login password'.  You are either classified as an administrator,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allowed to do administrative tasks with your normal login (but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; required to re-certify your identity by providing *your* password when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requesting the system to perform an administrative task), or you're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not.  There is no seperate admin password.  And you have the option to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grant admin privileges to any additional accounts you create on your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine (for your boy friend, mother, roommate, whatever) or not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is a real admin account (referred to as the root account), but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is typically disabled by default by Apple.  It can be enabled if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; desired, but rarely if ever required.  And definitely not required to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perform such tasks as remotely accessing Shares.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As an experiment I just tried remotely mounting my Cube's filesystems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; onto my Powerbook using my housekeeper's non-administrative-enabled
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; account (I happen to know her password since she hasn't changed it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the one I gave her initially when I created her account).  She
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only has an account on the Cube, not on the powerbook.  'She' was only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; offered the opportunity to mount her own files or my dropbox (a place
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to put files you want to share).  No opportunity to mount the complete
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system disk was offered to 'her'.  You should be able to deduce from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this description that I'm 'pretending' to be her.  As far as the Cube
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is concerned, since I know her password, I am her.  As far as the PB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is concerned *I'm* asking for this remote filesystem to be mounted.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as the Cube is concerned *she* is doing the asking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Confusing, isn't it.  I'm doing my best to try and clarify things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here, but I fear I may be mudding up the waters.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If I am at the computer named GIMLEY with login password of DWARF
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and my server upstairs is CURIOUS GEORGE with login password of BIG
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; YELLOW HAT
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why would you use two different password for yourself to access your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own machines?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I can get access to Curious George from Gimley with the password DWARF
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - is that correct?  Or do I need to use the pass BIG YELLOW HAT?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In your case, no, you'd have to use BIG YELLOW HAT.  But more important
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than that, what are you using as the login name (in the Name: box)?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are your login names the same on both boxes?  If so (and that's logical)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why wouldn't you use the same password?  The machine doesn't have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; password, your account does.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Is there a place on the server computer that allows me to specify a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; password for networking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ie. Computer - Gimley - pasword - SHORTY to access this computer via
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; network. (instead of DWARF)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The password is tied directly to the account on the the local box.  In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your senerio, there is no 'networking' password (I'm qualifying that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comment because in senerios where all machines rely on a centrally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; managed Netinfo server, there is such a concept as a 'network'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; password, but it's still tied to the user's account, not the machine).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's something askew in your view of things here and I can't quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; put my finger on it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Point being, you want to fill in that Name: field with the login
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; name of the account on the remote machine.  Either the full name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; or the 'short' name.  Then enter the password you use on that remote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; machine to login as if you where sitting down in front of it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Next you will see a dialog box offering you the opportunity to mount
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; up on your local machine one of the available filesystems on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; remote machine.  This can be an iPod, an iDisk, your home directory,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; or even the remote machine's entire hard disk (you probably will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; required to have an administrator's account on the remote machine to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; mount up the whole disk (I would think, but I'm not sure because I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; *am* the administrator on all my machines).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In OS 9 you could specify what disks or folders would be shared with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; whom via the GET INFO on each file/folder/disk.  Is there any such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; control in OS X or is it only Guest access or ALL access via proper
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; pass login?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's close to that, but not exactly.  Accounts that have been granted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; administrative privileges get access to what you refer to as ALL, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regular accounts only get access to their own home directory and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dropboxs of all other accounts.  Guests only get access to the Dropboxes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But, this access to ALL for administrative enabled accounts is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entirely unrestricted.  I can mount up my remote machine's entire hard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disk and cd (change directory) over to another user's homedir, but,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assuming standard, normal permission settings on the folders in those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; homedirs, I can only see the files in their Public/Dropbox and Sites
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; folders.  Even though my account is a privileged Administrator's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; account.  What I can see that regular accounts can not is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Application folder, System folder, Library folder, etc, of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remotely mounted system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; If, on the other hand, you select 'Guest' then you will only be able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; to see the Public Folders.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Does that help?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Maybe but a little time will tell.  Thanks alot
