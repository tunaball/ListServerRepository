<PRE>This is my opinion only.  Read it or don't - but don't complain to me 
about it.

Just got a new Cube Case from PL.  Now I got an all Black Solid Colour 
case - I think they only made about 5 of these.  It is so shiny that it 
sort of disappears like a mirror on the desk.  The Cube runs cooler by 
5-10 degrees C.  Too bad they could not use the same hooks as Apple to 
hang the cube inside - instead PL used screws, so if I want to install 
something in there I need to unscrew it.  There is no felt at the 
CD/DVD entrance as the original case had, so it seems to me dust will 
enter unfettered.  I expect my CD/DVD drive to die a little sooner than 
it would have before.  And I can see the cut lines on all the edges - 
they could have spent a few minutes polishing these out.  Feels a 
little unfinished for $129.00 US.

Slow to ship but shipping time was fast and they sent me an email 
informing me. -GREAT
It arrived FAST and I opened it.

Small scrub blemish on the back - ACCEPTABLE
Large SEAM down back - OK but not impressed now - looks a bit cheaper 
than I expected
	- but hey, it's a solid colour - I don't need to look at the back, but 
if I ever sell it ...

Missing 2 bolts to attach the DC/DC to the plate - SLOPPY - I found my 
own
- that's 3 things not quite as it ought to be.

Video included on a CD with QTime + Text file + PDF  - grea..  WAIT
It will not play in a DVD player - It is not a VCD - Better have 2 
computers if you need to watch while installing.

This Could Be, Should Be Better.  And that's why I think they are 
sloppy.

I am happy but I can see that there are some (in my case) small things 
that should be complete.  Makes you wonder, if they miss the small 
stuff, what happens with the big stuff?  This was my first purchase 
from them and I would deal with them again but they are not anywhere 
near Apples quality - at least in this 'case'.
