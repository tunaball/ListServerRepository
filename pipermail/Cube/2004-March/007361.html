There is no distinction between your normal password and your 'admin
login password'.  You are either classified as an administrator,
allowed to do administrative tasks with your normal login (but
required to re-certify your identity by providing *your* password when
requesting the system to perform an administrative task), or you're
not.  There is no seperate admin password.  And you have the option to
grant admin privileges to any additional accounts you create on your
machine (for your boy friend, mother, roommate, whatever) or not.

There is a real admin account (referred to as the root account), but it
is typically disabled by default by Apple.  It can be enabled if
desired, but rarely if ever required.  And definitely not required to
perform such tasks as remotely accessing Shares.

As an experiment I just tried remotely mounting my Cube's filesystems
onto my Powerbook using my housekeeper's non-administrative-enabled
account (I happen to know her password since she hasn't changed it
from the one I gave her initially when I created her account).  She
only has an account on the Cube, not on the powerbook.  'She' was only
offered the opportunity to mount her own files or my dropbox (a place
to put files you want to share).  No opportunity to mount the complete
system disk was offered to 'her'.  You should be able to deduce from
this description that I'm 'pretending' to be her.  As far as the Cube
is concerned, since I know her password, I am her.  As far as the PB
is concerned *I'm* asking for this remote filesystem to be mounted. 
As far as the Cube is concerned *she* is doing the asking.

Confusing, isn't it.  I'm doing my best to try and clarify things
here, but I fear I may be mudding up the waters.


&gt;<i> If I am at the computer named GIMLEY with login password of DWARF
</I>&gt;<i> and my server upstairs is CURIOUS GEORGE with login password of BIG 
</I>&gt;<i> YELLOW HAT
</I>
Why would you use two different password for yourself to access your
own machines?

&gt;<i> I can get access to Curious George from Gimley with the password DWARF  
</I>&gt;<i> - is that correct?  Or do I need to use the pass BIG YELLOW HAT?
</I>
In your case, no, you'd have to use BIG YELLOW HAT.  But more important
than that, what are you using as the login name (in the Name: box)?
Are your login names the same on both boxes?  If so (and that's logical)
why wouldn't you use the same password?  The machine doesn't have a
password, your account does.

&gt;<i> Is there a place on the server computer that allows me to specify a new 
</I>&gt;<i> password for networking
</I>&gt;<i> ie. Computer - Gimley - pasword - SHORTY to access this computer via 
</I>&gt;<i> network. (instead of DWARF)
</I>
The password is tied directly to the account on the the local box.  In
your senerio, there is no 'networking' password (I'm qualifying that
comment because in senerios where all machines rely on a centrally
managed Netinfo server, there is such a concept as a 'network'
password, but it's still tied to the user's account, not the machine).  

There's something askew in your view of things here and I can't quite
put my finger on it.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Point being, you want to fill in that Name: field with the login
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; name of the account on the remote machine.  Either the full name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or the 'short' name.  Then enter the password you use on that remote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine to login as if you where sitting down in front of it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Next you will see a dialog box offering you the opportunity to mount
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up on your local machine one of the available filesystems on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remote machine.  This can be an iPod, an iDisk, your home directory,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or even the remote machine's entire hard disk (you probably will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; required to have an administrator's account on the remote machine to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mount up the whole disk (I would think, but I'm not sure because I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *am* the administrator on all my machines).
</I>
&gt;<i> In OS 9 you could specify what disks or folders would be shared with 
</I>&gt;<i> whom via the GET INFO on each file/folder/disk.  Is there any such 
</I>&gt;<i> control in OS X or is it only Guest access or ALL access via proper 
</I>&gt;<i> pass login?
</I>
It's close to that, but not exactly.  Accounts that have been granted
administrative privileges get access to what you refer to as ALL, but
regular accounts only get access to their own home directory and the
Dropboxs of all other accounts.  Guests only get access to the Dropboxes.

But, this access to ALL for administrative enabled accounts is not
entirely unrestricted.  I can mount up my remote machine's entire hard
disk and cd (change directory) over to another user's homedir, but,
assuming standard, normal permission settings on the folders in those
homedirs, I can only see the files in their Public/Dropbox and Sites
folders.  Even though my account is a privileged Administrator's
account.  What I can see that regular accounts can not is the
Application folder, System folder, Library folder, etc, of the
remotely mounted system.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If, on the other hand, you select 'Guest' then you will only be able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to see the Public Folders.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does that help?
</I>
&gt;<i> Maybe but a little time will tell.  Thanks alot
