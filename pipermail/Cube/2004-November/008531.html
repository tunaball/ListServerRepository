<PRE>Stefan,

About 2 months ago I installed the 1.3 GHz GigaDesign.

It has no fan, so is as silent as the original.  There seems to be no 
heat problem, but I have no means of checking core temperature. 
Subjectively, it seems, if anything, cooler than the 500MHz it 
replaced. (Perhaps I should say that I have the Cube standing on two 
strips of gel - a wrist-rest which I cut in half. Partly, I did this 
because I am clumsy and occasionally jog the table and the gel acts to 
absorb the shock, and partly it provides a less restricted area for the 
cooling on the input side - I have no reason to think that this 
improves the cooling, other than my own vivid imagination!)

Since installing it, I have had 3 Kernel Panics, only one of which 
surprised me at the time. But since the third one, I have remembered 
that none of the routine maintenance tasks had been done - I had 
switched them off, intending to do them manually, and then forgot! 
Since re-instating these, there has been no problem (4 weeks).

I use a powered USB hub in the belief that this will draw less current 
from the Cube. However, I do use Firewire for scanning and HD back-up.
If that has cleared the problem, then I have a machine with 120GB HD, 
1.3GHz, 1GB RAM, and SuperDrive. For my purposes, I cannot see a need 
for any further upgrades.

David.
