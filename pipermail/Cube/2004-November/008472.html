<PRE>I must say I am sorry that I moved on to the imac G5, but this thing 
rocks pretty hard.

The Cube took an 8 1/2 x 8 1/2&quot; square in the corner of my desk.  I had 
the PL upgrade Case in solid black (like a mirror) and an Apple 15&quot; 
Studio Monitor (ADC).  I had an OEM GF3 and a 40 gig 7200 HD.  I was 
ready for the CPU upgrade.

I compared the cost of a new imac at $1500 and the re-sale value of the 
Cube on ebay.  And then consider that a 1.2 GHZ CPU still costs near 
$350-400.  Now, I live in Canada and sometimes the exchange Apple gives 
or the resellers prices really suck.  But I happened to be in Florida 
and grabbed my new imac in Bocca Ratton - long and short was that I 
saved a bundles in taxes and exchange (legally).  I listed my nice 
shiny Cube on the LEM list and with no bites went on to ebay.  $950 + 
shipping in 2 hours + 10 minutes.

My new imac cost me all of $550-600 US.  Apple is an awesome product.  
I cannot imagine trying to sell a 5 year old IBM clone for more than 
maybe -next to nothing- and yet Apple products have a very good value 
retention.  It's all about style, usefulness and availability.  I am 
certain that in 4-5 years this imac 17&quot; 1.8 GHZ G5 will hold a value 
for all the qualities my Cube had.

I am sad to see my Cube gone but I got something bigger, faster, and 
just as unique, not to mention a wee bit more desk space.  The only 
other drawback I can see now is the lack of RAM in these things - it is 
really starved for RAM.  And it aint cheap either.

Sorry, but these imacs are very nice and monetarily make pretty good 
sense.  Big upgrade in HDs, Superdrives, CPU, Screen Size (for me), 
Space consumption, and Bluetooth.

I think these really are a Cube Killer package as feared from the 
beginning.

Thanks

jj
