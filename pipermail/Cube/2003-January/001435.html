<PRE>No problems with the DVD player and my 2MX -

I would venture to guess that you don't have the proper drivers 
installed - which in itself is odd, as they should be included in your 
base install of OS X (since 10.1, when I installed my card).

Swapping out the fence was always a given, and you won't notice super 
performance in the Finder - but you will notice an improvement when 
things get straightened out.  Absolutely.  You'll have quartz extreme, 
and some more video ram to play with, but it still won't be the end all 
be all performer (the finder is just plain slow, still).

Anyhoo,

Check here to see if you have the proper drivers installed/present 
(would be cool to check out your startup system.log to see which driver 
is being loaded upon boot, too).

/System/Library/Extensions/GeForce2MX.kext - kernel extension for this 
card
/System/Library/Extensions/GeForce2MXGLDriver.bundle

They're both under a MB, so I can stuff 'em up and email them to you if 
you like.
