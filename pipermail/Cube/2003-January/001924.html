<PRE>Yes, it absolutely is a matter of personal taste, and I certainly don't 
begrudge your choice. I was simply pointing out that, while it is an 
effective solution for you, I don't think it's something that will 
appeal to a great number of people.

By &quot;defeat[ing] the whole point of the Cube,&quot; I meant that stringing an 
internal mechanism via IDE cable violates the elegance and compactness 
of the Cube, which were two of the Cube's big selling points&#8212;although 
admittedly, an external Firewire drive has a similar impact on the 
compactness score. And I don't think many would be comfortable running 
the Cube outside of its enclosure for an extended period of time. But 
it works for you, and that's really all that matters.

</I>&gt;<i> Option 1 you list costs $500.
</I>&gt;<i> Option 2 you list costs $300 and won't work.
</I>&gt;<i> Option 3 which I explain below costs $200 and three short two by fours.

</I>&gt;<i> If it's all about what your Cube looks like you are right and you will

</I>&gt;<i> Cube&quot;? The Cube remains silent and cool. You have the added benefit of 
</I>&gt;<i> the DVR-105 and iDVD 3. I don't see the downside excepting the 
</I>&gt;<i> appearance which I consider to be irrelevant. It's a matter of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There's obviously lots of interest about how to use a DVD burner with

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> categories:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Option 1. Those who would like to put a slot-loading SuperDrive (such 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as the one in the PowerBooks) in a Cube
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Option 2. Those who are interested in using a Firewire DVD burner but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would like to use iDVD, due to its simplicity and far lower price 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than DVD Studio Pro
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately, neither of these options are possible right now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Frankly, I don't think there is much interest in running a Cube out 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of its core with an internal DVD burner mechanism attached, as this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sort of defeats the whole point of a Cube. It seems to me that it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would make more sense to replace the Cube and buy a similarly-powered 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Power Mac G4 and replace its optical drive with a Pioneer DVR-A05 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanism than to run it out of its core with an internal mechanism 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attached via ribbon cable.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> iDVD 3:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Pull the core.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Build a small 3 sided square of 2x4s just smaller than the core

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Disconnect the optical power and IDE connectors from the internal 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> optical drive.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4. You will see they are long enough to reach outside the Core and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> plug into the raw 105.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 5. Reattach everything else and power up.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 6. Forget about how it looks.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 7. Leave it on the floor where it belongs in the first place. IMHO
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Do that and you're iLife iDVD 3 compliant.
