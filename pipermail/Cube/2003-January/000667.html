</I>I had this happen to my slot load DVD and a CDRW drive before. Basically,
you have to remove the drive from the cube, open the cover of the drive (two
small screws on the sides, and then look at the mechanism, make sure there
are no foreign objects or problems with the mechanism. Once I found a dime
in the drive. The other times, the plastic parts of the drive were out of
alignment. Specifically, it seems the centre spindle that latches on to the
CD with a magnet can easily dislodge. Especially with repeated forceful
attempts to push a CD in. By tinkering, for lack of a better term, I was
able to fix the drives, and they have been working since. Sometimes, through
shipping or mishandling, they can get &quot;diskombobulated&quot; &lt;sp?&gt;. Surprisingly,
they were easy to fix. The first time I did this, I assumed the drive was
toast and decided I couldn't make it worse. I fixed three drives this way.

A techie friend may be able to look at it for you, or bring it to a service
dealer. You can buy DVD slot drives for under $50 these days. When my CDRW
drive malfunctioned, I was looking at $180 to replace it. Luckily, I was
able to fix it.
