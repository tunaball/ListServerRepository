I've wanted to bring up this topis for a while now. The eject 
capability of our CD drives get progressively worse over time and I 
guess most of us have this problem by now. As it is, I have to think 
twice befor I put a CD in my drive becuase 90% of the time it won't 
manage to get out. I've found that there are certain brands of media, 
mostly those that have 'printable' surfaces that have no problems with 
ejecting them, but I have a load of CD's and I don't want to copy all 
of them. I guess the rubber got oily/dirty and slips on the CD surface.
Most inkjet printers eventually suffer from the similar problem with 
their paper feeders and you can buy a paper with a sticky surface that 
you feed through the printer several times and it removes the dirt from 
the rollers. I had to do it a couple of times and the results are 
great. That made me realize that we need a similar thing for our drives 
- a CD with a sticky surface that would remove the dirt from the 
load/eject mechanism. Of course, there is no such thing, but I do have 
an idea - I will put some tape that sticks to both sides on a CD and 
see what happens. Will let you know about the results :))
