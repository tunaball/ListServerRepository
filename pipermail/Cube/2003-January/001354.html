<PRE>I love this list. I read it often and I have to agree with Mr. Rodman. 
It's getting petty and argumentative.
I've been a member of other lists of this kind over the years, and the 
behavior of there members also have developed
in much the same way as it has here.

What makes one better than another is the caring of those who've taken 
it upon themselves to serve for the benefit of all.
Which is why this one is better than most. The person who has taken the 
responsibility of serving for the benefit of all of us
is doing an excellent job. So when we act childishly and become 
argumentative, we can only hope it doesn't reflect on her.

Mr. Rodman please except our apologies if we've given you the wrong 
impression.
What goes on here isn't a true picture of how we actually treat each 
other, but merely a few people with much to much time on there hands.

Thank you Laurie Duncan for all you do.

Don Linares

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know what it is with you guys.  There used to be a thing

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> her moderate it and BAN people who can't express their opinions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> politely or who needlessly insult people.  We must, of course, make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allowances for people for whom English isn't their first language.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This list has been helpful at times.  But reading it these days gives

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> LOL - boy are you going to make a lot of enemies today :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm guilty of running off at the mouth myself sometimes. I'm only 
</I>&gt;<i> human,
</I>&gt;<i> after all, but I do try to at least stay civil and professional and 
</I>&gt;<i> express
</I>&gt;<i> my opinions in the most forceful way I can, without being a total d*ck 
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> it. Some might say I fail at that task, but I think I keep a good 
</I>&gt;<i> grasp on
</I>&gt;<i> things most of the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no interest in &quot;taking over&quot; the list (a sigh of relief is 
</I>&gt;<i> heard in
</I>&gt;<i> the distance...) These lists take on a life of their own. I have my 
</I>&gt;<i> hands
</I>&gt;<i> full just moderating the cubeowner forums. It's become a much more time
</I>&gt;<i> consuming task than I ever imagined and there are never enough hours 
</I>&gt;<i> in the
</I>&gt;<i> day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was reminded the other day, by an iChat buddy, of a saying we all 
</I>&gt;<i> need to
</I>&gt;<i> be reminded of from time to time:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Arguing on the internet is like running in the Special Olympics...
</I>&gt;<i> Even if you win, you're still retarded.&quot;  (no offense intended to 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone, so
</I>&gt;<i> please restrain yourselves from telling me how offended you are that I 
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;make fun&quot; of anyone with a disability)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Much to our dismay, this list will likely continue to go on in 
</I>&gt;<i> dysfunctional
</I>&gt;<i> cycles, just like families do.  The best we can hope for is occasional 
</I>&gt;<i> order
</I>&gt;<i> amidst the chaos :)
