Ok...that means essentially that the startup process can't find a valid 
startup folder.
You can follow Laurie's advice (and others as well) and try booting 
from the iBook, but that won't solve the drive problem.
It also sounds like the drive has become misaligned. I am a bit 
reluctant to suggest that you try the realignment of the drive 
mentioned by Bill Wong and others in some of the previous posts-it's 
not that hard to do, but since we don't know how good you feel about 
cracking the case and doing the realignment you'll have to make that 
call for yourself.
Are you in contact with the seller? Have you asked if the drive was 
working when you bought it? I'm guessing it has become misaligned 
during shipment. It's not unusual for that to happen. One thing about 
shipping the Cube is that you REALLY need to pad the sucker because 
some of the tolerances are pretty tight.
If you are comfortable doing it, crack the case and do the realignment 
as per one of the earlier posts. OR, take it to an authorized dealer 
and have them do it.
