&gt;<i> I don't know what it is with you guys.  There used to be a thing called
</I>&gt;<i> 'netiquette', but it seems to be gone today.  I think the best thing
</I>&gt;<i> for this list would be to appoint Laurie as owner of the list and let
</I>&gt;<i> her moderate it and BAN people who can't express their opinions
</I>&gt;<i> politely or who needlessly insult people.  We must, of course, make
</I>&gt;<i> allowances for people for whom English isn't their first language.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This list has been helpful at times.  But reading it these days gives
</I>&gt;<i> me a headache.  Please think before you click Send!

LOL - boy are you going to make a lot of enemies today :)

I'm guilty of running off at the mouth myself sometimes. I'm only human,
after all, but I do try to at least stay civil and professional and express
my opinions in the most forceful way I can, without being a total d*ck about
it. Some might say I fail at that task, but I think I keep a good grasp on
things most of the time.

I have no interest in &quot;taking over&quot; the list (a sigh of relief is heard in
the distance...) These lists take on a life of their own. I have my hands
full just moderating the cubeowner forums. It's become a much more time
consuming task than I ever imagined and there are never enough hours in the
day. 

I was reminded the other day, by an iChat buddy, of a saying we all need to
be reminded of from time to time:

&quot;Arguing on the internet is like running in the Special Olympics...
Even if you win, you're still retarded.&quot;  (no offense intended to anyone, so
please restrain yourselves from telling me how offended you are that I would
&quot;make fun&quot; of anyone with a disability)

Much to our dismay, this list will likely continue to go on in dysfunctional
cycles, just like families do.  The best we can hope for is occasional order
amidst the chaos :)

Laurie
