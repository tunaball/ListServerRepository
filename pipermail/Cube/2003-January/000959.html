<PRE>Slotted Superdrive for Powerbook G4s (and Cubes perhaps?) - From a 
reader email today (since the cube also uses a notebook type slotted 
drive, I suspect it might also work for the Cube)

&quot; I am surprised no other sites have mentioned this, although MCE 
clearly  has other issues (since only one of four Macworld 
announcements is  listed on their homepage <A HREF="http://www.powerbook1.com">http://www.powerbook1.com</A> ).
Apparently MCE will be offering SuperDrive upgrades for PowerBook Ti  
owners starting February 25th for $449. The site has no other info  
(does that price require trade in of the existing drive?) and in fact  
has not yet been updated to show three other announcements that were 
supposed to be revealed Jan 8 (Superdrive ug for iBooks?) Jan 9  
(External DVD Burner of some sort?) and Jan 10 (some drive for iMacs?).
However I spoke to the local MCE authorized repair center and they  
confirmed the program and the price but had no info on availability  
(but commented on how hard it is to get the mechanisms for their  
previous Ti Book dvd to combo drive upgrade program).

As the owner of a Ti 800 DVI I am really very excited about this - I  
waited as long as I could to buy this machine last spring but finally  
work pressures forced me to make the purchase before SuperDrive  
equipped PowerBooks were released. It is especially appealling now that 
  I can get iDVD for $49 as a part of the iLife retail offering.
thanks
