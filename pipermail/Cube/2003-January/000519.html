<PRE>Hi Cubists!

My mother-in-law's Cube 450, which I take care of but see only once 
every three months, is behaving oddly.

- the realtime clock resets itself to 1900 after the Cube is powered 
off for a varying period of time. Sometimes 1 day, sometimes 3 days. Is 
there a easily replaceable battery on the mother board? If yes, could 
somebody please point me to the correct specifications?

- when I visit again next Easter, I want to upgrade from 9.2.2 to 
10.2.3 (or whatever is current then). As a test, I used Carbon Copy 
Cloner to make a bootable image of my DVI TiBook onto an external 
firewire drive. The TiBook will boot without problems from this 
external drive. When hooking up the drive to the Cube, however, the 
boot process stops without an error message while still displaying the 
gray apple logo. In fact, it appears as if the logo hops down 3 or 4 
pixel lines and then the machine freezes. I also tried setting the 
TiBook itself in firewire target mode, but the Cube was equally 
uncooperative. Was I wrong in assuming that my TiBook's OS X 
installation (it is an original 10.1 which has gone through all 
incremental updates) is bootable on the Cube? I of course don't have 
original system disks with me to try a fresh install directly on the 
Cube.

- the 15&quot; studio display is missing the top three scan-lines, which are 
just displayed gray. I tried pulling and reinserting the Rage 128 card, 
checked the cable and flicked my fingernail against the display, as one 
does with stuck pixels. No help. I assume, since it is out of warranty, 
that it will be cheaper to replace it than to repair it?

Sorry for batching the questions into one message - I'd appreciate any 
expert comments.

Cheers,
Christian
