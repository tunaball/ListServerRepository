<PRE>The problem, gentlemen, is that if I sell drives which go in a Cube, I 
have to (a) pay someone $60/hour to design the sheet metal; (b) come up 
with a source for the connector adapter, if needed (does anyone know?); 
(c) produce the sheet metal; (d) write a procedure and test it on at 
least two different cubes; (e) advertise it; (f) collect money and ship 
the drives; (g) deal with people who complain that they installed it 
perfectly and it still doesn't work, insist on free replacements, 
bad-mouth the product and accuse me of being a rip-off on public 
mailing lists, and all sorts of other negative mental energies.

Even if I can get the drives for $50 each, the items (a) thru (f) are 
going to add at least $50 to the price (since the entire market is, 
what, 1000 drives sold to cube owners?), and item (g) is going to make 
me say, those 1000 cube owners can jump in a lake, it isn't worth it.

I don't know what it is with you guys.  There used to be a thing called 
'netiquette', but it seems to be gone today.  I think the best thing 
for this list would be to appoint Laurie as owner of the list and let 
her moderate it and BAN people who can't express their opinions 
politely or who needlessly insult people.  We must, of course, make 
allowances for people for whom English isn't their first language.

This list has been helpful at times.  But reading it these days gives 
me a headache.  Please think before you click Send!
