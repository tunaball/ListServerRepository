Have u ever though about that most Palestinians are christs and not
muslims if not - look it up ;) Second of that they lived in this region
long before the Jews founded Israel!!! They claimed it, because it was
written in the Bible - very good contract ro claim someones land. I
don't have pretty much symphatie for the muslims either - they punished
my country over 600 years and my family was almost wipped out in the
13th century (yes I can trace it back) - we lost our lives, land and our
peerage - my surename comes from a nickname my ancestors had to carry.
Now we come to the personal part:

I also had many cetniks in my family along with the rivaling partisans -
but both did the same: they defeated Yugoslavia from the Germans - so
never ever try to pull the word Partizan into the dirt if u have no
connections with it!!

Boris

Ps: Mister Superman: IT WAS U THE FUCKING STATES OF AMERICA WHO TRAINED
BIN LADEN AND SUPPORTED HIM WITH OVER 3 Billion $ - PAID FROM UR TAXES -
THINK ABOUT THIS FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
