<PRE>I've been a Cube List subscriber for a long time.

I don't post too often here anymore because I'm pretty sure spammers 
got my e-mail from skimming the archives.  My Mail.app junk mail porn 
rules are working pretty well these days so here goes...

I would never try this, I'm quite happy with my GeForce 3 but for all 
of those folks who are trying to squeeze those bigger video cards in, 
how about using a smaller Notebook sized 2.5&quot; or even the smaller iPod 
drives in place of the larger 3.5&quot; hard disk.  It would be slower for 
disk, but it would open up some space to move the DC-DC Board to a well 
ventilated portion of the Cube (nearer to the central chimney) as well 
as the drive itself would run cooler than its 3.5&quot; counterpart via 
lower power consumption and a greater surface area to volume ratio.  
IBM (or whoever they sold their drive operations to) is supposed to be 
coming up with some faster notebook drives with larger caches and 
higher rpm.  The toughest part would be modifying the mounting and 
coming up with the adaptor board from the laptop style ATA/power to the 
regular full sized connections.

For some of you Radeon 9000 or bust folks, this might be the ticket.

What do you think?

BTW, those slot loading superdrives from MCE sure look nice but will 
they sell them to Cube users?  As far as I know, they never came 
through on their original promise to sell the combo drive to Cube 
owners.
