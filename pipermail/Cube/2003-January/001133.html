<PRE>I believe I have tried every resetting trick in the book - open firmware
nvram reset, pram reset, motherboard magic button, you name it.

As far as I am concerned, if a Cube wakes fine with it's stock processor but
will not wake with the upgrade board, then the fault's with the upgrade
board. Apple would say the same and so I think would any objective onlooker.

It cannot be a kernel problem if the problem is manifest across multiple
versions of both OS9 &amp; OSX, can it?

My guess is that there's a duff bunch of G4 CPUs out there which won't wake
from sleep. Why PL don't just replace the faulty board I don't know. I
understand Sonnet had similar problems (although far less of them) - they
just replaced the boards and everyone's happy.
