I don't agree. Taking a (insert product here) that fits in laptops, 
desktops, and cubes and adding a sheet of metal to it so it can be 
mounted inside a cube isn't going to put a manufacturer out any more 
than $2. Funny though, that $2 difference seems to jack the price by 
$200-$400.

If you don't mind, then pay for it. I, on the other hand, am going to 
let it be known what I'm willing to pay, especially since there are 
sales people on this list, and people on this list reporting to the 
manufactures of these products. Seriously, look into the actual costs 
of these drives. When you know how much they REALLY cost, let me know 
if you're willing to pay an extra $300, on top of the profit they 
already made.

Seriously, there's a mechanism that spins the disc, there's a track and 
a motor to move the laser, and there's a laser....along with some cheap 
electronics and sheet metal. A grand total of about $50 or less.
