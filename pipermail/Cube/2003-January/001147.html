<PRE>My 50/50 chance wasn't meant as statistical fact - just a figure of speech:)

I don't know that PL could actually determine an exact percentage of cards
that are effected, without contacting AND speaking with every single
customer directly - or recalling every single card (a drastic action). Not
everyone reports problems that aren't important to them. Personally, if my
PL upgraded machine WERE affected, I'd never know it, because I haven't let
a computer of mine sleep for years. Energy Saver settings are the very first
things I disable when a new computer comes out of the box. No computer sleep
(and mine are on 24/7), just a display dim overnight.  The only reason I
tested sleep functionality was because I knew some people had the problem
and they had asked me to note whether my card had the same problem. So for a
few days I used sleep as others do, and I had no issues sleeping or waking.

On 1/15/03 2:13 PM, <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/cube.html">mherrebout at real.com</A> added a note to the human symphony
when this was said:

&gt;<i> Probably not 50/50.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A replacement card's chances of not exibiting the coma problem would
</I>&gt;<i> reflect the current ratio of coma/no coma cards being shipped by PL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if the percentage of 'coma cards' coming out of PL is 10*, then the
</I>&gt;<i> chances of solving the problem with a new card is 90%.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * complete fabrication; I have no idea what this really is; if it is
</I>&gt;<i> exactly 50, then disregard this post entirely -- the original was correct :-)
