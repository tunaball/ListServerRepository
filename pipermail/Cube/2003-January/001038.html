Awhile back, I went crazy looking for a second enclosure because I had 
(thought anyway) designed the perfect cooling system, and it was in 
fact a sort of chimney, but never made it. I also got the enclosure(s), 
which now sit in my closet.

It seemed like the cost would keep people from buying it...I would have 
used the same clear plastics so it would have looked good, and not like 
some generic,  crappy, expensive after-market add-on.

Anyway, since people have these videos showing how to disassemble their 
cubes, and fans are anywhere between $3 and $20, I think the chimney 
would be too expensive. Plus it would need an external power source 
(unless we could use firewire or usb...but that would still be a bit 
clunky).

The panaflo is the best option. I got mine down to around 7v-9v with 
help from a list member, and it's REALLY quiet....much quieter than at 
12v, and keeps the system at a constant 90f/32c with a Radeon 7500 even 
after heavy gaming. When I pull the core out immediately after use and 
touch the components, they feel cool to the touch (even the video 
card's heat sink)

the moment):
