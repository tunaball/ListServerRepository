<PRE>Thanks Guy that's useful.

However what we have here is a coma rather than a wake-delay and it occurs
in OS9 as well as X.

The symptom is that the computer will appear to react to the wake-up call -
hard disk will leap into life but the display stays off. The computer itself
is I think still asleep as it does not respond to things like the eject
button or volume keys (which would give feedback other than just via the
display). This happens 100% of the time - not an intermittent issue like
some sleep problems.

For what it's worth I have installed a brand new OS on an erased hard drive
and still have the same issue. In fact I've booted from the OS 9 CD and
still the same - coma every time.

James
