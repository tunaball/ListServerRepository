<PRE>As most of you probably know, OWC is selling CPU upgrades from Giga 
Designs that are cheaper than Powerlogix and Sonnet offerings. I'v sent 
a mail asking about the possibility of using their CPU upgrade in a 
Cube, and got the following reply:

Hi Riba,

In order for our current board to fit in a cube, the heatsink would have
to be replaced with a custom bracket. The cube has challenging thermal
characteristics, and the Motorola 1GHz 7455s are rated at a mere 65
degrees C. If we were to create this custom bracket, would you as a cube
owner be willing to pay a dealer for an hour of his/her time? If not,
would you be willing to put up with a lengthy video, and disassemble 80%
of your cube? Please give us your feedback, as we are seriously
listening to the enthusiastic group of cube owners.

Thank you for your inquiry,

Tim Ericksen
Product Manager

Hello there,

As you are probably aware, the same processor module that can be used
in older AGP G4 machines can be used in discontinued Apple Mac Cube
machines. There is a large community of Cube users looking to upgrade
their CPU's, and at the moment both Powerlogix and Sonnet are
supporting Cube with their upgrades. I can't expect you to invest funds
into extensive testing of your modules in a Cube, nor to provide
detailed manuals how to perform a rather involving installation in a
Cube. However, many Cube users have alreay upgraded their machines with
a cooling fan and would be very happy with info if your module can be
used in a Cube regarding its dimnsions and power requirements. It would
be also good to check if your module fits on the supplied heatsink ina
Cube.
Any info would be more than welcome!

</PRE>
