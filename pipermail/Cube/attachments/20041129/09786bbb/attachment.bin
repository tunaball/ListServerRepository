I tried the PRAM trick several times, but no success.


I cheked the "About this Mac" and discovered that (under PCI/AGP)
there is no videocard at all shown. 


This means that there must have happened (after I pressed this
reset/cudaswitch on the inside) that made the videocard invisible. So
how to get the Cube to recognize the fact that there is a card
installed?<fontfamily><param>Helvetica</param>
