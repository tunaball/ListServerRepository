I would pull the core again, reseat the video card and the RAM.

Double_check all the external connections (power, USB, video, etc.).

Alas, I checked and rechecked (maybe .10 times). All connectors are
neatly in their sockets.


Another thing I discovered is that there is no videocard at all
visible in "About this Mac" in the entry "PCI/AGP".


In principle I do not mind getting me a new(er used) card but I first
need to be sure a card replacement will solve the problem otherwise it
is a waste of money.
