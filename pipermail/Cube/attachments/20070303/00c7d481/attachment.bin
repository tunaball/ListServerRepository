 Also, does anyone know if Tiger will install and operate with

any success in an old G3 400 mg Powerbook or is that pushing it?

My opinions follow:


Re: What are your expectations in going to Tiger?


Have you checked out all the system requirements for it  along with
other apps or websites you may want to enjoy

using it?  Just a caveat, for instance, if you plan on using the most
recent , iLife features, all of them may not work.

Have you've done major upgrades to the Cube? Packed in the Ram? New
CPU? New Video card?


Also see: cubeowners.com and check out discussions at macFixit about
probs with recent security updates, too.


If you have a wonderful Pismo, it should be very snappy with Panther
10.3.9, and others have reported slow downs with Tiger.
