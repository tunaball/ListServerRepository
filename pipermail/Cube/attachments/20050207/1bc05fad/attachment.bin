<excerpt>Does anyone happen to know of the little round plexi-glass
cube USB speaker

system works well with the mini? I tried them plugged into my G3
powerbook

and it was all distorted - pretty useless.

I have a PC and a Cube both connected to a cheap Sitecom KVM and the
Apple keyboard/mouse and the Cubespeakers are all shared.


The sound coming out of the speakers is very good. So no problems, I
didn't even have to load drivers on the PC for them.
