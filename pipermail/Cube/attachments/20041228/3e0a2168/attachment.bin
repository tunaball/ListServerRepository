Sorry to say but I have this cube that has worked without any hassle
for over 6 months. I had to replace the videocard because it had a
malfunction.


Now I have a Radeon 7000 and all the trimmings and everything works
just perfect! With 1 exception!


If (and only if) I power down then it is (almost always)  impossible
to get it started again. When i does not start I have to take the core
out, press the switch on the logic board and then it starts without
any problem.


The problem is (quite certain) not caused by the new videocard since
when I plug in an original videocard then I have exactly the same
problem.
