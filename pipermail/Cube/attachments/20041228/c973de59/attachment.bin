<excerpt>Wahoo!  Glad to hear its working.  May I ask, what is
"patchburn?"

</excerpt>

Patchburn does 2 things:


1.  It places two tiny files in your homedirectory. This activates an
unknown feature by which you are able to create a.DMG instead of
writing to real DVD. Also it enables you to choose the DVD burner if
there are more than one.


2.  It makes a profile of any burner on your system and places this in
some system directory making OS X think it is an accepted drive.<fontfamily><param>Helvetica</param>
