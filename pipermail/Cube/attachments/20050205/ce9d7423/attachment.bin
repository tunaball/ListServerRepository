<excerpt>David,

That is very interesting! Although my cube did not have any problems
until I had to replace the videocard, it might be similar.

Was there a visible misplacement? In my case it looks fine. I suppose
one has to unscrew those little 2 visible screws whereby the whole
metal comes loose?

I really hope this might be my problem since I have been banging my
head against the wall lately.

gr,

Ton

black washer about 25mm dia combined with a white disc, and this
combined object had become misplace

a space between the core and the case itself..


There have been many problems with this part and are still available
at no charge

from Apple.

How does that "thing" work? Since there is apparently no electronics
in it. Do you maybe have a partnumber and can I order that as a
privatperson?<fontfamily><param>Helvetica</param>
