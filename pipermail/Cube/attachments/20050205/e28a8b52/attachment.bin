David,


That is very interesting! Although my cube did not have any problems
until I had to replace the videocard, it might be similar.


Was there a visible misplacement? In my case it looks fine. I suppose
one has to unscrew those little 2 visible screws whereby the whole
metal comes loose?


I really hope this might be my problem since I have been banging my
head against the wall lately.


gr,

Ton

to start, unless I removed the core.  The fault was that there is a
black washer about 25mm dia combined with a white disc, and this
combined object had become misplace
