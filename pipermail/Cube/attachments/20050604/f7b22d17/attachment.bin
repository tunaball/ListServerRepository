What is it?

<excerpt>process of increasing the clock frequency of your Central
Processing Unit (CPU), Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), Memory, PCI,
and/or AGP devices. In other words, making your computer run faster
without having to spend the money on upgrades.

Here is an explanation of overclocking:

<excerpt>How is a processor overclocked?

The most common (and simplest) way to Overclock a processor is by
simply raising the Front Side Bus (FSB) from within the BIOS. The
process is the same with both AMD and Intel CPUs. Simply enter the
BIOS on system startup, find the setting for the FSB and increase that
value. - If you are unsure where this option is in the BIOS, take a
look at your motherboard manual, as it should have that information
for you.

how to go about it if I wanted to.)

<color><param>0000,0000,6666</param> I joined the list one moth ago
more or less. I've bought a Cube on  eBay that wasn't working. It
turned out to be a defective DVD unit.  Once replaced (one hour ago),
it looks like it's working.</color>

<color><param>0000,0000,6666</param> A preliminary visit to the system
profiler shows a processor speed  of 550 Mhz, and I've noticed that
has an internal fan. The hard  drive is a 10 Gb Quantum, that probably
is not the original one as  I think they were shipped with 20 Gb HD.</color>

<color><param>0000,0000,6666</param> But what about the 550 Mhz? Is it
overclocked? Maybe a third party  processor upgrade + fan?</color>

<color><param>0000,0000,6666</param> It seems to be overclocked. Third
party upgrades started with 800 MHz.</color>
