Hi, Ben,


Oddly, I had been thinking of selling my Cube to get a PowerBook; I
was inclining towards a 15", but have been using a clamshell iBook
which has a 12" screen for some time, so I don't guess it's that big a
deal---there are certainly advantages to the smaller machine.


My Cube is in near new condition and unmodified. That's not to say you
couldn't find any signs of use anywhere, but it is in quite nice
shape. I have the original box and packaging as well as the manuals
and original CD's. I also have an equally nice 15" Studio LCD display,
also with its original box. It makes for a very attractive, completely
silent, and completely reliable workstation.


Please tell me a bit about the condition of your PowerBook. Do you
have the original packaging? 


Thanks,


Travis
