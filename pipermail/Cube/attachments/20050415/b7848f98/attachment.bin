Hello

<excerpt><fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param><color><param>2221,2221,2221</param>I
hope to upgrade my CPU from my current 1 GHz to a new dual but I have
Boot ROM Version: 4.1.8f5. Can I upgrade the firmware with the 1GHz
installed or do I have to find a stock CPU in order to upgrade the
firmware?</color></fontfamily></excerpt>
