Hi Cubers! I have asked this before but haven't received and answer
that works........my Cube won't power up when I push the power button.
I bought a new power box but that didn't fix the problem. If anyone
knows how to force it to start up or knows what the problem could be,
I would really appreciate the help. Thanks, Melvetta from Oklahoma

I've been using the 20" ADC Cinema Display with the ADC Radeon 7500 in
my cube, and it's been flawless.
