Or (most likely) I am not a civil employee and did not take the time
to measure my Cube (which is barenaked at the time) and my Shuttle and
so I dud just an estimate. 


Besides that, is it really important what the exact diferences are? On
my desktop they live in peace with each other and do not quarrel over
anything.

dark times)
