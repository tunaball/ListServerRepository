I have a Cube (regular condition, no special cards) that works
flawlessly 24/24 and 7/7.  It has no speel/wake up problems whatsoever.


1.  However from time to time I have to restart it and then most of
the time it will not start anymore. Also when I "press" the
startbutton, the lite goes on nothing happens and the light goes out
when I remove my finger.


It will only start when I remove the core, press the S1 switch (Cuda?)
on the logic board, put back and then it starts and works flawlessly.


Question; What can I do to solve this problem since it is driving me
mad.



2. Maybe related maybe not. I have noticed that (while working oke)
the lite on the Cube is sometime on, sometimes off and sometimess
flickers rapidly. I have a service manual, however can find nowhere
how exactly the lite should behave.


<fontfamily><param>Helvetica</param>Question: Should this lite burn
yes/no and what may cause this erratic behaviour?



Solutions are welcomed, thanks for any.


Met vriendelijke groeten,
