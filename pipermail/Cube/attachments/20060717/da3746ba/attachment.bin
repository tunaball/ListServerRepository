<excerpt>It's hot here in southeast michigan (low 90s) and I just
noticed that the oh-so-scientific dial thermometer that I stuck in the
top grill of my cube was registering 120 F instead of the more usual
110 F.

So I grabbed a small muffin fan (50 mm?) and set it on top of the
grill and the temperature dropped to 95 F.

I guess I have to admit that a proper cooling fan might be a good idea.


I understand that there is already a fan power connector built into
the cube.

Is there a special fan I need to fit my cube (and it's connector)?

Can I make the fan switch on when the cube heats up (and off when it's
cool)?


Thanks

technology is the answer, what was the question?
