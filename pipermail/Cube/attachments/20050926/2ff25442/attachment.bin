Hello

I've been lusting after one of the Apple Cinema Displays but am not
sure what I'll get if I plug a 20" Cinema display into my Cube.

I've got a ATI Radeon 7500 32MB  ADC VIDEO CARD N10476.

The Cinema display resolution is
<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><color><param>3333,3333,3333</param> 1680
x 1050.

The Radeon 7500 card claims to support:

1600x1024    85 85 85

1600x1200   76 76 76

1600x1344   85 85 85

None of which is exactly the same as 1680 X 1050.


So can I use a Cinema display or am I better off with a conventional 4
X 3 display?


Thanks
