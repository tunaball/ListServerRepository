Hello friends,


reading in the list tonight let me think about my own situation.

I own two cubes in good condition which are only 
waiting for better days, - unused for years now, 
standing in my office.
(but they are loved &amp; apprecitated, I want to underline :-)


Is there anyone in the list who would buy them 
(with real love and interest would be fine)?
In fact I don't want to sell them as a bargain, I have to admit.

They should give a good price, as they are in 
very good condition and good equipped too.
I think they are too worthfull to become old and elder without being needed.


Please let me know about your interest and price-ideas.
I live in germany, shipping in the european union 
would be affordable, but I would ship worldwide, 
although that's not so cheap.

---CUBE 1---
450 MHz, max. RAM of 1.5 GB, HD 160 GB, Graphic 
ATI 128 optional GeForce 4 MX, ADC+DVI (with 
VRM-board - what's the right english expression: 
VRM-board is sitting at another place)

---CUBE 2---
Powerlogix 1.5 GHz upgrade (with 1 MB BSC),
1.5 GB RAM, HD 160 MB, ATi RADEON 9200 DVI+VGA 
(but it is the fastest one with DVI and ADC, 
cooled passive)

Both graphiccards (GeForce+ATI 9200) do have twin 
mode (two display with different content)
Both cube are in good-best technical and optical condition.
Both come with original speakers and of course power&quot;brick&quot;.

No mouse, no keyboard (which would be german of course)
Optional I have a 15&quot; Apple ADC-TFT-Display (of 
the same series, that fits optical)



Would you please tell me appropriate prices and - if interested - contact me.
It is no necessity to sell, but a real idea.
And, as mentioned, I shall not sell at any price&#138;


best regards, friends
Stefan
