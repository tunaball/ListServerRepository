The two different networks are just that - two different networks in  
two different locations. with two different names.

The reason that you see one as strong and fast and the other as not  
so good is that it (the weaker one) is probably farther away from  
your receiving antenna. It is probably in the next house past the  
good one or in a house across the street.

If you can enter both, that means that neither of these networks have  
activated password protection and their nets are available to anyone  
who walks or drives by. Dangerous activity, that!

As far as choosing the better network, as long as you configure your  
Mac network preferences to always seek the network that you already  
have permission to use, you are good to go. If this is the weaker  
network, then you could seek out the owner of the stronger and ask  
permission from him/her.

I would do as I already have - pay for my own access and protect it  
from intrusions with a password. That way, I don't have to rely on  
the generosity of someone who might get a case of the mads at me for  
something or another and cut me off in the middle of an important  
session. What will you do if they turn off their wireless modem or  
suffer a power loss in the house?
