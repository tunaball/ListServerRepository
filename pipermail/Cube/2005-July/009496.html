<PRE>Welp, at five years almost TO THE DAY, my old Cube has finally become more trouble to me than it is worth (You just KNEW this was coming, right? ;^)).

After trying to get it back together and working again, I decided to put the HD in a FireWire housing and sell the rest of it.  Yes, it is still in a million pieces, but you can have it for a song.  It has 448 MB of RAM, and OWC Superdrive, an OWC internal fan, an Apple OEM GF3 graphics card w/firmware update to drive 20&quot; and 23&quot; Cinema displays (But I have removed the dead fan), an AirPort card, and a fresh battery (Still in packaging).  I also have an extra Apple OEM GF2 w/o the firmware update that I'll throw in since I won't be needing that as a backup anymore, and the original DVD-ROM drive as well.  There is a hairline crack in the shell at one of the retaining posts, which has been there since I bought it as a factory refurb.  You'll get the Apple Pro speakers AND an iSub (In box) that I used once, hated, and never used again, plus the black/clear Apple mouse and keyboard.  You'll just need an HD, an ADC monitor (Or non-ADC monitor and adaptor), and the patience to put it all back together.  My busy gigging and blogging schedule made that process quickly become a &quot;fuggedaboudit&quot; proposition.  All original software and manuals are also included (No OS X at that time).

1] No, I won't part it out: All or nothing.

2] PayPal payment in USD only.

3]  I will only ship to a US mainland address.

I was literally moments away from pulling the trigger on a fully loaded Mini when the Intel... ah... intel came out, and was hoping the Cube would stay cool until '07.  Didn't happen, so the new Mini is on the way.  I do a LOT of selling on eBay, so I know how to pack things so they could be dropped from a plane and still be OK.  First reasonable offer takes it.  E-mail me off-list at <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/cube.html">pep27 at mac.com</A> if interested.  No reply within a week, and it goes on eBay with a bunch of other stuff I've been needing to get rid of.

Ciao,

Pep
</PRE>
