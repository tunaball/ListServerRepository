<PRE>Hello Andrew,

Did you set the hard drive to master b4 installing it in the Cube.  
Hard drives are often set as cable select but the Cube has the hard  
drive set as master and the CD-DVD player set as slave.
There is an eject button on the top right on your keyboard  hold that  
down when you start up or hold down the mouse button.
The button under the Cube that sticks out is for resetting the Cube.  
The other one is for updating your Boot-ROM-version (Firmware) should  
be version 4.1.9, if not update.
The CD inserts with the label to the front of the Cube.
One way to see what is available to boot from is to hold down the alt  
key when booting. You will get a screen that lets you chose what to  
boot from.
Otherwise you just hold down the c button.
I definitely think Tiger is worth the money Safari is much faster and  
Mail much improved and I use dashboard all the time.
Do a search in Google for g4 cube manual.
What's the Lombard?

Joel

&gt;<i> Hello again.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to a hint from David Flory
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=58686">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=58686</A> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I was able to swap out the hard drive in my cube.
</I>&gt;<i> I actually wasn't that hard just different than any other computer.
</I>&gt;<i> So the new hard drive is in and I figure to boot from the OS 9.1 CD  
</I>&gt;<i> and install 9.1 on the smaller partition.
</I>&gt;<i> But when I put the CD in and start up while holding down the  
</I>&gt;<i> command (splat) key and the &quot;C&quot; key I get the &quot;folder with question  
</I>&gt;<i> mark&quot; and I can't start the machine.
</I>&gt;<i> To make things worse I don't know how to get the CD to eject.  
</I>&gt;<i> Command &quot;E&quot; doesn't do it and neither does unplugging and restarting.
</I>&gt;<i> I looked for a hole to put a paper clip into but of course that's  
</I>&gt;<i> way too crude for my elegant puzzle cube.
</I>&gt;<i> I tried pressing the two buttons underneath (near the ethernet  
</I>&gt;<i> port) but although they made the machine whir they didn't eject the  
</I>&gt;<i> CD or cause the cube to boot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some history:
</I>&gt;<i> When I got the cube it would boot to OS 9.0 from the 20 Gb drive  
</I>&gt;<i> and would also boot from my OS 9.04 CD.
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to update it to OS 9.2.2 (this was before I was introduced  
</I>&gt;<i> to OS X) and in the process of updating the hard drive stopped  
</I>&gt;<i> booting.
</I>&gt;<i> Now that I've got another hard drive installed the CD drive isn't  
</I>&gt;<i> working (or at least won't boot).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Questions:
</I>&gt;<i> How can I eject the CD?
</I>&gt;<i> Which way do I insert the CD? I assumed label side towards operator  
</I>&gt;<i> but I've been wrong before. putting the CD in backwards would  
</I>&gt;<i> explain why it won't boot or eject.
</I>&gt;<i> Do I hold down &quot;command&quot; and &quot;C&quot; to boot from the CD?
</I>&gt;<i> Why do I have two little buttons underneath? I assume one is reset  
</I>&gt;<i> but don't know which one.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there much difference in the Mail and Safari applications  
</I>&gt;<i> between Panther (3.9) and Tiger (4.1)?
</I>&gt;<i> My experience with OS X is limited to 3.9 on the Lombard so I'd  
</I>&gt;<i> just as soon put Panther on the cube and minimize the learning  
</I>&gt;<i> curve (panther's also cheaper).
</I>&gt;<i> If Tiger offers big improvements in Mail and Safari then I may have  
</I>&gt;<i> to get Tiger on the Cube and then put it on the Lombard...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll go poke around the Apple site and see if I can't find an  
</I>&gt;<i> owner's manual...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all your suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i> -- 
</I>&gt;<i> Andrew in Ann Arbor
