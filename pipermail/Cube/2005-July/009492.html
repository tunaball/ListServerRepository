<PRE>Heya Cubists -

    Have had a quite annoying problem with this puppy for more than a year
now, though the frequency seems totally random: Sometimes, my Cube just
turns right off. As if I'd just yanked the plug right out of the wall.

    Now, previously, I'd read where some Cubes would spontaneously &quot;sleep&quot;
due to issues with the thermal switch on the top, and the fix for this
involved making a slight modification to the inside of the housing to
better-insulate the switch. This may or may not have done anything -- the
problem is so erratic, it's hard to tell.

    I put in a little bit of circular stick-on paper there, and also turned
off the automatic power management in Preferences. The computer stopped
dropping to sleep. 

    Now, sometimes, it just drops power entirely. Konks right out. It'll
power back up at the touch of the switch, and sometimes stay on for up to
two weeks at a time, but eventually, it's bound to just drop dead again.

    So I got to wondering: The power supply on these things; are they known
to have issues? My troubleshooting keeps pointing me towards &quot;power supply,&quot;
but I'm hesitant to drop $80 (best price I've found anywhere, at OWC) on a
new power supply if that's not the problem.

    Any pointers you have are of interest to me, thanks in advance.


Cheers,
A.J.
