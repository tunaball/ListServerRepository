<PRE>Jim, you can make an OD cable from a Mac floppy cable.  They both are 20 
pin cables.  I might even have a spare OD cable around here.  Most OD's 
are dead these days and a lot of people pull them to make room for a 
second hard drive or even an internal CD-ROM.  A caddy load CD-ROM can 
be mounted so the caddy clears the OD slot.  If you want, I'll look 
around for the cable.  I have one functioning optical drive and 6-8 
disks.  I don't use them anymore, just have one for effect.

Check out the NeXT archive at Peak and Peanuts.  There are a lot of 
formerly commercial apps that have been released as freeware.  Also 
check out Omniweb.  It's the best browser available for NS/OS cubes and 
a one box site license is free.

One thing you want to check is the fan rotation.  The cube originally 
shipped with the fan pulling air from the case and it's intake was the 
OD slot.  The dust kileld most OD's very quickly.  NeXT's fix was to 
reverse the cooling fan to pull air in the case and exhaust it through 
the OD and the bottom screen.  There was also a fiber filter supplied 
from NeXT that fit over the back of the OD and filtered the air flow. 
Tim over at www.channelu.com has a lot of documentation and tips as well 
as being one of the two remaining suppliers of black hardware.  I also 
have a reproduction of the NeXT factory service training manual and the 
official NeXT 400dpi Laser Printer repair manual.  I've been hoping to 
find the time to scan these manuals and make them available for download.

James

Jim Clark once said:

Thanks Steve.

I have gotten the NeXT up and running and on my home network. I have
used the browser but not much else. I purchased a optical drive but I
am not sure if it works. I needs a 20 pin cable which I have to find. I
also have no Optical Disc Media. I am in no hurry.
