<PRE>A.f.a.i.k. and as far as I can interpret from the messages on this list 
and the forum on cubeowner, PowerLogix is the only possible option as 
of today. Their single CPU upgrades are working ok in most of the 
cases, aside from the problems with the L3 cache. Their dual 800Mhz CPU 
upgrade has blown a couple of DC-DC boards with Cube owners, and they 
have now withdrawn this product from their price list. It seems they 
got their hand on better processors and rumours are they will announce 
dual 800, 1GHz and even 1.2GHz upgrades pretty soon. But no specific 
details are available yet.
So, to give you my feeling: I'm grateful I've waited doing an upgrade, 
though I have been tempted to order one multiple times the last couple 
of months. I sympathize with the folks that took the risk and ordered 
the 800Mhz dual upgrade and now are stuck with a broken Cube.
In general I think there is a certain risk involved in upgrading the 
Cube, as it was initially not designed to have processors with more Mhz 
(and more heat) let alone to have dual processors inside. On the other 
hand, if there is any chance I can ensure I will have a satisfactory 
computer experience with this beautiful device for a couple of more 
years, rather than having to move to a shaving mirror or a computer 
more resembling a Boeing 747 landing on Heathrow (check out 
http:www.g4noise.com, especially the Dave Raven Swith commercial), I 
would take the risk. So, if the planned upgrades from PowerLogix 
announced for January seems to be ok, I will go for it, otherwise I 
will go for a single 1GHz. But upgrade I will... It's just a matter of 
time.

cheers
Rob
