I guess I don't appreciate the difference.  I guess you could say that
there are two sources of errors, the memory or the parity generator /
checker.  If the data error originates elsewhere the parity is applied
and checked without a problem.

&gt;<i>Secondly,

&gt;<i>or behave erratically, a data error in actual data will cause it to run

</I>
If I set or reset a bit in the execution code I don't think it'll run
just fine.  All of this stems from way back when in the dark ages of
computing.  Back when they used core memories, and discrete ram cells.
Because the technology was so unreliable, they needed a way of checking
for errors, hence parity.  IBM put it in the PC, because they always
had.  Modern DRAM is so fast and reliable that it's just not needed.
I've never had a memory error on any of the Macintoshes I've owned (Macs
have never used parity).  They seem to be well engineered.  The only
time I've ever even seen a memory error was in the early days of the IBM
clones, when the clone makers kept cutting margins to be a little faster
than the other.

&gt;<i>I'm sure we can all appreciate the inclusion of data integrity checking
</I>&gt;<i>mechanisms in the machines that control nuclear power plants and
</I>weapons
&gt;<i>systems, right?
</I>
Most high reliability systems use EDAC if there's a possibility of a
problem with memory, otherwise you design in enough margin.

Bob.
