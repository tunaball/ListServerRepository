<PRE>Me too - As my video card has sleep issues the machine is &quot;always on&quot; 
like Ken,  I have the display going to sleep after 15 minutes. The 
upside is it always appears on the network. I have a number of 
computers (AI portable, son's iMac, new iMac G5) airported throughout 
the house with the Cube sequestered in the studio with a laser 
printer attached which is also always on and sleeping. It is nice to 
have any of them print to the Cube and the laser printer. In 
addition, I use Netopia's Timbuktu and visually bring up all the 
different machines on each other's monitor's. Tres cool.

The Cube is the only computer I can't sell. I recently bought an iMac 
G5 2.1 GHz (iSight model) as I wanted a PPC G5 with AppleCare before 
they all ended up running on InSmel's. I have too much invested in 
pro PPC software to go down the Intel/hell upgrade road - yet. I 
fully thought I would sell the upgraded Cube. (have it maxed out with 
RAM, 120 Gb Barracuda, upgraded video card, Sonnet 1.2 GHz processor 
etc. Dual monitors. But then couldn't bear to part with it. Ha. Only 
time this has happened with any computer I have owned. These Cubes do 
find a place in our visual heart. As nice as the iMac G5 is (running 
a firmware patch that allows dual monitor spanning/virtual desktop 
across the 20&quot; internal and a 20&quot; NEC in portrait mode) the Cube 
doesn't have to make an apologies as it still feels pretty darn zippy 
by comparison.

Didn't mean to ramble.

&quot;My addiction isn't drugs or alcohol - it is more expensive... my Mac's&quot;

&gt;<i>Same here - it just runs 24/7 - never sleeps, but the display goes
