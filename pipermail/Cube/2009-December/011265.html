<PRE>Not being mechanically inclined, I use that service from time to time,  
most recently to repair one of my 23&quot; Cinema HD Displays (Not the  
ancient lucite model I use with the Cube, but the newer aluminum one I  
use with my G5!).  It varies from product to product, but the CHD was  
225.00 if I remember correctly, and it took them two tries before they  
figured out the power supply was burning the monitor out.  Apple has  
several repair centers in the US now, and the closest to me is 75  
miles away in Austin.  It only took three days per trip to ship and  
receive the monitor.  That's pretty speedy.

Ciao,

Pep

</I>&gt;<i> Air.   I was reading something online and found an article saying  
</I>&gt;<i> that Apple was replacing the video card on some pervious models of  
</I>&gt;<i> MBP.  I pulled it out and called Apple and of course my did not have  
</I>&gt;<i> that model video card.  But I went ahead and made a Genius Bar  
</I>&gt;<i> appointment.  I am thinking the whole drive (ATL rush hour traffic)  
</I>&gt;<i> to the Apple Store that I was wasting my time.  I go in and explain  
</I>&gt;<i> what happened and he hooked it up, reproduced the problem, and took  
</I>&gt;<i> it to the back.  After a while he comes back and says they think it  
</I>&gt;<i> is the LCD screen because the screen came on (although white) and  
</I>&gt;<i> the e
</I>&gt;<i> xternal monitor worked.  He tells me about a program I have never  
</I>&gt;<i> heard of before.  For a flat fee ($315 for MBP) they send it to  
</I>&gt;<i> Apple Repair and they will repair it (no matter how many parts) for  
</I>&gt;<i> the flat rate of $315.  If there is any &quot;accidental&quot; damage (drop  
</I>&gt;<i> etc,) they will call you with an estimate for the repair.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought it was a no brainer $315 for a computer that is still  
</I>&gt;<i> worth over $1,000.  The battery had swelled and he replaced it for  
</I>&gt;<i> free and had me sign the paperwork for the new battery.  He enter  
</I>&gt;<i> the repair for the MBP and had me sign.  As I am walking out the  
</I>&gt;<i> store, I remembered I did not pay him anything.  I go back and ask,  
</I>&gt;<i> don't I need to pay you the $315?  He said no the service is on us,  
</I>&gt;<i> because of how he enter the battery replacement the service printed  
</I>&gt;<i> out with no charge.  So now I am waiting patiently for the MBP to  
</I>&gt;<i> arrive in the AM. (They overnight all the shipments.) The repair  
</I>&gt;<i> status actually says &quot;REPAIRED&quot;!!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enjoy your Mac....
