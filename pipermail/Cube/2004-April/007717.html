<PRE>Go and listen and make up your own mind.
To me, the G5 seems much quieter than say my Cube with a GF3 in it.
Not that I heard my G4 Sawtooth much, but the G5 seem quieter.
G5 is much quieter than the old MDDs.
The new MDD is not nears as loud as before and the G5 still seems to 
have the silence edge.

The G4s and G5s that are available kick the crap out of my 450 Cube in 
almost every way except size/space requirements.  Ever with a 1.4 PL 
upgrade, 1.5 RAM and a fast HD the Cube is still out performed by the 
slowest (dual) G4 or (any) G5 purchased new right now.  And that's a 
tricked-out Cube vs an off the shelf new computer with no upgrades.  
Max out the G5 and the comparison is totally absurd.

Face it, we use these Cubes for A) Asthetics, B) Space requirements, C) 
Money constraints D) Fear of change or E) Total Silence F) Speed is 
Acceptable (for most tasks you do) - if there is another reason I 
missed then you can tell us why you use the Cube still.

I use my Cube because B) Space Requirements are low enough it fits on 
my corner desk and F) Speed is Acceptable for my tasks consisting or  
ebay selling w browse &amp; email or photo and music management w itunes, 
iphoto &amp; Toast.

Just what do you want out of a computer in its first released 
generation (G5) or an old Cube design that has not been updated for 4 
years?  So, YMMV and you need to go judge them for yourself.
