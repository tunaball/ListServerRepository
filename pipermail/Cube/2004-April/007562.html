<PRE>Sorry, I guess I should have known, from your original post, that English
is not a language you are fluent in.

&quot;Umm, say again?&quot; is a somewhat slangy way to say: I'm sorry, but I
didn't understand what you said. Could you look at what you said and try to
rephrase it in a more understandable way? Perhaps you didn't really mean
what you attempted to say, too.

It is not meant to be taken literally.

The reason I said it was that the sentence didn't make much sense to me.
You said: A few listers have had luck, so you should be okay.

a) &quot;Luck&quot; isn't sufficiently specific. I surmise, from what
follows, that you meant &quot;good luck&quot;. But, except in cases like &quot;you're in
luck&quot;, luck could mean bad or good, as opposed to &quot;lucky&quot;, which normally
means &quot;having good luck&quot;.

b) Logically, your statement is similar to saying &quot;A few people have won
the lottery, so you should, too.&quot; Or perhaps better, &quot;A few people have
survived fevers with temperatures over 112 degrees, so you should be ok.&quot;
Admittedly, more people play the lottery than are on this list, but the
fact that a &quot;few&quot; haven't yet burned up their cards is hardly an
indication that &quot;you should be okay&quot;.

  To the original poster:

&gt;<i>From what I've seen, the GeForce3 is a gamble in a Cube. It was not
</I>designed for the Cube, and the Cube wasn't designed for it. It was not
offered as an option by Apple in a Cube.

Is it worth $350? Apparently so, if ebay prices can be taken as a guide.
Would I pay $350 for a replacement for the one that burned up in my Cube?
Not on your life, especially since I have a GeForce2 in it now, and don't
see any significant performance degradation. And if I win the lottery, and
have more money than I know what to do with, and decide to put up with the
noise, I _might_ put a GeForce3 back in, but only with an aftermarket fan
on both the card and the Cube itself.
