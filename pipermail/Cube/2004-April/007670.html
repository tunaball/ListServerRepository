<PRE>Luis,
  In a nutshell, my problem is:
1. The WEB site works perfectly stand alone (i.e. http//10.0.2.201/)
2. The WEB site works perfectly with just the computer connected to the net (http//www.bumala.com (or http//207.213.217.244)) 
3. With the airport connected to the net and set to map port 80 through to 10.0.1.210 port 80, the web site times out.
According to all I have read on the subject, this should be all I need to do, but it doesn't work.
Thanks,
Bob.

Bob,

I might not have well understood your question but... I think you're saying you can't access your website while doing it through the machine that's hosting it... the CUBE itself. Isn't it so?

Well... I experienced (and still) this problem with a dinamic IP (and not a static one as yours). So the solution (for me) was to configure it using this service:

&lt; <A HREF="http://www.dyndns.org/">http://www.dyndns.org/</A> &gt;

Actually, I'm still not able to access my website when typing the domain address I chose from dyndns: <A HREF="http://xxxx.ath.cx/~user/">http://xxxx.ath.cx/~user/</A>
But, if I replace it by the airport's range IP number: <A HREF="http://10.0.1.2/~user/">http://10.0.1.2/~user/</A> it shows up just perfect.

I'll try to find the link/URL describing this kind of *glitch* when using an AirPort configuration while hosting a website and post it later here if you want.

Once again, sorry if I somewhow messed things up and I'm not even achieving your issue. My intention was always to help and not to confuse.

</I>Hi All,
  We just got DSL service in our area, and we now have a reasonably fast Ethernet connection with a static IP address.  I'm trying to set up my cube to host a web site.  So...  I set the cube to a static local IP address of 10.0.1.201, enabled web sharing, and installed the web site.  I checked it out by browsing 10.0.1.201, and the page displays just fine.  I set up the airport extreme for port mapping sending port 80 to local IP 10.0.1.201 port 80.  I also set the advanced settings to make 201 the default host.  I got nothing.  When I browse my static Ip address (207.213.217.244), it just times out.
  So, I hooked up the network directly to my Ibook, and browsed my static IP address, and it works just fine.  So now I'm out of ideas.  I checked the httpd logs and I noticed that I get traffic from all of the usual data miners (looking for robots.txt), and some I think trying to plant worms, but I can't seem to get through.
  I set the airport to send it's syslog to the cube, but it doesn't seem to make it.  Do I have to change some settings on the cube to accept it?  Where would the airport syslog show up?  Anybody have any ideas I could try?

Thanks,
Bob.
