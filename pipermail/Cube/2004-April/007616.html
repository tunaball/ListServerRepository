</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lots of questions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Are you in fact burning on the Cube, either externally or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internally?
</I>&gt;<i> External,  Que branded.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  If externally, do both drives on the Cube see the disks?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Have you tried loading one of your &quot;data&quot; disks in a third machine,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either Mac or other?
</I>&gt;<i> A HP and Dell both see it but, of course, can't read it.
</I>
OK, see it how? Does it show up under &quot;My Computer&quot;? Or see it and give an
&quot;inaccessible, incorrect function&quot; alert?

&gt;<i> &gt; 3) What exactly do you mean by &quot;data&quot; disk?
</I>&gt;<i> They are OS updates from the Apple web site.
</I>
Right- but are you burning as Mac only, Hybrid (Mac/PC), ISO 9660 ?

&gt;<i> &gt; 4) Does this occur with different media brands?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5) Have you tried burning a &quot;data&quot; disk with OSX alone?
</I>&gt;<i> Just finished trying to burn a cd of the downloaded OS updates using
</I>&gt;<i> the Que
</I>&gt;<i> attached to the iMac. Neither machine, the Cube or the iMac &quot;see&quot; it.
</I>&gt;<i> *Not*using Toast with this trial. I inserted a blank cd into the Que
</I>&gt;<i> and got a dialog box
</I>&gt;<i> on the iMac asking me if I wished to burn it, and I clicked on OK.
</I>
OK, so the Que, externally to the iMac, burns the CD using OSX alone, but
neither the iMac nor the Cube is able to mount it? Curious.

&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe Toast is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem, or at least your installations of it.
</I>&gt;<i> Whatever i burn with it seems to work on everything but the iMac. Even
</I>&gt;<i> burn from the
</I>&gt;<i> iMac using Toast is readable everywhere else I have tried.
</I>
But iMac using the OSX built-in burner burns a disk than the Cube won't
mount, right?

&gt;<i> &gt; 6) When you say that the CD is not even recognized by the iMac, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assume
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you mean that it doesn't appear on the Desktop, or the Finder window
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; panel.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes the one can hear the cd trying to &quot;mount&quot;. the cd drive
</I>&gt;<i> spins. It sounds
</I>&gt;<i> like the speed is varying like the machine is trying to read it but an
</I>&gt;<i> icon never appears
</I>&gt;<i> on the desktop.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does it show up as there in the System Profiler
</I>&gt;<i> No it doesn't.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or when issuing the df command in the terminal?
</I>&gt;<i> The few times I have tried to use the Terminal, on either machine,
</I>&gt;<i> I get the message that the &quot;command was not found&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure how to do what you are asking.
</I>
df not found? hrmph. try /bin/df

&gt;<i> &gt; 7) I'm not sure this will work, but it may be worth a try: Install
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Toast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the iMac, and see what shows up under Recorder-Disk Info.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Lost&quot; my original copy of Toast, (long story) and have been using a
</I>&gt;<i> copy that
</I>&gt;<i> I burned using the Que drive. Works everywhere but on the iMac.
</I>
If you have the two networked, that's not a problem.

&gt;<i> &gt; 8) Have you tried mounting a &quot;data&quot; disk burned by a different burner,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either Mac or other?
</I>&gt;<i> Have not had a chance to locate anyone to burn from another machine.
</I>&gt;<i> But one a friend made for me probably two years ago that used to work
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> work now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 9) Are you burning cd-r or cd-rw?
</I>&gt;<i> Both, same result.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  have you tried more than one burn speed?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. No difference.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 10) Is there anything that you changed (if you can remember) on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; iMac
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shortly before it stopped seeing your disks? Hardware or software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes?
</I>&gt;<i> The problem developed slowly. First it just refused to see an
</I>&gt;<i> occasional disk.
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't fight it too hard as I had just gotten the Cube and was
</I>&gt;<i> blissfully unconcerned.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does the iMac only refuse to see disks recently burned- that is, does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now refuse to see disks that it used to see before it started having
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem?
</I>&gt;<i> It sees the audio discs that I burned with it and the Que.
</I>&gt;<i> As I have worked on this problem, I have used Toast to burn data discs
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> are readable on other machines but not the iMac. Tried a .dmg earlier
</I>&gt;<i> this evening
</I>&gt;<i> thinking that might work.
</I>&gt;<i> *Not*.
</I>
So you burned a .dmg, using Toast burn image option on the Cube, and the
iMac doesn't see it?

&gt;<i> What is the difference between a &quot;factory&quot; burned disc and one made &quot;at
</I>&gt;<i> home&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> The iMac seems to recognize all &quot;factory&quot; discs but not others.
</I>
In many cases, just a fancy label.

&gt;<i> I have even tried to read it from the 9.2 partition on the drive. No
</I>&gt;<i> luck.
</I>&gt;<i> Just tried a back-up &quot;data&quot; disc containing old mail that I saved from
</I>&gt;<i> the iMac and it is not
</I>&gt;<i> recognized by the iMac but is seen by the Cube. Audio discs made at the
</I>&gt;<i> same time
</I>&gt;<i> with the same burner do work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to set the iMac up for a 12 year old and do want to give
</I>&gt;<i> him something that
</I>&gt;<i> will leave a bad impression on him and be a source of amusement for his
</I>&gt;<i> friends.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there maybe something disabled that sould not be?
</I>
Nothing that I can think of that would survive a migration from 9.x to
OSX. OSX has a finder option to _not_ show CD's on the desktop or sidebar,
but that's not likely the solution. Given that the problem came on
gradually, it might be a hardware breakdown, but it remains puzzling. I'm
temporarily stumped. I've burned thousands of disks on macs and wintel
boxes, and run them on dozens of machines, and never seen this particular
behaviour.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for everyone's help.
</I>&gt;<i> I know that we can find the answer, we're Mac users!
</I>
Good attitude!
