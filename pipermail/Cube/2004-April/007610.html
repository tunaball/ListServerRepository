<PRE>Lots of questions.

1) Are you in fact burning on the Cube, either externally or internally?
If externally, what brand of burner? If externally, do both drives on the
Cube see the disks? If internally, have you tried attaching an external
drive to the Cube for testing purposes?
2) Have you tried loading one of your &quot;data&quot; disks in a third machine,
either Mac or other?
3) What exactly do you mean by &quot;data&quot; disk? What settings are you using? I
ask because many &quot;factory&quot; cds are simply &quot;data&quot; disks, too. No auto-run,
no bootable. If they run, why not yours?
4) Does this occur with different media brands?
5) Have you tried burning a &quot;data&quot; disk with OSX alone? Maybe Toast is the
problem, or at least your installations of it.
6) When you say that the CD is not even recognized by the iMac, I assume
you mean that it doesn't appear on the Desktop, or the Finder window
panel. If that's the case, does it show up as there in the System Profiler
(unlikely) or when issuing the df command in the terminal?
7) I'm not sure this will work, but it may be worth a try: Install Toast
on the iMac, and see what shows up under Recorder-Disk Info. If nothing
else, if that works, it is a handy way to eject the non-recognized disk.
8) Have you tried mounting a &quot;data&quot; disk burned by a different burner,
either Mac or other?
9) Are you burning cd-r or cd-rw? Single or multi-session? If you haven't
tried a single session cd-r only, try that. I'm hard pressed to see why it
would matter, but have you tried more than one burn speed?
10) Is there anything that you changed (if you can remember) on the iMac
shortly before it stopped seeing your disks? Hardware or software changes?
Does the iMac only refuse to see disks recently burned- that is, does it
now refuse to see disks that it used to see before it started having the
problem?
