You, at least, admit that English is not your native language. But you
clearly understand enough to distinguish giving advice from sharing
experiences. This list is about both. Had you simply said &quot;I've had good
luck with mine&quot;, you wouldn't have heard a peep from me. But you gave
advice.

I was not attacking you personally. I was trying to make the point that
the advice given wasn't good, to perhaps prevent some future reader from
being misled by it, and (hope springs eternal) to make future posts of
that nature less common.

I don't know what other threads you are referring to. But if you are
referring to two recent ones in which I have participated, both started
with posts that gave wacky advice. I would characterize them as bizarre
only in the respect that the advice-giver didn't immediately correct it,
but chose, in one case, to compound the errors, and in the other, to act
like a juvenile.
