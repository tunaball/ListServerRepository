Let us first set things in their proper order.

Do not buy OS-10.2 because 10.3 is better. Buy your own copy of  
OS-10.4 only if you have a DVD player to use for the installation. My  
reason for advising the purchase of your own installer copy is that  
you may not be able to borrow your friend's copy quickly when you  
have a problem and need to fix it NOW.

You must have a DVD player connected to or installed in your Cube in  
order to use any OS 10.4 install DVD. That version OS does not come  
on a CD. If all you have in the Cube is a CD reader, you are out of  
luck for installing OS-10.4 without some external help.

Another thing that OS-10.4 needs is a lot of RAM, be sure to install  
over 512Mb in the Cube. You should have lots of RAM installed anyway.  
It is much cheaper now than it was earlier and there is no longer an  
excuse for not putting in as much as you need or can afford.

If you want to run Classic environment programs (OS-9 or earlier),  
you must install that OS in your Cube. To get a version of OS-X that  
comes with a CD to install OS-9, you will have to search for an  
available older version for sale on eBay or maybe on Craig's List.  
Again, look for OS-10.3 instead of 10.2!!!!

As long as the CDs are generic installers (meaning that the disks are  
not labeled for any SPECIFIC model Macintosh such as an iMac,  
PowerBook, or an Intel chip model), you should be getting both the OS- 
X and OS-9 installer CDs in the packet. Do the OS-X installation  
first and then do a Clean Install of OS-9 to avoid the installer  
asking you if you want to erase any existing OS before installing  
another version.

As to the USB devices not being recognized, that may be because of a  
corrupted OS or possibly a dead USB socket. Have you tested the USB  
sockets with other devices than your memory cards? You could try  
connecting a digital camera and see if it is detected by the OS.

Is your ISP not compatible with Macs? Is that why you are using the  
PC for internet connections?

If you complete the installation of OS-10.x successfully, you should  
be able to use the Cube as an internet machine without too much  
difficulty in configuration. There is a helper program for internet  
access in the OS-X install that does much of the configuration for you.

Welcome to the World of Macintosh Cube owners.
