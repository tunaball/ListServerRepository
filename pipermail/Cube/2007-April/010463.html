I'm not sure where you've been recently, but there are a lot of products 
available to the general public that are not on store shelves. And the end 
product is NOT the same. If it were, this thread wouldn't have even 
started.

See above.

I suspect that Apple made the sensible decision to distribute Tiger in DVD 
form because the extra costs involved in marketing the CD version would 
not have resulted in any significant additional gross, let alone net, 
revenue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is a case of Apple learning how to get more from its customers, just 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> like MonopolySoft has been doing since Whinedoze v95.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ditto.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ditto to what? Is this a rebuttal or just a confirmation of MonopolySoft 
</I>&gt;<i> practices? Apple was doing well by its customers without copying this subtle 
</I>&gt;<i> form of extortionist pricing.
</I>
Ditto was short for: Apple prices its products in line with what it thinks
  the market will bear. What's wrang with that?

If you think their pricing is extortionist, you are perfectly free to not 
buy from them.
