<PRE>Reader reports MCE 2x DVD-R/DVD-RAM slotted Superdrive not supported in 
10.3 - As mentioned before here when they started shipping, the MCE 
(Matshita) slotted 2x DVD-R + DVD-RAM superdrive for Powerbooks and 
Cubes required  custom/modified device-plugin file for iTunes, etc. 
burn support. A reader that upgraded to 10.3 just wrote that the drive 
is not supported.

&quot; Hi Mike, You were kind enough to help me out a few months ago 
regarding a problem w/ my then newly installed (MCE slotted) DVD 
burner. I did receive the plug in from MCE, and everything worked great 
after I switched it out.
When 10.2.8 came out, at first the problem resurfaced (wouldn't 
recognize the drive after the upgrade), but I just pulled out the old 
plug-in and (MatshitaCDR.device-plugin) - which appeared again after 
the OS upgrade, and replaced w/ the one sent from MCE 
(MCE2XDVDRCDR.device-plugin) and it worked fine.

Now that I've upgraded to 10.3 I expereinced the same problem, assumed 
I could just repeat the above process and be all set, but it doesn't 
work.  First off, the MatshitaCDR.device-plugin didn't reappear and 
reinserting the MCE... Plugin didn't do anything.
Any thoughts, any of your other readers experiencing this problem? 
George &quot;

Panther does not use the individual device-plugin files that 
10.2.x/10.1.x did, mentioned in this article back in June here on 
Panther Burn Support/Mods . Unless a reader with this drive has any 
fixes, I'd contact MCE to ask if they are working on this and/or wait 
for a 10.3 compatible version of PatchBurn.

</PRE>
