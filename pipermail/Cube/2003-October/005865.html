<PRE>Sonnet Cube Install kit with VRM board Cancelled - After waiting so 
many months after the announcement I suspected this would happen, but 
it's apparently official now. Got this from a friend.

&quot;After an extensive development effort, Sonnet no longer plans to 
introduce an Encore/ST Cube installation kit that includes a new VRM 
module for the Cube. Even though the replacement VRM provided more 
power to the processor card, other Cube electrical component became 
overstressed. As a result, Sonnet will not support the Cube with 
current versions of Encore/ST 1.0 GHz and 1.4GHz processor cards.

While Sonnet regrets the cancellation of this solution, we want to 
assure our customers that a thorough research and design project was 
completed before this decision was reached. Our conclusion is that a 
100% safe VRM replacement cannot be offered for an acceptable price.

Sonnet continues to offer both high-performance and economical upgrade 
options for Cube owners. The Encore/ST G4 800 MHz and 1.2 GHz upgrades 
use processors that do not overtax the Cube's power design, and these 
are both fully supported in conjunction with the Sonnet Cube 
Installation Kit P/N SGC-KIT and professional installation. Both are 
fully compatible with the Cube, as well as all software and system 
versions through OS X 10.3.

Sonnet is hopeful that future lower-power processor designs may enable 
faster Cube solutions, and we will certainly pursue such solutions 
should they make sense for our customers.&quot;

I'll bet you'll see  7457 CPU based G4 upgrades for the Cube real soon 
now ... positive they're coming from another source. I hope to have one 
to test within days.

</PRE>
