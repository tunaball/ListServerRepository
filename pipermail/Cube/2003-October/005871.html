<PRE>Hello,

I have the Sonnet 1.2 upgrade that I bought a few months back.

After installing, I experienced the as expected 3X boost in overall
performance.  A few months after that however, I started to experience a
general instability that was first noticed with jpeg files being corrupted
in both iPhoto and Iview Media Pro.   At first, I thought it was a bad
install of Jag, and did a few re-installs, re-formats, etc.

I finally ran the Hardware test cd that came with the cube ( I forgot I had
one), and it was failing the extended test.  Not sure now what part of the
test it was failing, but it would not make it through.

I thought maybe it was some part of the Cube hardware: motherboard, etc. and
finally, I took it to my Apple service center (under Apple Care until
01/04).

After various testing, he discovered that it had one bad memory module (out
of [3] 512MB chips), and furthermore, that the Sonnet card was causing the
rest of the problems &#173; the stock 450 processor worked fine.

So, I arranged for a replacement Sonnet 1.2 card and a memory module, and
just installed them both last week &#173; had been sitting on the replacements
for a month or two.

So now, I get the speed again, but when I tried to run the Apple Hardware
test CD &#173; the Logic board part of the test failed &#173; repeatably.

My question to you all is should the Sonnet card be able to pass the Apple
test?  As the Apple test is the first line of defense when troubleshooting
with Apple, it&#185;s a bit awkward to no longer be able to use it because of the
upgrade.

And, are the any Sonnet 1.2 users out here that could try running the
Hardware Cd extended test and see if their card passes?

Any help or suggestions would be welcomed.  When I first started to have all
of these problems, I was real close to drop-kicking the entire system out to
the curb &#173; seriously; now, I would just like to know that my system is
stable so I can trust it again.  I really did lose a few files to some sort
of corruption, and I&#185;d like not to have that happen again.

My system: 1.2 GHZ (stock 450MHZ), 1.5 GB, 120GB 8MB, 7500 32MB video.

Sorry for the long post &#173; I just talked with Sonnet and they told me they&#185;ve
never tried running the hardware test cd with one of their upgrades
installed &#173; he is going to try and call back.

I would like to get a feel for what other Cube owners can tell me before I
talk with Sonnet tomorrow.

Thanks all!!!!

Regards,

Julian Tracy
