Oh come on. Look, you must be upset, but still this is childish. I run a 
Cube + Firewire HD + 10.2.8 + iChat AV Beta + the iSight with no 
problems at all. Clearly the problem is with your machine. I'd first be 
testing the integrity of your hard drive. It sounds as simple as 
corrupted data.

You claim that your 'HD crashed' but then say something about a software 
error (stuck on Apple Logo). What makes you think the HD crashed? Did 
you hear something? What you need to do, is make what ever backups 
necessary, and format the drive. It sounds sick. After formatting, run a 
disk first aid program (like Disk Utility) to make sure the disk is 
okay. Then re-install 10.2.8, iChatAV and reboot. Plug in your iSight 
and find out how high quality Apple's 'Beta' software really is! Of 
course, you could always use one of the hundreds of other web cam apps 
with your iSight - but why did you buy the iSight in the first place?

I'd originally recommend just running a disk repair utility, and perhaps 
repairing permissions, but I think it might be a bit far gone for that 
now. Backing up, reformating and reinstalling the operating system 
should only take a few hours at the most. There is certainly no need to 
buy Panther if you don't want to.

You can also hold Apple-V when you restart to see a verbose startup, 
which might give you a clue as to when the startup process is hanging. 
The screen with a return arrow and a go forward arrow is the system 
software selection screen. If you have multiple OS's installed, holding 
option at boot will present the screen giving you the option of 
selecting one of the OS's. The return arrow restarts, the go forward 
arrow continues with the OS selected. It sounds like it can't find any 
OS to boot though. I'm not sure what the screen with the black box is - 
it doesn't sound like a kernel panic to me.

Good luck
