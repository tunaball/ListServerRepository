<PRE>Well, you asked the right guy this question.  I started out with a MyTV/FM USB box for my Cube, which is now on my Xserve.  Since you already have the iMic, it would be the quickest, cheapest way I can think of.  Being USB, it has it's limitations, frame rate being one of them, but since I leave the picture at the smallest size in the lower right of the screen 99% of the time, I have no complaints. I've had the unit for three plus years, and Eskape comes out with regular software upgrades, and the unit's functionality has improved quite a bit because of this.  When I got the GF3/23&quot; Cinema HD combo for the Cube, I made it my home entertainment system, as the Xserve became my work system.  So, I got the Formac Studio TVR for it.  It's TV and so much more: It basicly turns the computer into a multimedia center with it's sound and video recording capabilities.  It's kinda like a TIVO.  Frame rate is NTSC/PAL compliant at 800x600, and since it's FireWire, no iMic.  It kicks butt.

&gt;<i>I had a great pro-grade TV tuner, AV switcher device with remote that has failed recently without hope of repair. I have been keeping my cube (450mhz, cd-rw, 1gb ram) choreless so that I could possibly move it into the home theater department. I have my iMic for analog audio and airport/ethernet for sharing (itunes, etc.). I've migrated an 80 gig HD into it and it is running 10.3.5. I have a large 33&quot; Mitsubishi Mega View monitor that has BNC inputs as well as composite video. I have used a BNC-to-15pin VGA conversion cable with success - producing a very sharp 640x480-24bit screen. I've been using a cheap tv-tuner card in a PC with a Matrox Millenium VGA card (supports wide range of refresh settings - mine works well at 57Hz) and had good results with the Mega View but the limitations on the tuner card left a lot to be desired. I'm hoping to replace the PC-TV setup I have now with a Cube-TV setup.
