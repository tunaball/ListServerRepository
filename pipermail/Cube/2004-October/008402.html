<PRE>My wife has been teaching French to first-through-third graders at 
our granddaughters' school (two granddaughters--punctuation is 
correct!) on an after-school volunteer basis.  She recently was asked 
to make recordings of some vocabulary readings for the students to 
take home.  We did this on the Cube that she uses with a USB 
microphone for input and freeware &quot;Audio Recorder&quot; to capture the 
input from the microphone.  She went on to burn the CD's on an 
external CD/DVD burner (Pioneer DVR 105 in a Firewire enclosure) from 
BOTH iTunes and Toast 6 Titanium.  Both worked just fine.  We were 
experimenting.  She found that (as long as she used the audio copy 
rather than the data copy in Toast), the file conversions were 
performed automagically in both iTunes and Toast.  I have no idea 
whether iTunes took longer than Toast, and I doubt that she would 
remember.

HTH,

Steve
