<PRE>On 7/3/03 5:34 AM, <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/cube.html">joost at jvdg.net</A> added a note to the human symphony, when
this was said:

&gt;<i> No, it doesn't. OS X installs are entirely generic.
</I>
That's not entirely true. OS X installs are hardware dependant - but they
care not about the processor. What they do care about are video cards and
optical drives, primarily. An OS X 10.2.x install will install (even from
and off the shelf retail box) different things depending on which machine it
is being installed on.  iDVD for example will not install on an iBook or a
PowerBook G4 Titanium that doesn't have a SuperDrive. It will install on a
17&quot; Powerbook or a Dual G4 Tower that has a SuperDrive.  The proper video
drivers for a 14&quot; iBook or 17&quot; PowerBook will not install on a 12&quot; iBook or
a 12&quot; PowerBook. To prove that theory, do a totally clean install of Jaguar
on a 12&quot; iBook and then clone that install to a 14&quot; iBook and see the
results for yourself. Even different optical drives (combo and cd-rw in
particular)  will result in different OS X installs - the supporting library
files are for the mechanism detected at the time of install. Try to clone it
to a machine with a different mechanism whose library or .kext file isn't
present and you'll find that Disc Burner won't detect your optical drive.
The CD itself does contain a &quot;universal&quot; installation, however, the
installer itself will not automatically place things that are not supported
or required on the machine you are installing it on.

Yes, all of this can be gotten around by using Pacifist or similar to
extract the exact files you want/need.

However, the processor speed is completely irrelevant when it comes to an OS
X install, and whatever &quot;expert&quot; made that statement knows not of what
he/she speaks.  He is also wrong about wiping your drive and reinstalling
from scratch being the solution to all post-upgrade sleep issues. Most
people here who have tried it will confirm it doesn't work. For those that
it did work, their problem was not upgrade-related after all, merely
coincidental.
