<PRE>I'm sorry, but I simply must object.  Long time Cube-listers know I don't care about computers per se, but I'm a professional musician with both B.M. and an M.M. degrees.  Not only that, but I've worked in some of the most famous recording studios in the world as an engineer and an artist (Electric Ladyland in NYC is one you may recognize).  The HK Soundsticks are a joke.  They flatter the midrange and the bass is simply all over the place.  No focus you could count on as a reference AT ALL!  I have superior sound coming out of my Cube.  How?  Simple.  I use a Griffin iMic and have the output running into a pro audio power amp.  That goes into a pair of Tannoy Proto-J near field studio monitors.  I record CD's with this settup, and I KNOW I'm getting out what I put in.  DVD's also yeild a superior listening experience with this rig.

Bottom line?  You want the last word in sound, you go pro audio.  Forget all that &quot;hi-fi&quot; garbage.

Just MHO.

Re: [Cube] Speakers &amp; Sound


David is right! The Soundsticks are incredible. I have them also and  
 got them new shortly after my new Cube but I paid about half what David  
 did. Can't remember where I got them......maybe at half.com.Well worth  
 my investment. Good luck Rich. Melvetta

 Hello Richard 
  
 I don't know how much you'd be willing to spend but I've got the Harmon  
 Kardon Soundsticks 
 and the sound is incredible. I've had people state they thought I had  
 my stereo turned up loud 
 but it was just my incredibly stylish Soundsticks. 
  
 I bought them in 2001 for $366CAD - I don't know what they'd cost now,  
 but I think they'd be 
 worth it. 
  
 They're USB and plug into the Apple's 20&quot; flat panel monitor as well as  
 into my 14&quot; iBook with 
 equal satisfaction! 
  
 Hope this helps

 &gt;&#160;&#160;Hello everyone, 
 &gt; I've had my cube for about a year now, and I have been working without 
 &gt; sound. No speakers came with my system. I purchased a pair of Benwin  
 &gt; USB 
 &gt; speakers and plugged them in. When adjusting the sound, I get the tone  
 &gt; but 
 &gt; then no other sound. I am on OS 10.2.8, 450MHZ, 256 MB, 20 GB. Does  
 &gt; anyone 
 &gt; have any suggestions or tips as to what I can try. Thanks in advance.
