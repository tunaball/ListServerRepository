<PRE>Good for you............but we're not all professionals and we don't 
all have the cash for much more cash than HK. Glad you are lucky enough 
to have the great stuff you have. M

I'm sorry, but I simply must object.  Long time Cube-listers know I 
don't care about computers per se, but I'm a professional musician with 
both B.M. and an M.M. degrees.  Not only that, but I've worked in some 
of the most famous recording studios in the world as an engineer and an 
artist (Electric Ladyland in NYC is one you may recognize).  The HK 
Soundsticks are a joke.  They flatter the midrange and the bass is 
simply all over the place.  No focus you could count on as a reference 
AT ALL!  I have superior sound coming out of my Cube.  How?  Simple.  I 
use a Griffin iMic and have the output running into a pro audio power 
amp.  That goes into a pair of Tannoy Proto-J near field studio 
monitors.  I record CD's with this settup, and I KNOW I'm getting out 
what I put in.  DVD's also yeild a superior listening experience with 
this rig.

Bottom line?  You want the last word in sound, you go pro audio.  
Forget all that &quot;hi-fi&quot; garbage.

Just MHO.

Re: [Cube] Speakers &amp; Sound


David is right! The Soundsticks are incredible. I have them also and
  got them new shortly after my new Cube but I paid about half what David
  did. Can't remember where I got them......maybe at half.com.Well worth
  my investment. Good luck Rich. Melvetta

  Hello Richard

  I don't know how much you'd be willing to spend but I've got the Harmon
  Kardon Soundsticks
  and the sound is incredible. I've had people state they thought I had
  my stereo turned up loud
  but it was just my incredibly stylish Soundsticks.

  I bought them in 2001 for $366CAD - I don't know what they'd cost now,
  but I think they'd be
  worth it.

  They're USB and plug into the Apple's 20&quot; flat panel monitor as well as
  into my 14&quot; iBook with
  equal satisfaction!

  Hope this helps
