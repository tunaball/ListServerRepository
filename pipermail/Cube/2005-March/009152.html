<PRE>Pep,

Your comments are appreciated, as I have never paid much attention to 
seeking great sound output on the speakers I've attached to my office 
and studio computers.  Instead, I use an m-audio Sonica Toslink 
connection to feed computer sound to my Sony ES based stereo outfit, 
when I want to really listen, and put the sound out to a 7.1 system of 
B&amp;W speakers.  Nothing pro grade, but it works for me.  (But then I 
think I've only twice listened to a full music CD played on a computer 
over the past 23 years since my first CD-ROM.)

That having been said, I use a couple pair of Bose Media-Mate speakers, 
as much because they can take care of sound from two speakers with 
their built-in mixer, one with the Cube / Shuttle PC combo in my 
office, and the other with two PCs in my studio.  And not to just honor 
Armand Bose only, I have a set of supposedly Henry Kloss designed 
Cambridge Soundworks SB552 speakers attached to the M-Audio Digital 
in/out card on my major studio PC.

Now, again, I don't put too much stock or concern into Mac or PC 
speakers, but these all sound pleasant enough to me for their jobs.  
But, Pep, as a trained and experienced musician and studio hand, have 
you ever heard either of these speakers, and what is your pro opinion 
of these relatively inexpensive units?

=

Now before I get flamed as some type of apostate, a member of a Mac 
bulletin board who owns mostly PCs, I must confess to having a closet 
of old SE/30s and Quadras, and to holding the hope that the 
dual-processor G5 will return to my studio (when my videographer son 
moves up to a water-cooled replacement, perhaps).  For a long while, my 
450 mHz 1.25 MB Cube has been my favorite day to day computer, one 
which I have been loath to put down for an implant of a fanless 
Gigadesign 1.2 GHz upgrade which has been in a desk draw for months!
