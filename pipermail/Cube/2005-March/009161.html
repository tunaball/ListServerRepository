<PRE>2. Problem #2: CANT USE BROADBAND MODEM AND PRINTER AT SAME TIME
part of the problem is that the Motorola Modem from the cable company that 
carries the broadband and the cable tv BOTH, fits into the same plug under the 
cube that the printer fits into. There is only one opening for this kind of 
sort of fat clip phonewire-like cord under the cube, that either the cable modem 
and printer use. I can either have flawless braodband connection or run my 
printer, not both. I am a writer, and need internet open most times, and also 
need to print during day several times. The Apple printer has a special yellow 
cord (with fat clip phonewire-like end on it) that would normally run to cube 
cause the orginal cord end that came with the 16/600 Apple printer, didnt fit 
any of the openings under the cube.&#160; (I now print by sending that manuscript via 
email to myself to ANOTHER cube across room that is hooked up to the 16/600 
printer, and print that way... it is ok, but a real gerryrigged way to have to 
print.) Wah. I am a big baby, i want my cube to work well. lol.

ANything you can tell me, i appreciate. I know this is a lot of information, 
but that is how ignorant I am, i dont know what is important to tell and what 
is important to leave out... so i put it all in. In order. At least, it is 
more or less in order. lol.

Thank you for looking and telling me what you think,
With kindest regards,
Ceep ( i am a girl. I hope this note does not add to the veracity of the 
Harvard President's remark a few weeks ago that perhaps most women are not built 
for science...i hope that if someone would teach me, I could learn. And 
remember.)
