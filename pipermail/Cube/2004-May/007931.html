</I>&gt;<i> Listers,

</I>&gt;<i> I finaly afforded the money to upgrade my PM G4 Cube, but I'm still (a

</I>&gt;<i> willing to share some wise advice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do 1,35GHz upgraded PM G4 Cubes wake up from sleep properly?
</I>
I have had the PL 1.4 GHz for a few months now.
I have had no problems with wake from sleep.

&gt;<i> As I can't seem to find additional info on this, do we have to press
</I>&gt;<i> CUDA button before the first start up?
</I>
I am pretty sure that you do.

&gt;<i> I still have the need of (rarely) booting up in Mac OS 9 so, do the
</I>&gt;<i> firmware upgrade (provided by PL) works?
</I>
I have never booted into 9 on this machine, so I can't answer that.

&gt;<i> Is the fan provided by PL (noise) noticeable, or is it normal/discreet?
</I>
It is quiet. If I have any ambient noise in the room, I don't hear it. For
example, if my window is open (I don't have air conditioning), the noise
from outside (and I live on a mostly quiet street) drowns out the fan.

When I do hear it, it is a low annoyance fan, unlike most PC fans.

&gt;<i> And is there a way to put the fan working only above certain (risky)
</I>&gt;<i> temperature(s), or does it have to stay working all the time (while not
</I>&gt;<i> asleep)?
</I>
It is always on.

I may have a bad board or am stressing the cube with the PL 1.4, 120GB
Seagate 7200 drive and a GeForce IIMX, because sometimes the cube
unexpectadly locks up. It may be a SW issue, however, I don't really know.
Usually if it locks, it locks during heavy operations (often while using
Nikon Capture, which I originally thought was the cuplrit), but sometimes
it has locked up while completely idle.

Before I blame the upgrade card, however, I plan on reinstalling panther
to be sure I don't have an OS issue, and maybe even puttging the Rage128
back in.

Allan
