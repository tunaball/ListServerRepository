<PRE>Apple Displays Can Now Be Fixed Locally!
by Patrick Mchugh
(from smalldog.com Newsletter - Kibbles &amp; Bites)

In poking around the Apple website, we recently discovered that Small 
Dog Electronics can now order parts and support the repair of certain 
Apple LCDs. Previously, the only way that you could have had your Apple 
Display repaired was to dispatch it to the Apple repair facility. Now 
local service providers can fully repair the 17-inch Apple Studio 
Display, the 20-inch Apple Cinema Display, and the 23-inch Apple Cinema 
HD Display.

Limited parts can be ordered for other models of Apple displays, most 
notably the hinge and foot. We have had customers contact us to get 
these scarce parts, only to be disappointed that we could not order 
them. Having the ability to obtain these parts will free up a lot of 
displays that have been held together with duct tape or leaned against 
the wall. Before Apple Service Providers were allowed to order these 
parts, the only option for owners of these displays was to dispatch 
them to Apple at the flat rate repair charge.

Local service should allow for faster turnaround times and lower costs 
for most display repairs. Instead of having a flat rate, we will be 
order individual parts and replace them as needed.

Here's a link to a display taken apart.

Small Dog should have some parts laying about from broken, unfixable 
monitors as well.  Ask, maybe you'll get lucky.
