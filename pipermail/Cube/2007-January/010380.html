<PRE>Yeah just because it is coming up in VNC does not mean that it is
going to display. A certain part of the board could be damaged and the
rest could be fine but that does not help you any does it?? lol. OK So
you can pick a new graphics card for it cheep on ebay or something
this should fix your issue. I am thinking if the new card doers not
fix your issue you are going to have some issues and unless you know
exactly what you are doing with electronics and you have instruments
to look at the motherboard and the extender card to see what componets
that you have to replace then I think that you are out of luck and you
moght want to get a new Cube on ebay. The price of them have been
going up because they have been getting more rare as they get older. I
got mine just in time so that I did not have to pay a lot for it. I
think that I got a 500 MHz Cube with a gig of ram for like $329.00. I
got very lucky with this deal and I tryed to find something like this
for my grandfather and I could not. Good Luck!!!
