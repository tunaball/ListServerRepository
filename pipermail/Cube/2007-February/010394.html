I can't agree more. I ahve bought a number of CPU upgrade in the  
past, mostly were not for me. I'd say that  at least 1/4 of them  
arrived broken (!). It was either non-working level 3 cache, or one  
of the provessors not working on a dual-CPU upgrade. Not to mention  
the Powerlogix incident with sleep which is just not acceptable for me.

Bus is not that much of a problem for a regular day to day usage. I'm  
not doing any operations that are affected by a slower bus speed.

Of course, if one uses pure reason, it always is. But then again, if  
we did that we wouldn't own a Cube in the first place, right? :)
