&gt;<i> Hello List Members,
</I>&gt;<i> In case, you didn't notice, the lists at TheMacintoshGuy.com are  
</I>&gt;<i> back! ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many of you had noticed the lists slowing down over recent months  
</I>&gt;<i> and we'd seen some very long delays in trying to get mail processed.  
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the poor old XServe we were running on was having a  
</I>&gt;<i> really hard time keeping up. Our IT friends made some attempts to  
</I>&gt;<i> squeeze some life into the old server but as we dug into it, the  
</I>&gt;<i> poor machine just died. Perhaps years of 100% CPU activity wore the  
</I>&gt;<i> poor thing out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So instead of messing with things too much, we went out and got a  
</I>&gt;<i> new machine, and started completely from scratch. We now have a new  
</I>&gt;<i> server with 10.6 and 64-bit compile of all the server software.  
</I>&gt;<i> (Read below if you want more details.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the new server, we're able to put more things in place that  
</I>&gt;<i> will help revitalize this community of lists. We're also looking at  
</I>&gt;<i> some new lists (iPhone, MacTablet, etc.) that will help get us into  
</I>&gt;<i> current areas of interest. We'll let you know when those are live.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to thank you all for the community you've created and I look  
</I>&gt;<i> forward to seeing it grow. It really is a special thing that we have  
</I>&gt;<i> all created here together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're planning on keeping the lists very open with very little  
</I>&gt;<i> moderation as they have been for the last 10+ years. We appreciate  
</I>&gt;<i> everything you do to keep the lists helpful, on topic, PG, and fun  
</I>&gt;<i> to be a part of. We will work on doing a better job of communicating  
</I>&gt;<i> what is going on. Unfortunately, the email addresses for the lists  
</I>&gt;<i> have been around for a long time and are popular with spammers  
</I>&gt;<i> apparently. While we do a great job of preventing any of that from  
</I>&gt;<i> getting through to the lists, it does keep the admin accounts and  
</I>&gt;<i> server pretty full of junk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, take a minute to see what other lists you might want to be a  
</I>&gt;<i> part of and start a discussion there. I was just looking and it  
</I>&gt;<i> looks like we're approaching the 11th anniversary of our oldest list  
</I>&gt;<i> later this month.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="../../../../www.themacintoshguy.com/lists/index.html">http://www.themacintoshguy.com/lists/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And for those who didn't know, I'm Eric Prentice,  
</I>&gt;<i> themacintoshguy.com was a site I started in the mid 90s for my Mac  
</I>&gt;<i> consulting business. Since then, I started Dr. Bott LLC, &lt;<A HREF="http://www.drbott.net/">http://www.drbott.net/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a distributor of accessories for the Apple market and that takes  
</I>&gt;<i> the majority of my focus. Dr. Bott LLC is kind enough to host the  
</I>&gt;<i> listserver and lend IT expertise to keeping it running. Our hope is  
</I>&gt;<i> that the new server will be a better platform to keep things running  
</I>&gt;<i> smoothly. If you have something you think we need to know, a email  
</I>&gt;<i> to the list admin addresses are always a good idea, lately you can  
</I>&gt;<i> also find me on Twitter. &lt;<A HREF="http://twitter.com/tunaball">http://twitter.com/tunaball</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for reading all this and being a part of the lists!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eric
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are into technical details from our IT friends, read on...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The old machine really had trouble coping with many many files  
</I>&gt;<i> combined in a single HFS directory. We considered re-purposing some  
</I>&gt;<i> existing hardware but decided if we're going to put in the effort,  
</I>&gt;<i> we might as well start with some fast hardware and the latest  
</I>&gt;<i> versions of all the applicable software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This machine was loaded with 10.6.0 Snow Leopard (client). We went  
</I>&gt;<i> on to compile the current stable release of Mailman and configure  
</I>&gt;<i> Postfix. I'm excited to say that all the software components for the  
</I>&gt;<i> list server (Apache, Postfix, Python, Mailman) are running in native  
</I>&gt;<i> x86_64 mode. Woohoo!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> System load and response time on the new server is obviously orders  
</I>&gt;<i> of magnitude faster than the previous server, an Xserve G4. Snow  
</I>&gt;<i> Leopard is still a x.0 release, so we realize there are a few minor  
</I>&gt;<i> glitches, but we didn't run into anything that we could not work  
</I>&gt;<i> around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the problems we ran into:
</I>&gt;<i> * SoftRAID (we love these guys, but it doesn't seem stable yet on  
</I>&gt;<i> 10.6)
</I>&gt;<i> * SNMP (wonky responses on some standard monitoring attributes)
</I>&gt;<i> * Default configurations more secure (Apple has adjusted some of the  
</I>&gt;<i> default settings for some services, tending to be more secure then  
</I>&gt;<i> previous OS versions. That is generally good, but requires a little  
</I>&gt;<i> extra sleuthing if you plan to install and operate software as  
</I>&gt;<i> documented for installing on 10.4 or 10.5)
