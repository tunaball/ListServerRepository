<PRE>One of the big things you pay for on a Mac is the operating system.  To upgrade the usual windows XP to windows 2000 pro, will run you a couple of hundred bucks.  Actually, if you tried to purchase all of the functionality that you get with the Mac OS, it'd probably cost way more than the eMac.  You say you don't want all of that stuff anyway?  Great, don't buy a Mac.  But for the total system value, Macs are at least comparable, and in my opinion, by far the better value.
It's a real shame that Motorola refuses to upgrade the Power PC.  It makes the cost of fast G4s and G5s a lot higher, since these mostly come from IBM.   Of course one of the main reasons that the Windoz boxes have such a high clock rate is that they cheat.  They put this monster heatsink and fan right on the processor.  A typical Pentium might clock at say 800 MHz without any cooling.  But if you put a fan on it and cool the heck out of it, you can get 1.2 to 1.4 GHz.  Apple took the other approach, and designed a system that doesn't need all of this cooling.  They've really gone to great lengths to eliminate fan noise.  I only wish that the PC makers would at least try.
Bob.

Hmm, I built my own for 400$ and I can assure you it's not a piece o' 
crap, but if you're a mac zealot, I guess I'm waisting electrons;)

When one has kids, a mortgage to pay, utilities..etc, one becomes loyal 
to their wallet, trust me.
And people look at performance. The eMac is older technology, dog slow 
FSB, very little RAM and a CRT, when most people prefer an LCD.


  It would be a shame to degrade a Mac to meet this cheap a
&gt;<i> demand and it would certainly harm the rest of the lines pricing.  Apple 
</I>&gt;<i> does not sell junk - and that is one of the reasons they are succesful 
</I>&gt;<i> and we continue to buy at a premium (but is it a premium or is the IBM 
</I>&gt;<i> clone market just overly underpriced?).
</I>
Most of the components found in Macs are the same as in PC's. Granted, 
Macs have better power supplies, but essentially, the same parts are to 
be found on both platforms.
