<PRE>The absence of a headless iMac is a real problem in the product matrix. There are loads of PC users out there with an existing monitor who are  looking at upgrades but get a better 'deal' with a box only purchase. 

An iMac cube would be an excellent way to lure in the very price conscious segment. I don't know if Apple  ever do such a thing since it might eat into iMac sales, but if they're at all serious about the enterprise market this is what they need. A G5 tower is massive overkill for most home users and office workers.

Heck, they offered something silent like this I'd buy two!

OOPS!!

Golly, I was writing this at about 2 a.m. And I completely forgot about the
eMac!!

DUH!!

And for $799 it's got a LOT of nice features. A 1ghz G4. Built in 56k modem.
It's all there. It needs more memory though. But no wonder eMac owners are
happy.

Okay, but I've heard the world is clamoring for a 'headless' iMac, right?

Something BELOW an eMac or maybe about the same price.  The benefits would
be that you could hook up an existing monitor, and it would be somewhat user
upgradeable.  So the user could put in more ram, or a drive, like the
original CUBE.

Just a thought.  I bet that SJOBS STILL wants a CUBE in the family. He  just
has to offer one at a friendly price.  I love my cube and I think that
another one would be swell.

But, I don't think that anything exactly like the CUBE will ever come along.
