It depends which kind you have - I've done it with a Series 1 and it is 
pretty easy, you just have to install a network card and put a new 
kernel directly onto the IDE disk.  Info can be found all over the web 
on it.  www.9thtee.com isn't a bad place to start looking and they have 
various hardware kits to help you along.

Series 2 units are a bit more of a problem because the kernel's 
checksum is burned to a PROM in the TiVo, but it can still be done 
(usually by using the ability of a Linux kernel to bootstrap another 
kernel, through a method called Monte).  I haven't done this yet, but I 
plan to do so soon.  Details on how to do this are also all over the 
web, and gathered coherently together in the book _Hacking the TiVo_, 
by William Von Hagen (the Series 1 stuff is in there too).

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, since TiVo looks to be moving more towards licensing and
</I>&gt;<i> away from building hardware, it really isn't much of an answer for
</I>&gt;<i> Apple..
</I>
???

I don't see how this is a problem.  Half of the TiVos I've bought are 
made by TiVo, but half of them are made by Phillips.  My favorite TiVo, 
the DVD burning unit, is made by Phillips and does all of the stuff 
that a TiVo-made TiVo will do.  I don't see any reason Apple can't or 
won't carry other TiVo units in their stores.

But anyway, I just wanted to pass along what a cool combo the TiVo and 
the Mac, especially the near-silent cube,  are.
