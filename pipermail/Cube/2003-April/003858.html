That's fine, because I don't care. I was just commenting on how I've 
noticed the same spam that gnarlodious had, and laurie went out to 
gather whatever she could to get back at me for upsetting her in a 
previous mail...so I was trying to set it straight that *I* had never 
personally posted my email anywhere.

I agree with you though. SPAM sucks, but it's rampant, and near 
impossible to avoid these days. Sad.
