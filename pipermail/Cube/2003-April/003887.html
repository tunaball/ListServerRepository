<PRE>I have mixed feelings about Powerlogix.  You may recall that I had a 
cube that was smoked by a 1GHz upgrade.

On the one hand, I was very happy that they were willing to take my 
whole cube and make it &quot;just work.&quot;  I was deeply impressed that the 
company contacted me after my posting of my experience on this list. 
They replaced pretty much all of the components in the cube - including 
:<i>( a worse video card, but it did get back in working order.  I 
</I>appreciate that.

On the other hand, it took several months for the cube to get back to 
me.  It was very frustrating.

So I get the impression that they're a bunch of good guys who want to 
do well by their customers, but they are perhaps more than a little 
overworked.
