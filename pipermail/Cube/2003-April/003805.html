<PRE>Good luck - it does seem to sound like the USB issue that Apple just 
admitted to, and recently posted an KnowledgeBase article on.

I do understand and sympathize with what you're going through - really! 
  Even OS 9 for the user was not as easy as computing should be 
(otherwise your consulting firm wouldn't exist!).  But there are some 
scary things about OS 9 - the very same things that you speak to being 
easy do indeed make me shudder and are primative - no file permissions 
is an absurd lack of security, and all it would take for your kicking 
and screaming client to kick and squeal about not having file 
permissions would be to have a disgruntled worker delete everything on 
a disk, trashing valuable files, etc.. It just takes some thought to 
manage, and admittedly, can be a headache as well.  Good luck.

ps. there's a great log file tool that has a nice GUI on it - check out 
Log Master on versiontracker.com.  You can see all the nitty gritty log 
file entries with this, search on them in Google, groups.google.com, 
and even Apple KnowledgeBase articles to help you solve problems - and 
never have to open the Terminal/shell.
