<PRE>David, Alan, Rick, Eagle

Thanks guys. We're gonna drag the cube back to our home/office. Client 
is away for the weekend so we have until Sunday to &quot;fix&quot; it and return 
to her office (40 miles away - which is one BIG reason we were trying 
to NOT have to take it.)

We have several things to look at now and will post anything we find.

This machine was only having minor issues before the upgrade to 10.2.5. 
There is a directly connected Epson C82, keyboard &amp; mouse - only USB 
devices.

We are kicking and screaming into this &quot;weird&quot; UNIX world. Never wanted 
to have to do terminal, etc.....that's why we had Macs. Sorry, I know 
that Alan, etc consider us absolutely primitive with such an attitude, 
but from user standpoint - the 9 world WORKED! Sharing files across 
local networks was as simple as making a user and sharing a file with 
them. This same client goes ballistic when a staff person's machine 
tells her she doesn't have sufficient privileges to trash something, 
etc. Actually, I go ballistic about the same issues.

Thanks again for the prompt support.
Brenda
