<PRE>I dont know about the worse engineering...
The DCDC card and the Video bay of the cube are pretty horrible
designs, electrically and thermally. Some of the SFF PC's are using 
heatpipes to move
the heat from a full speed P4 to an 80mm radiator and fan, replace the 
genero
fan with a Verax or Pabst, and there you go, quiet PC... Not to mention they
also support full high CD drives, so any and all burners are available 
to you.

Now of course the cube aesthetics arent there in the SFF's but they are 
darn close.
All they need is a decent OS, maybe the next version of Linux might work 
there,
or if MS can really deliver a new OS design instead of rehashing the 
Windows 95
interface over and over. Stability wise, MS is pretty close with Win 
2000/3 , I run it
on a work machine and it's as stable as OSX 10.2 on my Cube. I run games
and watch mpegs/divx's, and some heavy CAD apps, so it's not like the 
machine
loafs about like most home systems.

Once again, Apple leads the pack in design, but gives up too quickly and 
lets
them catch up. They had something with the Cube and Newton, but didnt
stick with the plan. Lets hope their play into the entertainment field 
pans out
and they can lead the market for music and video commerce over the net.
Expect a move from Redmond, the money's too big for them to let Apple have
this alone.
