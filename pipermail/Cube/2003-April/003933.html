<PRE>Hi J.C.

So, let me get this straight: you are burning 4x DVD's in the MCE 
Superdrive (which can only burn at max 1x) and that seems to give you 
better compatibility with your home player? Interesting, as I've had no 
luck sofar in using any of the DVD's I burnt with my MCE Superdrive in 
my home DVD player (Verbatim, Nashua, Apple (2x)). Possibly related to 
my home DVD player. Anyway, I have a couple of other media to try but I 
think I add the Apple 4x media in the equation...

cheers,
Rob
