$.99 cents was a good price point for me. I just one-clicked my way through
$20 worth of tunes from 15+ albums that I had no interest in buying as full
albums. Although I have downloaded some of those tunes for free from various
file sharing networks previously, the quality on most of them was lousy. I'm
happy to pay a buck a song for ONLY the songs I actually want in good
quality.

I'm a happy camper for now. Not even wanting to upgrade to a new iPod :)
(being the early adapter I am known to be, I still have my original 5gb
iPod). Maybe in a few months I'll buy a new one and relegate the 5gb to
hubby for his exclusive use.

Laurie
