I bought a 2 megapixel Canon PowerShot A60 two weeks ago -- my first 
digital camera.  The A60 costs around $250 so it's not too expensive 
but not too cheap either.  I have been completely impressed with the 
pictures I have taken so far -- feel free to take a look at 
<A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/eagle243/digicam/">http://homepage.mac.com/eagle243/digicam/</A> - and keep checking because 
I'll be adding more pics that I want to publish.  In 2 weeks I have 
taken well over 150 pictures, probably near 200.  If 2 megapixel isn't 
enough for you, Canon makes a $350-$400 3 megapixel version of the 
camera, the A70.

I bought the A60 because it can take additional lenses with an adapter, 
and because it has manual shutter, aperture, and focus modes, and 
because it has a continuous drive settings in which takes up to six 
frames @ 2.6 frames per second.  I wanted a camera whose pictures I 
could print, but I didn't want to spend piles of money to be able to 
print greater than 8x10, as I will likely never do that.

I'm not sure about the B&amp;W question but you can convert a color image 
to black and white with iPhoto or Photoshop.  A friend of mine has had 
great success doing that; his 3-year-old daughter is model-beautiful, 
and that's obvious in the pics he has converted to B&amp;W.

I was looking into printers recently, and I'll probably replace my HP 
with a Canon 850 or greater, next time my ink cartridges need to be 
replaced.

&gt;<i> a fast scanner color dpi high, with slide, neg scanner--,

I have a Canon LiDE 30 and have been impressed with it, but it probably 
won't fit your needs.

Good luck!
