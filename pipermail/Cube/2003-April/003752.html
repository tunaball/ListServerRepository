<PRE>Applications are always located here, /Applications, unless you put 
them somewhere else.  Documents are always in your home directory, 
/Users/$username/Documents, or ~/Documents, there are no more 
extensions, but there are kernel extensions - confusing, now that I 
typed that, and Control Panes just have a fancy new name - System 
Preferences, which is always found in the Apple Menu, and in the 
/Applications menu.

The most startling thing I've noticed about OS X (since loading 10.slow 
on my 5/2001 ibook) is there does not seem to be an easy way to access 
your applications without navigating to them with the Finder, which is 
kind of silly.  Sure, you can place them in your Dock individually, or 
even drag the Applications folder to the Dock as well, and click-hold 
it until the directory listing comes up (but that has a delay while the 
list is loaded into RAM), but that is very unintuitive, IMO.  Very much 
so.  I mean, it didn't take me a second to drag the apps folder to my 
dock personally, but I was just confounded that there isn't an entry 
called Applications off the Apple menu - not that I want to mimic the 
Start menu or anything - but you have to admit that the Start menu 
thing makes sense once trained on always going there for your apps - 
KDE mimics this, as does GNOME.  Perhaps there's a reason for that.  
(yeah, i know i can /buy/ fruit menu - i don't want to, and shouldn't 
need to).

I'd recommend a good book, OS X:  The Missing Manual by David Pogue.  
It's very well written for exactly the kinds of questions you have.  I 
regret buying my copy as I found it to be too elementary, but I still 
recognize the quality of the book, and its contents.
