<PRE>I have that same printer, and getting the driver software to work is a pain.
However, once it does work, it's great.

If you're running the newer system software, you HAVE to upgrade to a later
version of the driver.  I had real problems with this - printing gibberish -
until I used the OLD version to do a full uninstall of all HP products on my
system.  Then I installed the new driver software, and everything has worked
like a dream since.  It's a great all-in-one, once you can get it working,
and it IS worth the effort, although only just.

I love the SONY Cybershot DSC P9 camera - very small, very beautiful, and
takes pretty good 4MP pictures.  They look photographic rather than
video-ish.  Everything works seamlessly with iPhoto.

</I>&gt;<i> YO Eagle, Great shots of the dog peeking out from couch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SCANNER, COPIER, PRINTER:
</I>&gt;<i> I have an HP 750 all in one. Slim small foot print, capable of fine
</I>&gt;<i> prints,
</I>&gt;<i> scans, and copies, but the driver software sucks. I am exploring switching
</I>&gt;<i> to the new $200 Epson 3-in-1.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CAMERA:
</I>&gt;<i> Have owned a Fuji MX1700 for 3 years - Only 1.5 mega pixels, but I love
</I>&gt;<i> it!
</I>&gt;<i> Why? Pocket-able, 3X optical zoom, but mainly, it has a LARGE LCD screen
</I>&gt;<i> making it so easy to compose. None of the newer cameras have a comparable
</I>&gt;<i> sized screen. So I just purchased for my wife, from eBay, a nearly new
</I>&gt;<i> Fuji
</I>&gt;<i> MX 4700 for $228.   Effectively 2.5 mp. Looks exactly like the 1700, with
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> beautiful pocket size design and HUGE screen, and video too. Terrific
</I>&gt;<i> camera. Nothing like it out there for this money.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Footnote:
</I>&gt;<i> I also just purchased a NIKON COOL-PIX 4500 touted for its outstanding
</I>&gt;<i> macro
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities for use in my dental office. Disappointingly overrated.
</I>&gt;<i> Ridiculously tiny screen, hard to compose. Not quite pocket size, and when
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> want to grab a shot, I go for the Fuji every time. I've read the manual
</I>&gt;<i> cover to cover several times, bought a ring light and still haven't
</I>&gt;<i> figured
</I>&gt;<i> out the proper combination of settings to get a quick and sharp photo of
</I>&gt;<i> smiles and teeth. If anyone (preferably a dentist) has advice on this
</I>&gt;<i> machine, let me know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Tom Kuhn

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I bought a 2 megapixel Canon PowerShot A60 two weeks ago -- my first

</I>&gt;<i> camera. The A60 costs around $250 so it's not too expensive but not too

</I>&gt;<i> taken so far -- feel free to take a look at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/eagle243/digicam/">http://homepage.mac.com/eagle243/digicam/</A> - and keep checking because I'll
</I>&gt;<i> be adding more pics that I want to publish. In 2 weeks I have taken well
</I>&gt;<i> over 150 pictures, probably near 200. If 2 megapixel isn't enough for you,
</I>&gt;<i> Canon makes a $350-$400 3 megapixel version of the camera, the A70.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I bought the A60 because it can take additional lenses with an adapter,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> because it has manual shutter, aperture, and focus modes, and because it
</I>&gt;<i> has
</I>&gt;<i> a continuous drive settings in which takes up to six frames @ 2.6 frames
</I>&gt;<i> per
</I>&gt;<i> second. I wanted a camera whose pictures I could print, but I didn't want
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> spend piles of money to be able to print greater than 8x10, as I will
</I>&gt;<i> likely
</I>&gt;<i> never do that.
