<PRE>YO Eagle, Great shots of the dog peeking out from couch.

SCANNER, COPIER, PRINTER:
I have an HP 750 all in one. Slim small foot print, capable of fine prints,
scans, and copies, but the driver software sucks. I am exploring switching
to the new $200 Epson 3-in-1.

CAMERA:
Have owned a Fuji MX1700 for 3 years - Only 1.5 mega pixels, but I love it!
Why? Pocket-able, 3X optical zoom, but mainly, it has a LARGE LCD screen
making it so easy to compose. None of the newer cameras have a comparable
sized screen. So I just purchased for my wife, from eBay, a nearly new Fuji
MX 4700 for $228.   Effectively 2.5 mp. Looks exactly like the 1700, with a
beautiful pocket size design and HUGE screen, and video too. Terrific
camera. Nothing like it out there for this money.

Footnote:
I also just purchased a NIKON COOL-PIX 4500 touted for its outstanding macro
capabilities for use in my dental office. Disappointingly overrated.
Ridiculously tiny screen, hard to compose. Not quite pocket size, and when I
want to grab a shot, I go for the Fuji every time. I've read the manual
cover to cover several times, bought a ring light and still haven't figured
out the proper combination of settings to get a quick and sharp photo of
smiles and teeth. If anyone (preferably a dentist) has advice on this
machine, let me know.

Many Thanks,
Tom Kuhn

You guys are always helpful...I hope you can help me agani...
Does anyone here who works with photography or images have a dream team idea
of printer, scanner and digi camera that I can buy at COMPUSA or through
Apple catologs, or other apple supplier? For not a billion dollars, but not
cheapo-doesn't-look-good price either. I guess, best qulaity for reasonable
money.

I bought a 2 megapixel Canon PowerShot A60 two weeks ago -- my first digital
camera. The A60 costs around $250 so it's not too expensive but not too
cheap either. I have been completely impressed with the pictures I have
taken so far -- feel free to take a look at
<A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/eagle243/digicam/">http://homepage.mac.com/eagle243/digicam/</A> - and keep checking because I'll
be adding more pics that I want to publish. In 2 weeks I have taken well
over 150 pictures, probably near 200. If 2 megapixel isn't enough for you,
Canon makes a $350-$400 3 megapixel version of the camera, the A70.

I bought the A60 because it can take additional lenses with an adapter, and
because it has manual shutter, aperture, and focus modes, and because it has
a continuous drive settings in which takes up to six frames @ 2.6 frames per
second. I wanted a camera whose pictures I could print, but I didn't want to
spend piles of money to be able to print greater than 8x10, as I will likely
never do that.
