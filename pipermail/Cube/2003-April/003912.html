<PRE>Dear beloved Cube owners.

It is now over a day and a half since Robert Jagitsch said he would get an
answer on this from their Tech-support people at Waypoint, namely Jason.

Jason and I have had several conversations in the interim, although nothing
more in terms of new information has been made available.  He has gone out
of his way to tell me EXACTLY what he does and does not know, as to what is
happening with my card. i.e.

The new cards are being produced and are promised for delivery back to
Powerlogix &quot;shortly&quot;, hopefully within a week and a half, but no exact date
has been given to him.  Therefore none to me.

I have sent Robert three further emails, none have which have been responded
to by Robert...


Much as I want to upgrade my cube (as I originally did, two months ago...)
I am starting to get rather worried that:-

1] Powerlogix are not really that interested in their customers.
2] That powerlogix and Waypoint are getting into a shouting match as to
who's fault it is.

There is no fault here, just a situation that has developed that needs
resolution.
Squabbling over who the finger should be pointed at does not rectify the
problem.

I am at a loss to see why the president of a company would be more
interested in finding fault with the system/others, than just sorting out
the problem.

Does that mean ergo, that the customers come last and the internal finger
pointing/blame is more important?

I will keep everyone posted as to any developments.

In the meantime, if this is a upgrade path that you are considering, it may
be prudent to reconsider doing it until such issues as this and all the
other cube owners who are in the same boat have been resolved.

Kindest regards


John Guy
