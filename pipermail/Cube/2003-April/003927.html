I am sure he has plenty of things to do, including sending numerous
responses back to Way point shifting the blame to them.

There is no &quot;kicking&quot; to be done, there is no need, I am not after blood
just a solution.

My point was that numerous emails, with me as the as the subject, have been
flying around, trying to find out who is at fault, there is no need for a
blame culture here or at any time for that matter.  Just to learn from
mistakes, develop the process's internally and get the customer problem
resolved.

In addition, in the other mails that I didn't post to the forum ( because
that could be perceived as being OTT, or bludgeoning as I think you put it)
none of the points/questions I raised directly to Robert have had any
response...
