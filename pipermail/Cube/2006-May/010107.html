<PRE>My cube has the same problem. There was a thread on this subject a  
few months ago, and I made a clipping of the relevant text. Hope this  
will help you. Maybe worthwile to try this solution first.

I just did it. Please read my post from the other thread:

&quot;Ok... thanks for the tips. However I took the rocky road and opened  
the drive, and I am glad I did, because I could see why simply  
injecting a Q-tip, a cloth-covered disc or an isopropanol-wet disc  
alone can't work, if it doesn't even completely fuck your drive up.

Opening was easier than I thought. Just 4 screws, two tiny little  
ones on the sides and two slightly bigger ones at the end where the  
board sits. You carefully unplug the board and then lift off the  
metal cover and push it to the side off the lashes at the end. Inside  
you'll see the rubber roll that transports the CD out of the drive.  
By removing two tiny springs (use a needle) you can even remove a  
black plastic mechanism, that covers a third of the inside incl. the  
roll. What you also see - and that's why cleaning the roll alone  
cannot work - is the drive of that roll, performed by two wheels and  
a rubber band between them. You gotta clean that too! I even believe  
that must be the more important factor in making the drive eject again.

I also discovered several little dust mice in different parts of the  
drive, which, while at it, I simply blew out and wiped off with a  
soft brush. Of course I also thorougly cleaned the rubber roll and  
while doing it I could actually feel how it was regaining grip. I  
used Q-tips and alcohol. So, that was it! Reassemble everything and  
you have a good-as-new optical drive. Make sure the edges of the open  
side of the drive are all straight before putting it back into your  
Cube, because from handling the box you may have deformed it a bit.

I can't believe they didn't want to do it in Apple's official repair  
shop, claiming it isn't worth the effort. I would estimate the time  
needed to do the cleaning, including taking the drive in and out of  
the computer, at not more than 30 minutes, even much less if you are  
a little experienced. This should still be cheaper than a new drive,  
even if you pay yourself a NASA computer specialist type of fee.&quot;

I recently did this as well but instead of using alcohol I used a RC  
car rubber tire compound thing..... wow that's technical, it's  
basically a liquid that smells like peppermint that makes the rubber  
much softer and grippy-er, I soaked the rubber band in it for about  
4-5 minutes and coated and recoated the larger roller about 2-3 times  
and you could feel the rubber realllyyyy had bite to it after that,  
also I slightly loosened on that upper plastic shell the spring  
tension needed to push those two white &quot;bars&quot; outta the way? so the  
CD didn't have to fight so hard to push its self through them to get  
in and out and tightened a bit the spring that pulled that black  
plastic piece down towards the rubber ejector. All in all it spits  
them out as if it was a lil kid being force fed broccoli

Steak Knives, like duct tape for a Cube.
