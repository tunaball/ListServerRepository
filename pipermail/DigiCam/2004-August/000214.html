<PRE>Mark,
    I just got back from visiting my daughter in Honduras. I took my 
Canon Optura 20. I was there for 7 days but only in the rainforest for 
2 or 3. I had it suspended from my neck in a large ziplock bag while 
zipping around on cables in the canopy and hiking. Besides the humidity 
of the cloud forest it also rained on us. I did get a &quot;remove the 
cassette&quot; warning based on &quot;condensation has been detected in the 
camera&quot; in spite of the  bag. Later that day we went into a city to a 
hotel with air conditioning. I jacked up the air and opened the camera 
and it dried right out. I used it that night. While the ziplock bag 
didn't help with condensation, I do think it makes sense for protection 
against rain. Just poke a small hole in the bottom of the bag and 
thread your neck strap through. Maybe add a little duct tape. Now the 
zipper is at the bottom and can be securely sealed and easily opened to 
use the camera.  My daughter has been there for 2 years in the Peace 
Corps and her advice was to forego raingear and just bring a hat since 
when it rains there raingear is a joke. You're just going to be wet. 
The baggie might at least help the camera.

Jim
