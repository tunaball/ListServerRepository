<PRE>Thanks Shirley for all the great info. I prefer to not get a flatbed. I have
an Epson and did not like the results the one time I tried it. I do like it
for scanning photos though. I don't have near as many as you do to scan at
this time, but if it goes good, I have more slides and hundreds if not
thousands of negatives from years ago, but I am pretty particular and want
the best or darn near the best. I have been looking at Nikon 8000ED with a
$500 rebate right now, Minolta, Canoscan, and PrimeFilm. Prices range from
$1850 to less than $600 and yes, I definately want the ICE software. And I
already have a DVD burner and it is great for backing up. I prefer not to
spend more than $1000. I may go ahead and try one of the lens attachments on
the Digital Rebel. My quick search didn't tell which lens it recommended,
but I think I recall that it wanted something in the medium portrait focal
length-around 75 to 120mm-so I guess that one would have to multiply that by
1.6. I got the 55 to 200 AFS lens with the camera in addition to the 18-55,
so I should be covered.

Take care!

</I>&gt;<i> How good are the slides? How many is a boatload? How good does the scan
</I>&gt;<i> have to be?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For perfectly exposed slides, you can get by with something less
</I>&gt;<i> expensive. If they are in poor shape, you probably want a scanner with
</I>&gt;<i> Digital ICE (you want both color correction and noise control). Also
</I>&gt;<i> research Density - possibly more important than dpi.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can go with the expensive dedicated film scanner (such as Nikon
</I>&gt;<i> Coolscans, probably the best), a good flatbed with transparancy adapter
</I>&gt;<i> (such as Epson Perfection), or the add-on to a digital camera. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know how you control lighting with that, however.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have the Nikon Coolscan 4000 ED which cost $1700 a couple years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> They are still available for $1200-something minus a $200 rebate.
</I>&gt;<i> (That's list from Nikon's site). That one has FireWire. There is a less
</I>&gt;<i> expensive model that uses USB and it also has a $200 rebate. One of the
</I>&gt;<i> Mac magazines reported that the FireWire was no faster than the USB
</I>&gt;<i> when they were reviewed a couple years ago. Recently Nikon announced a
</I>&gt;<i> new series of Coolscans that replace those. They are described as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;affordable&quot; and they MIGHT be better than the older ones. I saw a
</I>&gt;<i> price of $750 for the one that I think replaces mine. Unfortunately,
</I>&gt;<i> the new ones use USB 2.0 instead of FireWire.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've done over 4000 slides and over 2000 negatives. The slides were in
</I>&gt;<i> OS 9. The negatives and some new slides I'm doing are in OS X.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, using their software on OS X, I've hit some problems.
</I>&gt;<i> There will be random 4-pixel bands, side-by-side that are swapped. I
</I>&gt;<i> was able to select each, put them on separate layers and then move them
</I>&gt;<i> back into their correct positions. This mostly fixed the glitch, but
</I>&gt;<i> that is time-consuming and doesn't always put it back together right.
</I>&gt;<i> After downloading Lasersoft's Silverfast scanning software, I convinced
</I>&gt;<i> myself that the problem is not heat-related as tech support said, but
</I>&gt;<i> rather their software. Since I didn't notice this on the earlier slides
</I>&gt;<i> done on OS 9, I think they just have problems adapting to OS X. I also
</I>&gt;<i> didn't notice it with the negatives. I mainly saw it when zoomed in to
</I>&gt;<i> fix red eye. They also have a memory leak and there is no estimated
</I>&gt;<i> time frame to fix it. Again, I believe this is only on OS X (and of
</I>&gt;<i> course, only with Nikon's software).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I needed to scan some larger negatives, so I got the Epson Perfection
</I>&gt;<i> 2450. It does a pretty good job and had I never seen the Nikon scans, I
</I>&gt;<i> would have been happy with those. You can scan up to 4 at a time that
</I>&gt;<i> way, but I'd think you'd better have lots and lots of RAM. I don't even
</I>&gt;<i> try that with 750 MB of RAM, while scanning at 2000 dpi.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then there is disk space. Scanning at 2000 dpi and setting Photoshop to
</I>&gt;<i> NOT save that flattened extra copy of the image, I could only get about
</I>&gt;<i> 21 slides on one CD. Storing hundreds of CDs was not attractive, so I
</I>&gt;<i> bought a DVD burner which holds about 7 times that many images.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since the digital camera attachment is going to be the cheapest route,
</I>&gt;<i> I'd try that first and see if you can live with the results. You
</I>&gt;<i> probably aren't out that much if you decide to get something better. It
</I>&gt;<i> will certainly be the fastest way to capture them too. Using the color
</I>&gt;<i> correction (ROC) and noise control (GEM), scans took about 3 minutes on
</I>&gt;<i> a dual 1.42 G4. On a slower iMac G3 when I started, they took about 6
</I>&gt;<i> minutes. What is the recommended lens for that attachment? (I have the
</I>&gt;<i> Digital Rebel too.)
