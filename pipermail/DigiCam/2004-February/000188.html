<PRE>One other piece of the pie is how does the company treat the customer. 
I have no information about Minolta, but as an owner of a Nikon 5000, 
similar but older model, I have been very unhappy with Nikon. They 
remind me of my dealings with Sony on a video camera. I will think long 
and hard before I buy another camera from either of them. I think their 
attitude is -- we have a reputation and we don't have to be bothered 
with customer service. Fortunately I have been very happy with the 
camera.
