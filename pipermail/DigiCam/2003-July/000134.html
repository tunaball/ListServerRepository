<PRE>TIA, have a look at www.donsphoto.com

They are based out of Winnipeg MB, with an excellent professional division
that we have been dealing with for years.  They have both online purchasing
and photofinishing.  The shift to digital is keeping them quite occupied.
Shipping varies between $15-50 depending upon your total purchase.

Dave

Subject: [DigiCam] Canadian 'book and digital camera purchases


A Canadian acquaintance of mine, a photojournalist, has just had a good 
deal of her equipment stolen while in South Africa where she's staying 
till Monday.

She wants to take this opportunity to enter the digital era. She would 
like to get online either while still in SA or upon arriving back in 
Canada (I don't know if it makes a difference to an online retailer 
what country the order is placed from) and order stuff to be shipped to 
her address in Canada.

She is looking for new, refurbished or used equipment as follows:

1) iBook or PowerBook with cd burner

2) Nikon digital slr--D1 or D1X or D1H (or possibly one of the Kodak or 
Fuji dslrs that use the Nikon mount).

I've heard some online retailers charge prices that are higher than the 
exchange rate would indicate and high shipping costs for Canadian 
orders. Can those of you who are of Canadian residence recommend online 
retailers that have fair prices and shipping and warranties for 
Canadian orders. She has to act quickly because having this equipment 
is essential to her livelihood. I'm posting this so that she can 
benefit from the research and experience you already have.

TIA
