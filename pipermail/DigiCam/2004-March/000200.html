(I'm really only familiar with the Canon range so I can't comment on 
the Nikon or Olympus)

Most of the Canon Powershot camera's also use an auto-iso mode when 
set to the &quot;Auto&quot; mode but I believe they will vary the ISO between 
50 and 150 and at those settings there is probably not much noise - 
although I suspect you could notice the difference between 50 and 150.


Did you end up looking at the detailed reviews on dpreview.com or 
imaging-resource? Imaging-resource has some standard test shots which 
will show the tendency of each camera to get skin tones wrong. He 
also does a lot of low-light testing which sounds like it might be of 
interest. DPreview usually does noise tests which might be 
interesting.

Is the Canon G3 or G5 in your price range? Might be worth considering 
esp if you think about adding an external flash in the future. My 
Dad's G3 takes excellent photos but the with Canon speedlight on top 
they are so much better - the ability to bounce the flash off the 
ceiling makes all the difference  - much more than just &quot;nice&quot; :). 
It recharges very quickly but I think it was reasonably expensive. 
The lens on the G3/G5 is much faster than the A80 or S-series 
Powershots.
