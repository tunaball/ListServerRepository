I have a Dimage 7i and so would like to add to Fred's comments.

&gt;<i> Earlier this year I was considering a Nikon Coolpix 5700 digital 
</I>&gt;<i> camera.  But after much research, I decided to purchase a Minolta 
</I>&gt;<i> DiMage 7Hi for the following reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The Minolta zooms from 28-200 mm (by 35mm standards).  The Nikon 
</I>&gt;<i> zooms a bit higher, but needs an expensive add on lens to get down to 
</I>&gt;<i> a wide angle 28mm.  The Minolta zoom is the same as that on my Minolta 
</I>&gt;<i> 35mm, but is done without the heavy extra zoom lens that I have on the 
</I>&gt;<i> 35.
</I>
An additional disadvantage to a wide angle attachment besides cost and 
weight is that it could block the built in flash on some cameras or the 
built in flash might not have sufficient angle of coverage.

The extra few millimeters of wide angle offered by the 7Hi make a big 
difference in actual picture taking situations. It is a big help for 
group shots, interiors, scenics or for a more intimate closer-in look.

&gt;<i> 3. The Minolta can take filters (like for protecting the lens), but 
</I>&gt;<i> the Nikon cannot accommodate a filter.
</I>
Filters or polarizers for the 7Hi need to be thin mount to avoid 
vignetting at wide angles. Not a problem, but worth mentioning.

&gt;<i> I have been totally satisfied with the Minolta DiMage 7Hi
</I>
I have been quite pleased with the 7i but I understand that the newer 
Dimage A1 has a quicker auto focus, predictive follow focus, faster 
shutter response, an anti-shake feature for handheld shots at slow 
shutter speeds, and is generally more refined than the 7i or 7Hi. Oh, 
and the A1's battery pack lasts longer than the 7Hi; as I recall for, 
the A1, Minolta switched fro NiMH to LiON (or something like that). For 
my 7i, I stopped using 4 rechargeable AA NiMH batteries that would be 
inserted in the camera and instead use an small external battery pack, 
the Mizco DPS 9000 rechargeable. I believe it costs between 40 and 60 
USD. I got it on closeout at BestBuy for USD 20. I think Ritz/Wolf 
Camera are carrying it now. It comes with a handful of different power 
cords that allow it to be used with a huge number of different digital 
camera brands and models.

&gt;<i> I ordered the Minolta from 17th Street Photo in NYC.  Their price was 
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat higher than others, but this place had very high ratings (on 
</I>&gt;<i> Bizrate.com) from many who ordered from them.  And they sell only US 
</I>&gt;<i> warranted products, no &quot;grey&quot; stuff.  Many of those with lower prices 
</I>&gt;<i> had terrible consumer ratings.
</I>
When I lived in NYC in the 70s and 80s I dealt regularly with B+H 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.bhphotovideo.com">http://www.bhphotovideo.com</A>&gt; and I believe they still maintain their 
reputation. They sell grey stuff but they clearly distinguish between 
imported and US warranty. I only ever bought US warranty from them; it 
is worth the small price difference.
