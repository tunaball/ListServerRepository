Thanks to all who replied. I looked more closely at the reviews and 
downloaded some sample images taken with the Olympus C 750 UZ from 
steves-digicams. For some reason it had not occurred to me that the 
images posted on the review sites would be the actual camera-produced 
files (duh). I printed a couple full frame 8&quot;x10&quot; which looked great, 
and then cropped a horizontal to vertical (as being a typical crop) and 
printed it to 8&quot;x10&quot; again and it still looked great. I think I will 
buy it from a local store that permits 7 day exchanges, just in case. I 
can think of two things that might put off a first time digital camera 
user:
1) the electronic viewfinder
2) the lack of a focus assist light
Or my step-son might decide he wants something more pocketable.
This camera gift falls into that special gift category that is  above 
expectations and is intended to last many years, as opposed to the 
usual shirt, sweater or tie, so I want it to be a good fit.
