You'll find the same type of exhaustive/exhausting discussion about 
printers on the &quot;Printing&quot; forum at DPReview. Beware that it might 
just get you even more confused!

 From reading those forums it seems like print quality is comparable 
between the best Canon/Epson/HP printers but there are big 
differences in consumable (ie ink) cost and print longevity. Canon is 
the cheapest to run while HP is (much) more expensive but has better 
print longevity. Epson is in the in middle of both counts.

Just two more comments on printers. First, imaging-resource just 
posted a review on the new HP 7660 (I think the number is right). 
This looks to be a very good printer - but you will pay a lot more in 
ink. Second, if you can you might compare the output from a Canon 
4-ink printer with 2-picolitre droplets (ie i560 or i865) to the 
i965. Mnay people find that that the difference between them is not 
worth the extra cost of the i950/i965 - some even prefer the output 
from the 4-ink printers.

(Personally I did the comparison and settled on a 4-ink printers. In 
fact I did a usage/cost estimate and went for the i450 - same print 
quality as the i850, much cheaper upfront but more on ink (because it 
doesn't have the individual cartridges) - but I would have to print 
about 1200 6x4 pictures before the difference in upfront costs was 
made up).
