<PRE>I can only say that I've enjoyed the Coolpix 995 for a couple years. I 
was primarily interested in its macro capabilities. I thought about 
moving up to the 5700, but just didn't think it was that much more 
camera. When the Canon Digital Rebel was introduced, (SLR for $1000 
with lens), it was obvious that this was the next step for me.

For what you want to do, the 5700 is more than adequate. Prices of all 
serious point and shoot digitals like the 5700 should drop as a result 
of the Rebel. Some have even questioned if there is a market for such 
cameras anymore.

To get a really good idea of what the 5700 is like from owners, visit 
the forums on dpreview. On the Digital Rebel forum, people post their 
pictures and talk openly about every little feature. You can learn a 
lot about what people like or do not like about their cameras on those 
forums.

Can't help with the printer. I've stuck with Epson since I first 
started printing photos, though I rarely print them anyway. They look 
so much better on the monitor that I prefer slide shows with panning 
and zooming into the photo and a musical background.
