Wow, I haven't seen a post to this list for a long time.


It sounds like an unfortunate coincidence that only a Kodak repair
person could resolve. I'm not familiar with Kodak cameras so I don't
know how old it is, but I suppose that if it was still under warranty,
you would have already taken it for service?


Have you tried posting this on the Kodak forum at dpreview?
