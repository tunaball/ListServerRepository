Thank you all for your replies. You really helped me with my decision. 
I tried out the Canon PowerShot A60 for several days. Though the A60 is 
a fine little point and shoot picture taker I traded it in. The A60 
sold me on the delight of digital still cameras but I missed 
professional slr style controls. More than that, I missed wide angle 
zoom. The wide angle zoom requirement (28mm equiv) narrowed my choices 
to about 4 cameras and almost quadrupled the price. I bought the 
Minolta Dimage 7i (the 7Hi was tempting but a $100 instant rebate on 
the 7i made the 7Hi $400 more and it just doesn't have $400 worth of 
additional features--not sure it has $300 worth of additional 
features--now that I've bought the 7i the price on the 7Hi will drop 
real soon). I like the 28-200 range, the slr style controls. Pop the 
flash up and its on, pop it down and its off. And of course, the Dimage 
is higher resolution. I don't know how its image quality compares with 
other cameras in its class.

I'm still twitching from spending so much money but I'll keep the 
camera a long time and get good use out of it.
