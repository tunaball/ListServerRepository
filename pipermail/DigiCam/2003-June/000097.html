<PRE>Back to the well once again...

Being a bit of a tightwad, and living in Europe, the land of the 20% sales
tax and monster markups, I'm (still) looking for a cheapish consumer digital
camera priced under $300.

Any and all recommendations much appreciated.

The contenders:

1) HP Photosmart 720 (3MP and 3x optical zoom), got good reviews at Steve's
Digicams: last seen priced around 250 euros (+ tax), but has been phased out

2) HP Photosmart 735 (same specs): replacement for 720, no reviews online
yet; priced even cheaper than the 720 at around 220 euros

3) Coolpix 885: obviously a cut above the HP, at least according to the
reviews: priced around 290 euros (+ tax) and hard to find

4) Kodak 4330 (3MP and 3x optical), good reviews: priced around 290 euros +
tax


If the HP 720 were still available I might spring for it, as it's had good
reviews and is a cheapish few-frills point and shoot with good specs. The
last few stores that still sell it have seriously marked it up from its last
selling price of around 250 euros, as they're now asking 300+.

The 735 is super cheap and comes with a 2 year HP warranty, but I haven't
seen any pro reviews on it yet. HP may have cut corners on quality compared
to the 720 to price it that low.

The Coolpix and Kodak have had good reviews, though the price reflects that.


I'd be using the camera for pictures of the kids to send to the grandparents
(blah*****! how cliched can you get?!) The idea is to upload the pics to a
digital photo shop located near the grandparents, where they could go in and
pick up the photos when ready.

Computers: Pismo powerbook with 9.2.2 and 10.2.6, G4/350 Sawtooth with same
OS.
