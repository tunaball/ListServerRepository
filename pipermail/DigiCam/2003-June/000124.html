<PRE>I have had two cards of the many cards I have used and re-used become 
&quot;corrupted&quot;
By corrupted, I mean that the cards previously were working, contained 
images, which had been viewed and deleted on the computer, and used 
again, in the same manner, until such time as I would put one of the 
cards in the computer, and viola, it would say, Unreadable, do you want 
to format this disk [smart media card]?

So the card was working well before the corruption. Yes, and the second 
time it occurred was at a SmartDisk booth at PhotoShop World 2002, when 
man whose name I will not say was trying to demonstrate the ability of 
the dual SmartDisk reader he was selling, to read my card, which I 
pulled out of the camera and handed to him. Mind you, this was a brand 
new disk with only a ton of images on it from the PhotoShop World 
exposition, and I had just taken a photo at his booth, so when he could 
not get it to work, because of whatever?, he gave me back the card, and 
I continued to take photos. When I got home, to put the card into my 
reader to download the images, I got the message, &quot;unreadable, do you 
want to format this disk?&quot; So I emailed him three times, but he ignored 
my email. I blamed the malfunction, of course on his reader. What do 
you think. I normally use a Lexar reader, and i believe that I was 
using a 32 mb Kingston smartcard. Do you think that could be the 
problem? Various reader incompatibilities. These guy who was at the 
booth, was not a demonstrator, but rather a computer guy from Smart 
Disk, who was filling in for the Demonstrator of their products.
I have thought of going to Ritz camera and seeing if their reader could 
read the images. I do not know how Data Rescue's PhotoRescue could 
rescue images that no reader could read? They are probably on the disk, 
but they cannot be seen by the reader.
