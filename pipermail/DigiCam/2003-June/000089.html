<PRE>When I first ran across the corruption on the card, I had not yet written or
deleted any files/images using the computer. The card was working well
before the corruption.

I tried Data Rescue's PhotoRescue, but I was not able to recover the
corrupted images in the short time I played with it.

It shouldn't make any difference which operating system READS the card.
Did you WRITE to it or delete any images from it using a computer
instead of the camera? I guess things are more relaxed these days and
you can do that, but since it was a big no-no with my first digital
camera, I've always let the camera do all of the writing and deleting.

If you can't get any computer (or printer) to recognize the card, I'm
afraid you will have to try to format it (with the camera). It will
destroy the pictures, of course, but since they already appear to be
destroyed, you are now trying to salvage the card. It sounds to me as
if it was already corrupted before it got to the PC.

Had the card been working well before this last problem? A friend had a
similar problem with a compact flash card, but it was the first time he
used it, so it had to be replaced.
