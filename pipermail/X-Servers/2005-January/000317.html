<PRE>I am trying to help a friend setup his FTP site on Panther Server and 
nothing is going right. He basically has 3 groups of people that would 
connect to the server for FTP uploading and downloading - Family, 
Friends, and Co-workers. Files are divided up into 8 different folders. 
Naturally, some folders are available to 2 groups, some to 1 group, 
some to a different 2 groups, all with some overlap. Total number of 
users is probably around 25-35.

This was very easy to setup in OS 9 using CrushFTP or Rumpus. Every 
group had a folder which contained aliases to the folders they are 
authorized to access. Then each user would be directed to the 
appropiate folder (Friends, Family, Co-worker) upon login. He thought 
that it was finally time to go to X because of OS 9's short file names 
and age.

We cannot figure out how to do this with Panther Server. The only 
reason he bought Panther Server was to be able to do this without using 
command line like he would have to if using the normal Panther OS. Can 
Server do what he wants? Would he have been better off just getting 
Panther Client and getting the X version of CrushFTP or Rumpus? Those 
programs don't seem to have the nice real-time reporting and 
fine-tuning that we thought Panther Server had.

Can someone please set us straight?

As a side note - he also has plans to use this computer with Panther 
Server as his web server. Will he run into the same type of stuff there 
or should he just spend the bucks and get WebStar V?

Thanks,

-= Ken =-
