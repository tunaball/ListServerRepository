<PRE>A lab here has had an OS X Server 10.1.4 box for a while now. It's time to
upgrade and I can get 'em a sweet deal but meanwhile, until they make the
$$$ decision, there is big trouble.

Windows services randmomly stop responding. I'm not sure (various reasons
here), but I strongly suspect that when SAMBA goes brain dead, this
eventually brings down the whole server too, blocking access via AFP, SSH,
Timbuktu, and even keyboard (the screensaver won't go away. You get the
spinning beachball).

A few minutes ago this problem occurred but it was ONLY with SAMBA. I think
we caught it early. I was able to Timbuktu in and try some things (Windows
Services were &quot;on&quot; in Server Admin, but no PC, or Mac via SMB, could
connect. And when I turned Windows services off, they spontaneously
&quot;restarted&quot;, but still no one could connect so they weren't really back on
anyway), but nothing worked and I had to reboot the server.

Immediately after reboot they weren't functioning, but a quick toggle of
this in Server Admin and PC Users finally could connect again.

SO MY QUESTION IS -- HEEELLLLLLLLPPP!!! Is this familiar to anyone? Looking
at the console logs gave me NO information. Anybody got an idea that can
help me get this stable again?
