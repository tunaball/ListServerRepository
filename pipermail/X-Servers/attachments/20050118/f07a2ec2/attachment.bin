We use solely Rumpus for FTP on Mac OS X. We installed about 20
FTP-Servers so far and all have Rumpus on it. Some have Mac OS X
Server, some Mac OS X Client. But we never use the FTP-Service built
in Mac OS X, as it is too tight integrated with the user database
which is often not desired.


As you own already a license of Rumpus (and you know the product), I
think your best solution is to use Rumpus too.



Cheers

Marcel

<excerpt><fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>I am trying to help a
friend setup his FTP site on Panther Server and nothing is going
right. He basically has 3 groups of people that would connect to the
server for FTP uploading and downloading - Family, Friends, and
Co-workers. Files are divided up into 8 different folders. Naturally,
some folders are available to 2 groups, some to 1 group, some to a
different 2 groups, all with some overlap. Total number of users is
probably around 25-35. 


This was very easy to setup in OS 9 using CrushFTP or Rumpus. Every
group had a folder which contained aliases to the folders they are
authorized to access. Then each user would be directed to the
appropiate folder (Friends, Family, Co-worker) upon login. He thought
that it was finally time to go to X because of OS 9's short file names
and age. 


We cannot figure out how to do this with Panther Server. The only
reason he bought Panther Server was to be able to do this without
using command line like he would have to if using the normal Panther
OS. Can Server do what he wants? Would he have been better off just
getting Panther Client and getting the X version of CrushFTP or
Rumpus? Those programs don't seem to have the nice real-time reporting
and fine-tuning that we thought Panther Server had. 


Can someone please set us straight? 


As a side note - he also has plans to use this computer with Panther
Server as his web server. Will he run into the same type of stuff
there or should he just spend the bucks and get WebStar V? 


Thanks,
