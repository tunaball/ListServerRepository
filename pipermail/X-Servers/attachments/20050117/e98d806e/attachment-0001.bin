<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>I am trying to help a friend
setup his FTP site on Panther Server and nothing is going right. He
basically has 3 groups of people that would connect to the server for
FTP uploading and downloading - Family, Friends, and Co-workers. Files
are divided up into 8 different folders. Naturally, some folders are
available to 2 groups, some to 1 group, some to a different 2 groups,
all with some overlap. Total number of users is probably around 25-35. 


This was very easy to setup in OS 9 using CrushFTP or Rumpus. Every
group had a folder which contained aliases to the folders they are
authorized to access. Then each user would be directed to the
appropiate folder (Friends, Family, Co-worker) upon login. He thought
that it was finally time to go to X because of OS 9's short file names
and age. 


We cannot figure out how to do this with Panther Server. The only
reason he bought Panther Server was to be able to do this without
using command line like he would have to if using the normal Panther
OS. Can Server do what he wants? Would he have been better off just
getting Panther Client and getting the X version of CrushFTP or
Rumpus? Those programs don't seem to have the nice real-time reporting
and fine-tuning that we thought Panther Server had. 


Can someone please set us straight? 


As a side note - he also has plans to use this computer with Panther
Server as his web server. Will he run into the same type of stuff
there or should he just spend the bucks and get WebStar V? 


Thanks,
