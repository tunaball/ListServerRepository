<PRE>I'm not sure if this list is still active or not -- haven't seen any 
posts since early November. Anyone here?!! I'm desperate for help, so 
thought I'd give it a try anyway ....

My Xserve G5 running OS 10.3.9 experienced a power outage this 
afternoon. I've had 100% up time since it went online in early 
October 2005. (Adding an interruptible power supply is on my list of 
things to do, but I didn't get to it yet, unfortunately.)

Following the power outage this afternoon, the server restarted and 
came right back online as it was set to do. However the one mailbox 
in the mail system apparently was corrupted somehow, and now I get 
the following error when I try to check mail:

   POP server said: -ERR [SYS/PERM] Could not read message file

I tried deleting the mailbox and recreating it, but that didn't seem 
to make any difference -- I still get the same error -- and the same 
number of messages are still there, too -- does that mean my deletion 
attempt didn't work? I'm not worried too much about losing mail 
already in the box (about 70 messages, I think), as I wouldn't have 
received much important mail today on a Saturday. However I need to 
have it working by Monday at the latest, preferably sooner.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do?

Thanks in advance,

Bob
