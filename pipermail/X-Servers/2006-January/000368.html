<PRE>Greetings, listers.
Trying to avoid eBay with this puppy so thought I'd
let the list know:

We are retiring our original G4 Xserve and will put it
up foor sale. Some particulars include:

Dual Gig processors, 2 Gb Ram; 4 sleds with 120Gb
Hitachi drives in each - the oldest from 2004, the
newest just last year so three year warranties for
these drives still valid. One extra drive sled plus
all the &quot;fake&quot; sleds that came with it when shipped.

Second ethernet card (so dual ethernet capabilities). 
Video card in one slot. I'll throw in a 17&quot; Apple
Display, keyboard, and mouse for the additional cost
of shipping only.

In it's lifetime we replaced one logic board, one
power supply and one ATA bridge - all covered under
AppleCare and done onsite here by M.A.C.Solutions, an
accredited Apple tech and reseller here in Metro
Detroit.

 I still have the original Xserve box from Small Dog
Electronics. It's rack mounted now, so all that
hardware is still attached / intact.

It came with OSX Jaguar Server but the boot drive will
be wiped before we do anything. I just installed a
fresh copy of Panther Server 10.3.9 - Unlimitied
Client so it's good to go.

Still works right now but would have to sell &quot;as is&quot;.
I have a 100% Good Trader status on eBay so wouldn't
sell anything that jeopardized my good standing.

It was our company data server- 19 users.
Basically housed User folders and public art files.
Did not do anything spectacular with it - just ran it
for years with relatively little issues.
I have more problems with our iMacs than this puppy.
Thought we'd keep it as a spare but decided to get a
cluster to back up the G5 to &quot;keep it in the family&quot;.
If interested, drop me an email at;

<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/X-Servers.html">mspeck at strategy-network.com</A>
or call me days at 734-464-8100 and we'll talk Xserve

Price: $1,000.00 plus whatever actual shipping costs
are calculated.
Thanks for the bandwidth.
