<PRE>If you want to implement a powerful email server that you can do just 
about anything with, than sendmail is what you are looking for. 
However, sendmail's power is equal to it's complexity. I have three 
solid years of Unix experience (12 years of Mac) and I've been playing 
with sendmail for about 6 months so far. While I am using it for 
internal use, my comfort level with it is not high enough to implement 
it for external use.
I would recommend looking into qmail. Qmail is also open source and is 
designed as a sendmail replacement, but much easier to configure. Any 
programs you may have written that use sendmail will also work with 
qmail without change. This part is important for me.

One important thing to know about sendmail is that it is strictly an 
mail transfer agent (MTA). It is not a POP3 or IMAP server, which means 
&quot;out of the box&quot; you can't use your standard email client to connect to 
it. You need to also run something like qpopper from Eudora. It's free 
and easy to implement, but it is another piece that you need to 
implement.

Postfix is also a free open source email server you can look into. Like 
qmail, it's designed to replace sendmail.
