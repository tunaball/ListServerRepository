Computers vs. Cars


At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the
computer industry with the auto industry and stated, &quot;If GM had kept up with
the technology like the computer industry, we would all be driving $25.00
cars that got 1,000 miles/gallon&quot;.

In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release
stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft; we would all be
driving cars with the following characteristics:

1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.

2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a
new car.

3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would
have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut
off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue.
And, for some reason, you would simply accept this.

4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your
car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to
reinstall the engine.

5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,
five times as fast and twice as easy to drive-but would run on only five
percent of the roads.

6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be
replaced by a single &quot;This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation&quot; warning
light.

7. The airbag system would ask &quot;Are you sure?&quot; before deploying.

8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and
refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned
the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.

9. Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn how to
drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same
manner as the old car.

10. You'd have to press the &quot;Start&quot; button to turn the engine off.
