<PRE>I hope someone here can help me.  My daughter has a Quicksilver G4 that was
bought for her by Make-A-Wish almost three years ago.  She is terminally ill
and basically confined to bed, so her computer is her lifeline.  She watches
many movies a day on it as well as doing her homebound schoolwork.  After
replacing the hard drive once and the SuperDrive twice and eventually even
the logic board and processor, Apple has agreed to give her new computer.
We are extremely grateful, but we are trying to find a way to pull off her
most recent work from the hard drive.  I don't know if it will be possible
since the computer will not successfully been to try and plays this hard
drive in the G3 we have here or if I can even take a second hard drive.  I
was also wondering if ZIP 250 from this computer can be run in either the
older G3 or the new G5.

 

Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated!
