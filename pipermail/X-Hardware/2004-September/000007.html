That should work fine, unless it's  a larger-capacity stick that the 
older machine just doesn't recognize. Go ahead and try it. With this 
particular combination, the worst that can happen is the RAM either not 
being recognized, or being recognized as a smaller capacity - 256 
instead of 512, for example.

As for transferring files:
Your zip won't quite fit in a G5, but you can get an external USB (or 
FW) zip drive. If it's a zip250, it will read your cartridges. Have you 
considered burning CDs? Most of the Quicksilver machines shipped with a 
burner.

You could also put the old hard drive into a firewire enclosure. This 
is not as good an idea, since Apple is expecting to receive the entire 
computer, not part of it.

You can't connect the two machines, since you need to ship your old 
machine to Apple first. You might want to ask your Apple contact if 
they can ask one of the Apple Retail Stores to help make the exchange - 
they may then be able to do data transfer if necessary (though they may 
charge for it).
