<PRE>&gt;<i>right. i have an iMac G3 333 (Rev D) with 288mb ram and a 6gb hard 
</I>&gt;<i>drive. i have OSX 10.3. im upgrading in the next few weeks, starting 
</I>&gt;<i>with an 80gb hdd. im going to add an extra 256mb ram bringing it to 
</I>&gt;<i>512mb, and then finally im looking at a processor upgrade. i found 
</I>&gt;<i>this upgrade [<A HREF="http://www.technowarehousellc.com/imacg4upgrades.html%5D">http://www.technowarehousellc.com/imacg4upgrades.html]</A> 
</I>&gt;<i>and im looking at getting it. has any one tried one of these?
</I>
Upgrade cards work great. hey really do make a difference. you will 
def see a boost in performance. but while your at it why not also 
upgrade the hard drive.

&gt;<i>is there anything i should know about them?
</I>
Listen to the directions to the letter. believe me that is the best 
advice i could give you on that,

&gt;<i>  will it be as fast as a standard G4 466 or is there going to be a 
</I>&gt;<i>major speed difference?
</I>
it won't be as fast but it will be so close you would not notice.

&gt;<i>i was told Panther will run on it, so im guessing it will. also, on 
</I>&gt;<i>a slightly different note, im thinking of putting the parts in the 
</I>&gt;<i>current imac into a ATX case. mainly because my monitor on the mac 
</I>&gt;<i>is dying, but also because i can get more stuff into the ATX Case 
</I>&gt;<i>(have a CDR drive as a slave to the hard drive and keep my standard 
</I>&gt;<i>CDRom drive working too). has anyone tried this, and if so, any tips?
</I>
Yes transferring your iMac guts to a new case will work. there are 
even kits you can buy on the web. but you are already spending 300 on 
the upgrade card 150 for a new HD (if you take my advice) and maybe 
50 for a new case. why not just by a used G4 tower??????
