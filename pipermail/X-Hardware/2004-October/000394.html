<PRE>
you could try to use PStill instead of Acrobat 6.
It's less costly and is made by one of the first four developers 
outside of Apple who has started to work on Darwin (Mac OS X Core = 
fundations).
I was so enthusiastic of Andrew Stone' abilility to program with Cocoa 
Objective-C and quality of its applications that I have started to 
translate his applications (Stone Studio) in French (For FREE!) to stop 
continuous question of my secretary (about translation).
PStill is part of Stone Studio which is a group of Applications around 
Design and Web principally:
Create his major App is a professional page layout, illustration and 
web page authoring application,
GIFfun makes animated web images via drag and drop,
PStill is is a user friendly PostScript to PDF convertor with many 
options and features. You convert eps, ps, any image format to PDF with 
drag &amp; drop. Repurpose PDF directly from any application using PStill. 
Shrink PDF, combine files to make one PDF, make posters, automated 
print work flow and hot folders,
Slice&amp;Dice turn images into clickable web pages. make rollover images,
PhotoToWeb turns digital photos into websites, full screen slide shows, 
web image preview, thumbnails and complete control over look and feel 
of albums,
PackUpAndGo compress and uncompress folders and files,
TimeEqualsMoney track work and expense entries and then instantly 
create invoices for that work,

You can try them for free during 30 days!

there is 2 particularity :
&#8226; Stone Studio is continuously updated ( normally each month there is 
an upgrade ) and contrary to other company you have Free upgrades  for 
life!!!!
&#8226; Andrew Stone the creator of all these Apps is hearing you! You want a 
new functionality: Ask him, if it's feasible you have a good chance to 
have it one day.

You have to know that the only interest I have with Stone Studio or 
Andrew Stone is that I'm very happy of his Apps and want to see them 
succeed to let Andrew Stone continue to improve his Apps!
