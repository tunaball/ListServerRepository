Really Panther is much better than Jaguar particularly on old machines.

Users can always install software in their home directories, but it 
really is not an issue.  A modern OS like Darwin does not suffer from 
all the conflict nastiness inherent in OS9 or DOS based versions of 
Windows.  If software is badly behaved, it just crashes or can be 
killed without affecting what else is going on.

IPX and Appletalk are both horrid chatty protocols which get routed 
over large areas.  Their days are really past.
IP does just fine.

I would really advise you to bone up on font management in OS X.  It is 
very complex and some old fonts just don't work.  On the other hand you 
can centralise fonts as a network resource, which is really nice 
because you can be sure everyone is using the same versions.
