<PRE>&gt;<i> Thanks for the numbers on the amount of RAM. I had figured 1 GB but 
</I>&gt;<i> see I was under estimating. Some are on Quark 4.11 and some on Quark 
</I>&gt;<i> 5.01. They do create pdf files of everything. I think they mostly save 
</I>&gt;<i> the page as an ESP and then distill it with Acrobat 5.05.
</I>
I wouldn't go over 2 GB - unless they are working on huge photoshop 
files. One of the best things to do is have some program run in the 
background (menumeters, for example), and see how much memory is used. 
Most of the designers work on files from 56 Kb to 2 GB in Photoshop, 
depending on web/print usage.

We go the .ps or .eps - distill route as well.


&gt;<i> The info on Acrobat 6 and colorsync profiles is invaluable. Thank you.
</I>
No problem - took me way too long to troubleshoot.


&gt;<i> When upgrading to OSX (if they stick to that plan) I plan on 
</I>&gt;<i> reformatting the drives and installing OSX. I am on 10.2.8 and am very 
</I>&gt;<i> happy with it. The geek in production who has an iMac running the 
</I>&gt;<i> latest OS 10.3.x and does nothing but games, wants 10.3.x on the 
</I>&gt;<i> computers in Production. I want whatever version is going to give the 
</I>&gt;<i> least headaches. I may even assign the administrator password at 
</I>&gt;<i> installation so the users cannot download and install everything their 
</I>&gt;<i> heart desires. They are horrible at doing that and causing constant 
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
</I>
10.3 has been pretty nice, and the response (group started from the 
earliest mac to 9, then to 10.2, 10.3 a year later) was positive when 
we went from Jaguar to Panther. I'd give it a try if you haven't 
already.



&gt;<i> Kevin, I am not sure what smoke the network guys are blowing but will 
</I>&gt;<i> know more Nov. 2. The publisher thinks that upgrading will do away 
</I>&gt;<i> with AppleTalk and IPX (and has been told by the NW guys that those 
</I>&gt;<i> things are bad and holding the PC side of the network back). I am not 
</I>&gt;<i> a network person, so don't know exactly where they are coming from.
</I>
Can't comment here, out PC tech guy wanted Appletalk dead (not sure 
why).

</PRE>
