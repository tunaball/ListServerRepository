Hello


I have just installed in my G5 a Rocket Raid card 1820A.

Not wanting any problems with Apple support I have put 4 x Western
Digital Raptor 36 GB 10 000 rpm disks in an external Aluminium PC
tower from LIAN LI 

http://www.lian-li.com/product.php?action=viewPD&prdid=1120


I have put the disk away from each other with at least a disk space
between them ( 2 in the disk compartiment, 1 in the 2.5 compartiment
and one in the 3.5 compartiment (where are the CD and DVD)

In this PC tower all  I have is the Power supply (400W) and 4 raptor.


The question is what temperature is acceptable in the tower and should
I add more fans (I have 3 , the one from the PSU and two in the front)

Best regards


Cyril
