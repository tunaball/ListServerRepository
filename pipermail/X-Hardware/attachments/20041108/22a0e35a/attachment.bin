Vincent,


I use Jaguar, so I didn't realize that. Nonetheless, back when the
original post was first up I emailed TDavis directly with those
instructions, and he replied that what I suggested solved his problem!
He must have figured out what he needed to do.

<excerpt>John, there is no such Preference Pane in Panther's System 

Preferences unless you manually copy it over from a Jaguar 

installation. In Panther, the default browser is set by opening 

Safari and using its Preferences menu, or by using any of several 3rd 

party tools such as More Internet, MisFox, etc.
