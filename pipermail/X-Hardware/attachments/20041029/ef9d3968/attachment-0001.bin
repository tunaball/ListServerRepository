I was so enthusiastic of Andrew Stone' abilility to program with Cocoa
Objective-C and quality of its applications that I have started to
translate his applications (Stone Studio) in French (For FREE!) to
stop continuous question of my secretary (about translation).

web page authoring application,

succeed to let Andrew Stone continue to improve his Apps!
