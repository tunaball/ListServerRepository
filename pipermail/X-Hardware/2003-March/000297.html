<PRE>I've a colleague's original TiBook G4/400 which appears to never have 
been used - the owner is a gadget-lover who doesn't always do 
anything after experiencing the thrill of acquisition! Anyway, I 
agreed to check it out and determine value, etc. (and am considering 
it as a replacement for one of my trusty-but-overused Lombards). But 
I cannot get the machine to power on! A press of the battery check 
button gives not even a glimmer of the LEDs. I've tried a known-good 
power adapter (from my wife's iBook) and I get nothing. I tried the 
power reset button several times and even tried holding it for more 
than 30 seconds. I then decided that it must be the battery bt 
decided to get some confirmation. I took the laptop to the Soho Apple 
Store's Genius Bar and they took it to try some tests. I assume that 
they tried some of the same things that I had. They also say that 
they tried a known-good battery and to &quot;kick-start&quot; the internal 
battery. So now their advice is:
a) Give it in for official repair. It's not under warranty so it'll 
attract a $310 flat charge.
b) Try TekServe and get their estimate for the nature and cost of the 
part-level repair they deem necessary.

So, listees, any suggestions? Is there any obvious trouble-shooting 
measure that I've overlooked?
-- 
Bottom line, it's not worth falling love with this junk! By the time 
it breaks, the new one is better and less expensive than the repair 
bill.
