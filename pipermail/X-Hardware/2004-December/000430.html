This is the nature of the single lens reflex.  The light is either 
going to the viewfinder, or to the sensor, not both.  This is how you 
get a true, through the lens view in the viewfinder.

Canon's remote capture utility comes at no extra charge, and works fine 
on my powerbook with my 10d.  It is slow, since it is only USB 1.0.

Just as another datapoint, I have never had to clean my 10D sensor in 
more than a year, and there are no visible dust spots on the images.  I 
would be afraid of damaging the sensor, but I would do it myself 
anyway, if needed, and just be very careful.  There are several 
solutions for this out there, I have heard good things about 
visibledust.com's products.

</I>&gt;<i> Good! Does Photoshop CS's plugin work in real time? I don't think I'll

</I>
Contact me off-group, and if you like, I will send you a raw file from 
my 10d after work today.
