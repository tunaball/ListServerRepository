<PRE>(online at <A HREF="http://www.forbes.com/2003/04/29/cx_ah_0429tentech.html">http://www.forbes.com/2003/04/29/cx_ah_0429tentech.html</A>)
... Also, there is some new Apple-made technology at work that protects
their interests. While Jobs didn't talk about it much during his
speech, Apple has over the last year been quietly developing a
digital-rights management software technology called Fairplay. What it
does is allow you to do things that generally you're already allowed to
do with CDs. You're allowed, for example, to make a copy of a CD for
backup purposes should the CD be lost or damaged. The hard drive of
your computer in this case simply replaces the cassette tape that many
used to rely on for creating a backup.

You're also allowed to create a custom mix which, again, many used to
do on cassette tapes, but in recent years has been the domain of the
CD-R disc and the MP3 file. But with the new iTunes, you're limited to
ten copies of a single playlist before you have to change it. That's
Fairplay at work.

You're also allowed to listen to the music pretty much wherever you
want. That may be on an iPod--you're allowed to put a song on an
unlimited number of iPods--or on other computers. In the case of
computers, you're limited to three, which should be enough for a
computer at home, a computer at work and the laptop you travel with.
Again, that is Fairplay at work...
