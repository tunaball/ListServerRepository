<PRE>It sounds like some of your tunes are going to someplace other than  
your main hard drive. If you click on the tune with the exclamation  
point will it play? That keeps happening to me but if I click on the  
exclamation point iTunes will go find it.  I keep my library on my  
main drive but sometimes one will slip over to an external drive. Who  
knows why.

&gt;<i> Quick question: What does the exclamation point that appears after  
</I>&gt;<i> some, but
</I>&gt;<i> not all, of the tune numbers in my iTunes Library mean? Does it  
</I>&gt;<i> indicate
</I>&gt;<i> that the album artwork has been downloaded, or does it indicate  
</I>&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;<i> else, altogether?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And then, the complicated question(s): I am now having problems with a
</I>&gt;<i> second iPod (80 Gig iPod Video), which says it has synched, but  
</I>&gt;<i> which is
</I>&gt;<i> missing somewhere near half the tunes in each playlist that I have  
</I>&gt;<i> checked,
</I>&gt;<i> so far. Why would this happen?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It has been suggested that there is corruption in my iTunes Library  
</I>&gt;<i> database
</I>&gt;<i> - or a problem with the iPod itself. The software and preferences are
</I>&gt;<i> brand-freshly installed. If there is corruption in the Library  
</I>&gt;<i> itself, how
</I>&gt;<i> does one find and repair that sort of problem (which I have never  
</I>&gt;<i> heard of
</I>&gt;<i> before)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Should I just try creating new playlists, on the assumption that  
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps the
</I>&gt;<i> lists are in some way damaged? Can I do that by dragging the  
</I>&gt;<i> contents from
</I>&gt;<i> one of the present ones to a new list, or do I have to start over by
</I>&gt;<i> dragging the contents from the main Library file, which would be  
</I>&gt;<i> MUCH more
</I>&gt;<i> time-consuming?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This new/refurbished iPod also had problems with synching in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place, and kept stopping, balking during the sync process, and  
</I>&gt;<i> telling me
</I>&gt;<i> that its hard drive could not be read from or written to. Hmmm...two  
</I>&gt;<i> similar
</I>&gt;<i> messages on different machines, makes me wonder about the Library.  
</I>&gt;<i> However,
</I>&gt;<i> this one is still returnable. Should I keep trying, or return it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note: all of the problems with both iPods occurred right after I  
</I>&gt;<i> upgraded
</I>&gt;<i> iTunes to version 7.6. I don't know any easy way to go backward to an
</I>&gt;<i> earlier version; if you try to revert to an earlier version of  
</I>&gt;<i> iTunes, you
</I>&gt;<i> get the message that the Library cannot be opened because it was  
</I>&gt;<i> created by
</I>&gt;<i> an earlier version of the software. I do, presumably, have either  
</I>&gt;<i> one or two
</I>&gt;<i> recent, earlier versions on my backup drives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also have the entire iTunes Library, backed up about a month ago,  
</I>&gt;<i> before
</I>&gt;<i> all this happened.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please advise.
