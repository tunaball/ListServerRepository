<PRE>
Here's my take on this frustrating problem from my own experience with  
upgrading the OS and having to move song files.

The exclamation point means that the iTunes library can't find where  
the audio file is located. It knows the tune belongs in the library  
and in the playlist but can't find it to play or to sync it with an  
iPod. If you try to play the playlist containing such songs it will  
skip them, the same thing it does when you try to sync them.

If you double click on a song with an exclamation point it should ask  
you if you want to locate it and will then allow you to go through  
your audio files to find the one that should be connected to the song  
in the playlist. If you select the song and hit the &quot;open&quot; button, the  
song file will be reconnected to the song in the iTunes library/ 
playlist and start playing.

If it doesn't work that way then I would agree that the library is  
corrupted and probably can't be repaired without rebuilding everything.

Doug Adams has an iTunes applescript for this problem of orphaned or  
&quot;dead&quot; song files. It's called Bring Out Yer Dead. You can find it here:
<A HREF="http://dougscripts.com/itunes/index.php">http://dougscripts.com/itunes/index.php</A>
by searching for Bring Out Yer Dead (the title is a Monty Python  
reference in case you were wondering). There are some other scripts  
for the same thing that I haven't tried.
I asked Doug Adams if this could be done in bulk or for a script that  
would fix the entire library but he said he didn't think that would be  
possible. It has to be done one at a time.

If your problem is orphaned song files, creating a new playlist will  
not solve it as you can't add a song with an exclamation point to a  
playlist. You could import or drag all the song files from wherever  
they're located into iTunes and they will then show up (assuming the  
library isn't corrupted) but you will have to then delete the songs  
with exclamation points and replace them in each playlist. This is not  
a problem for a few hundred songs but it's a royal pain if you have  
have tens of thousands of songs and hundreds of playlists.
