And have you tried using it to recover a working iTunes Library from a  
past moment? Does it work as expected? Easy to do?

Nope. You haven't supplied much info, for anyone to help, but I'm not  
the one anyway. I think that Doug of Applescript fame is contactable  
through that web site, either directly or through forums. Give him  
some more basic information always needed to obtain help: Computer  
model (not just &quot;iMac&quot;, there are tons of those), the OS version,  
version of all applications relevant to issue (iTunes, maybe  
QuickTime, perhaps iPod model, etc) and brief description of what you  
are trying to accomplish, the specific steps you took, what happened,  
including exact error messages...like that.

&gt;<i> I select the books in the Music folder that I want to move and then  
</I>&gt;<i> run the script.
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing.....
</I>

In order to be certain, I'd have to look it up, which I'm too lazy to  
do right now. My recollection is that &quot;Make Bookmarkable&quot; script was  
not designed to &quot;move&quot; anything. It was designed to change the file  
type. Audio Book files which are able to resume where you last stopped  
have a different ending on the file extension. If you rip a book from  
a CD, you will have something.mp3 files. If you get an Audio Book  
file, it will be something.aa and will be &quot;bookmarkable&quot;.
