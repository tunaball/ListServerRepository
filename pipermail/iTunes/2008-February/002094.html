I have iTunes v 7.6 on a G5 iMac. I have never seen any connection  
between the name of the Playlist and information on a burned CD. The  
term &quot;Playlist&quot; refers to the name you create on the left column of  
iTunes, and is simply a reference for a collection of songs you choose  
to group together. The information on a CD can be altered by selecting  
a song and then selecting &quot;Get Info&quot; from the File menu. This menu  
offers many categories, including Album, Artist, Track #, etc. But not  
&quot;Playlist&quot;.

I can only guess that you may have named your playlist the same name  
as the name of the album, and then assumed that the &quot;playlist&quot; info  
was transfered. When you are looking for this information to appear  
from the burned CD, where are you looking? Are you playing it on  
another computer? A CD player that has an LED display?
