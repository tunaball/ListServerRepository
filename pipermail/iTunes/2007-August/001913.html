First of all, Windows ME is the worst piece of crap operating system 
that Microsoft has ever had the nerve to kick out the door. Upgrade your 
operating system to Windows XP, and then spend some time downloading the 
numerous patches, fixes and upgrades to XP. You will avoid constant 
frustration and irritation by doing so. If you don't believe me, call up 
a repair shop and ask them it they would let a family member use ME.

Another possibility is to sell your computer and buy a Mac. Apple 
created the iPod, iTunes and although they eventually ported it over to 
Windows, it all works much better within the Mac operating system. Its 
effortless. I won't help my friends who have Windows machines any more, 
I've switched over to Macs and they are so much easier to support I just 
can't be bothered with the constant insanities of Windows. No spyware, 
no adware, no trojans, no virus, no worms on a Mac. Don't have to buy 
those virus and spyware protection programs, don't have to put up with 
the slow downs they cause.

You don't mention what happens when you try to download iTunes, or what 
error messages you have, or any hints at all. Your request is a little 
like someone asking for their car to be fixed, but don't say what kind 
of car they have or what kind of problems they have or when it happens 
or what noise it makes. There's just not much to go on. You could just 
try again another day, sometimes the server you are contacting is 
overloaded. Have you downloaded anything else successfully?
