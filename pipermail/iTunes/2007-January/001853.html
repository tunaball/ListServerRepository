<PRE>On Tue, Jan 30, 20077:52 PM, the following words from Paul Baily
<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/itunes.html">mglists at paulbaily.com</A>, emerged from a plethora of SPAM ...

&gt;<i>Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Apologies in advance if this is a FAQ, I'm guessing the answer to  
</I>&gt;<i>this will be one word and two letters long but would be gladly  
</I>&gt;<i>mistaken. Is it possible to mark a track as belonging to more than  
</I>&gt;<i>one album? Let me expand on that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Let's say you have the whole discography of an artist plus the  
</I>&gt;<i>inevitable &quot;Best Of&quot; albums that comprise of tracks you already have  
</I>&gt;<i>plus the tantalising one or two unique tracks that don't appear  
</I>&gt;<i>anywhere else. Adding the &quot;Best Of&quot; album(s) means you have say 18  
</I>&gt;<i>duplicate tracks plus two unique ones. The question I have is this:  
</I>&gt;<i>do you know of a way to remove the duplicate tracks (thereby freeing  
</I>&gt;<i>up valuable iPod space) yet have each album listing still complete  
</I>&gt;<i>should you want to play by album? I'm guessing I'd have to resort to  
</I>&gt;<i>playlists to achieve this, yes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>thanks for your time, best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Paul.
</I>
Sounds like your best bet is to learn to be creative when making your
playlists. I'm in the same boat, having multiple copies of the same
songs. However, with some songs, the duplicates are unique for me. I
bought Tina Arena's Don't Ask CD because I like one song, Chains. But
then I got one of those &quot;Greatest  ...&quot; CDs with multiple artists that
has a version of Chains that is really horrible to listen to. I also
have White Christmas, by Aaron Neville and I really like both of the two
versions I have, so both are keepers. I also have quite a few
collections that are different because one was live, or the artist redid
the song years later. I have such an eclectic collection of music that I
think that duplicates aren't always duplicates so when I buy an entire
album, I always check to see how differently one artist or band sings
the same songs                             and find that the dupes are
often interesting. Then again, I bought the 80Gig video iPod in
November, so it isn't yet full. My weekly trips to the iTMS will
probably change that fairly quickly - hopefully I can get a new iPod by then.

Good luck with your duplicates.
