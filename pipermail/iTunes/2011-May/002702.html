To zoom in or out on a Web page:
Click the Magnifying glass icon at the bottom right corner of the Internet Explorer window. Or, select the arrow to open the list of options and select one. 
To zoom in or out on a Web page:
Press CTRL + PLUS SIGN (+) to zoom in, or CTRL + HYPHEN (-) to zoom out. 


&gt;<i> When I do get a support person, they direct me to a web page that is trying - for 13 minutes now - to download something... a video? I can't tell... that is supposed to help me, but since it won't download I can't tell. and the stupid message tree doesn't recognize anything beyond answers that don't apply to the situation.

Re-download and re-install iTunes.

It's not  at all necessary to talk to somebody at Apple. 

<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/contact/">http://www.apple.com/support/contact/</A>

Click on the link labeled:

Use Express Lane to connect with an expert in Apple Support

However, if you desire to talk to somebody:

Contact Apple Support

Second phone number on list:

U.S. iPhone technical support: 1-800-MY-IPHONE (1-800-694-7466)

&gt;<i> Last time this happened, a few years ago, I went directly to a person who walked me through the process. This is NOT an improvement.

Hmmmmm,

Sony, SanDisk, Coby, Microsoft, maybe?

&gt;<i> Trouble is, the only place I know is Amazon, and they don't have mp3 players, only the Kindle.
</I>
Amazon has 4 pages of mp3 players--not including Apple gear!

Believe me, I understand all about getting upset about malfunctioning electronics. But, all of the information required to fix the problems you encountered was very easily found by employing a search engine. It took me 5 minutes to come up with these. Besides, this email list has a lot of good knowledgeable resources subscribed to it. Isn't that why we're all here?
