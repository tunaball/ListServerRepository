<PRE>    Alright, I have a seriously weird problem...

    The artist name on a number of songs keep disappearing! Seriously. 
And it seems to go in a somewhat alphabetical order as well (but not 
predictably). For example, my 'Miller's Crossing' score had all of the 
Carter Burwell songs blank, but the one by Frank Patterson was still 
listed.
    When the songs play (or you get info on them), the artist name will 
re-appear (after about a 4 second 'freeze'), so it obviously 'knows' 
the info somewhere... But until that happens, the info isn't searchable 
(ie a search of &quot;Carter&quot; would have left out 'Miller's Crossing'), so 
it is incredibly frustrating. Plus, I have worked very hard to keep my 
MP3 collection organized, and this plays havoc with it!

    This happened a lot in iTunes 2 (enough to where I was very close to 
junking iTunes!), but seemed to go away with iTunes 3. However, I think 
that upgrade happened around the same time I spilt my enormous library 
into two different ones (one for 'Rock' and one for 'film scores'). Now 
that the problem has started to re-appear, I think I can cancel that 
out...
    Does anyone know if there is there some known bugs once the library 
reaches a certain size, like say 22,000 songs? I know the limit is 
somewhere around 32,000...

    Please help... I love my iTunes, but this is driving me crazier than 
usual!!
