I would suggest that the arrogance is attributable to Comcast, not  
people who live in cities. The people who make those sorts of  
decisions are ISP executives, not Joe the Plumber who lives in  
Chicago. I'm hopeful that President Obama is aware of this  
manipulation on the part of ISPs and is ready to generate some  
changes. He has already promised to spend some stimulus money on  
improving the infrastructure. Lets hope that it includes broadband  
accessible to all. Seems like 70 years ago it was a governmental  
agency that was responsible for &quot;rural electrification&quot; when the power  
companies decided it wasn't profitable to run power lines out to rural  
homes. Now history repeats itself with broadband instead of electrical  
power.

I don't mean to be argumentative here, but if you aren't clear on who  
is responsible for the poor decisions that result in your pain, you  
can't be effective in generating change.
