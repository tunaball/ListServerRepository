Becca: couple of thoughts.

I share your pain on the satellite internet situation. We suffered  
through the same problem -- only being able to download podcasts  
overnight due to the bandwidth limitations during the day. Since I am  
a night owl, I would start the downloads before I went to bed (after  
midnight) and make sure things were working properly. Even then, I'd  
often awake to discover that some of the downloads had failed due to  
timeouts on the satellite internet service. I have since found an  
alternative to satellite, in large part because of the iTunes podcast  
download problems with satellite.

Not sure how files are organized on the Windows side, but on the Mac  
there is a folder called Music for each user. Inside that folder,  
there is another folder called iTunes that contains all of your iTunes  
settings (including playlists) and all of your music and podcasts. You  
might find such a folder under mydocuments. If so, see whether the  
music and podcasts are still there and, if so, duplicate it in a  
folder with a new name (perhaps music2). With any luck, you should be  
able to point your newly-installed iTunes to this folder and not have  
to reload everything.

As for reinstalling iTunes, I'd go to the Apple.com site and download  
(overnight) the iTunes program and then do the reinstall. With luck,  
there won't be any problems with the download. Once you get it going  
again, see if it picks up the old iTunes music. If not, then go to the  
Preferences for iTunes, then the Advanced tab and change the location  
of the iTunes music folder to your duplicated folder in Music2. You  
may need to select and drag all of the music in the iTunes music  
folder to the main iTunes window, to re-establish the proper links.

Hope everything gets back to &quot;normal&quot;.

Cheers

Jeff
