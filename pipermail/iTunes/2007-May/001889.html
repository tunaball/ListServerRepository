<PRE>On Wed, May 9, 20074:53 PM, the following words from Michael Prete
<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/itunes.html">michaelprete at cox.net</A>, emerged from a plethora of SPAM ...

</I>&gt;<i>You might try this valuable resource provided by Apple, it has

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/ipodshuffle/">http://www.apple.com/support/ipodshuffle/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One of the methods suggested is to reset the shuffle. Have you tried 
</I>&gt;<i>that? Its a good place to start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Which shuffle do you have?

I'd check that your shuffle isn't already full. I just got my first iPod
in November and am constantly thinking of the size. Although mine is an
80G video iPod, I have to keep in mind that mp3 files will take up more
room than AAC files. (Before I got my iPod, I didn't convert the mp3
songs I have in my iTunes Library to AAC because those were all CD
imports and that's a task I'll probably continue to put off until my
iPod gets too full and I can't afford another.) So, one of the first
things I would attempt is finding out if the shuffle has reached capacity.

According to Apple's information on the capacity:

How many songs can iPod shuffle hold? 
Up to 120 songs on the 512 MB model and up to 240 songs on the 1 GB
model (based on 128 kbps AAC files at 4 minutes per song).

Assuming that only 65 songs have been added, the shuffle is about half
full. If you are sure all the songs are AAC files, then I suggest you
proceed with the troubleshooting steps Apple provides. &lt;http://
