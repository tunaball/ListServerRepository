I know this thread is kinda old, but I ran across the following item
on MacInTouch that might be of interest:



<fontfamily><param>Osaka</param><bigger>Hyperbolic Software's
<color><param>0000,0000,EEEE</param>iTunes Dupes Barrier</color> 1.0.1
can locate duplicate songs in your iTunes and iPod song databases
using the song name, artist name, album, and file size as criteria.
The software can also combine with the company's Doublet Scan 10 to
offer more advanced searches. iTunes Dupes Barrier is free for Mac OS
X 10.3 with iTunes 4.0 or later.

Maybe this will help.

I found that  4050 tracks are in [
<color><param>BCCE,04A8,04A8</param>/user/axxll/music/ itunes</color>
] 

those tracks where the initial tracks i had  before i conducted
editing and cleaning up of tags  etc.


in another location:  [
<color><param>0B95,0C60,A47B</param>user/axxll/music/ itunes/itunes
music</color> ]   there are  3047 tracks.  those are the cleaned up
tracks and those are what i see in Itunes library pane and i listen to.


The Quesiton is :   How do i get rid of  the first 4050 tracks yet
maintain the second collection?  I am scared to delete the  first
batch at 
[<color><param>BCCE,04A8,04A8</param>/user/axxll/music/itunes</color>] 
thinking that this is the root of the second batch at  [
<color><param>0B95,0C60,A47B</param>/user/axxll/music/itunes/itunes
music </color>]
