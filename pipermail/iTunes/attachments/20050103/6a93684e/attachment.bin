Is iTunes set to 'look for remote speakers'? (iTunes
Preferences->Audio)

I assume that the 'enable AirTunes on this base station' option was
checked during initial setup of the base station? You can confirm this
using the Airport Admin Utility (select the appropriate base station
and view the current settings in the Music tab).

If this is all in order, then I guess there might be a problem with
the hardware involved.

Network access and AirTunes music can operate simultaneously on the
same base station - I have an Airport Express that functions as both a
network point for an EyeHome media device and AirTunes point for a
Yamaha receiver. The AirTunes capability is just an 'as well as'
feature of the APEX base station.

Cheers

<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> Can someone explain to me the
correct way to add an Airport Express station for Airtunes? I seem to
have to add mine over and over again, manually reset the unit 3-4
times, and on bad days go without because neither of my PowerBooks (Al
15, Pismo) can see it.</fontfamily>

two be mutually exclusive?  </fontfamily>
