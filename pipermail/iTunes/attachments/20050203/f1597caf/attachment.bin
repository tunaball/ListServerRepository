If you set up the A-Exp as a wireless bridge, then the Powerbook would
connect to it. Unfortunately, the A-Exp will only connect to an
Airport in this mode (actually, there is apparently some convuluted
way to bridge to a non-Apple product, but it isn't easy to do and you
probably need admin access to the wireless router.
