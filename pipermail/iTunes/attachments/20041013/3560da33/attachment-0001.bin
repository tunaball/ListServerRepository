Hi all,


i think my music collection is duplicated. Here is why. 


I found that  4050 tracks are in [
<color><param>BCCE,04A8,04A8</param>/user/axxll/music/ itunes</color>
] 

those tracks where the initial tracks i had  before i conducted
editing and cleaning up of tags  etc.


in another location:  [
<color><param>0B95,0C60,A47B</param>user/axxll/music/ itunes/itunes
music</color> ]   there are  3047 tracks.  those are the cleaned up
tracks and those are what i see in Itunes library pane and i listen to.


The Quesiton is :   How do i get rid of  the first 4050 tracks yet
maintain the second collection?  I am scared to delete the  first
batch at 
[<color><param>BCCE,04A8,04A8</param>/user/axxll/music/itunes</color>] 
thinking that this is the root of the second batch at  [
<color><param>0B95,0C60,A47B</param>/user/axxll/music/itunes/itunes
music </color>]


As u can see i get scared easily. so help me please
