I'm attempting to do something I used to be able to do no problem,
burn a playlist to a CD.  The machine is a dual 866MHz mirrored drive
door with OS X 10.2.8, and I've checked software update and it says
I'm all updated.  In Itunes I select File:Burn Playlist To Disc then
insert the disc when prompted.  It says it's checking and then says
it's writing the first song.  After several minutes it spits out the
disc and a dialogue box appears that says "ITunes can't burn this CD
because the burn speed is too fast for your CD burner or media. 
Choose a lower speed in the burning pane of iTunes preferences, then
try burning again."  So I click OK then checked the burning pane in
ITunes preferences.  I clicked on ITunes:Preferences:Advanced:Burning. 
It says Preferred speed is maximum possible, which I already knew
since I've always left it there.  I've never had trouble before and
nothing has changed except for routine software updates.  The CD says
imation 10X-24X CD-RW 74MIN/650MB.  The playlist I'm trying to burn
says 402.7MB.  I've tried setting the speed preference lower and tried
different CDs, all with the same result.


What went wrong?  Should I shell out for the latest OS?


Thanks for any advice,
