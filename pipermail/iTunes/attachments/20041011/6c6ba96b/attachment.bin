Axel, Check out the Advanced Preference pane in iTunes.  There is an
option to "Keep iTunes Music folder organized" which creates artist
folders and will

update your changes to the song titles from your tags.  I use it all
the time so I can browse my music drive identical to the iTunes
library.

<excerpt>Hi,

I have over 3000 sound tracks in my itunes which i have organized 
brushed up their titles  etc..

I noticed that the edited tracks are only present in my Itunes
Library.  How do i reach the original file and how do i replace those
tracks in the (original folder) with those i have edited in my Itunes.?
