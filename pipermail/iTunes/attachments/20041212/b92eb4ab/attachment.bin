FireWire adapter cards for WinTel PCs are dirt cheap these days. You
can easily find one for $10, sometimes less. Install one and you're
good to go.

<excerpt>Folks,


I have an original iPod (the first series - 5gB). It has only a
firewire

connector. For a couple of years I have been sporadically trying to
unload

it onto various unsuspecting friends.


With the immense popularity of iPods as gifts this season, many of my

friends with teenage kids are now seriously asking if the unit is
compatible

with their Windows PC's. I'm guessing that they are unlikely to have

firewire available, so my question is: is there some way to use the
old iPod

with a Windows PC?
