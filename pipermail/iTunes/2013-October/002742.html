<PRE>Just got this from iTunes customer service/help
If ALL of previous purchases are not available it kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it? but what I wanted was in my purchased window but it wouldn't let me download again.


&gt;<i> You can also download your previously purchased music, non-rental TV shows, Apps and Books again as long as they are on your Purchased page. Please note that some of your previously-purchased content may not be available for download again if it is no longer available on the iTunes Store, App Store, or iBooks Store.
</I>
This was the way I solved the problem but now I'm going get a lesson on how to back up the entire library to one of my RAID  drives.

&gt;<i> Nothing would work even tho the shows are not in my iTunes or Media folder. I removed after watching the shows the first time. Since I couldn't find a fix from your links I downloaded the season onto my MacBook Air, then copied the files from the media folder onto a thumb drive, moved them to my 17&#8221; Mac laptop and &quot;added&quot; them to the iTunes library. I should be able to download purchases more than once or twice or more to the same computer as long as I have removed the files first shouldn't i? I haven't had this happen before. I shouldn't have to use a new computer each time...that doesn't make sense.
