Lots of superstition in these things.

Sure, it happens, but it's rare.

</I>
As it says: &quot;There is considerable debate about performing Repair Permissions as part of regular maintenance.&quot; Yep; I debate it. Plenty of others do too. 

Even back in 2005, Unsanity wrote an article about this: <A HREF="http://unsanity.org/archives/000410.php.">http://unsanity.org/archives/000410.php.</A> And Daring Fireball followed up shortly after that: <A HREF="http://daringfireball.net/2006/04/repair_permissions_voodoo.">http://daringfireball.net/2006/04/repair_permissions_voodoo.</A>
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for swap files, they do take up space. And, if swap file removal serves no purpose, I find it interesting that there are 25 different programs (in addition to AppleJack) that include swap file removal as part of their function. Take a look here: &lt;<A HREF="http://delete.software.informer.com/download-delete-swapfile-mac/">http://delete.software.informer.com/download-delete-swapfile-mac/</A>&gt;
</I>
Removing swap files can simply be dangerous, as they are used by the system. If you want to remove them - and I don't know why you would, because if you don't have a couple of GB free on your drive then you'd better upgrade your drive - just reboot. There's a reason why you can't remove swap files easily (though you could simply go to /var/vm and remove them manually if you want).
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Utilities like that give a false sense of security. It used to be, &quot;I repaired permissions, and that didn't do anything,&quot; because in 99.9% of cases it doesn't. Now it's, &quot;I ran ApplJack/Onyx/Cocktail and it didn't do anything.&quot;<A HREF="p://listserver.themacintoshguy.com/mailman/listinfo/itunes">p://listserver.themacintoshguy.com/mailman/listinfo/itunes</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you might include some references to back up your allegations that all these functions are useless? It seems, at the very least, debatable.
</I>
Debatable, because people are always looking for solutions to problems. But I read constantly how people have run &lt;utility-name&gt; and that didn't resolve their problems. There are lots of these utilities because lots of people _think_ they make a difference. It took years for people to stop &quot;updating prebinging&quot;, long after it was no longer necessary. But, hey, there's still programs that do that too.
