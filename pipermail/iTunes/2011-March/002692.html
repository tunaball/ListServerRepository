<PRE>I have three of the old click wheel iPods. One has never been used, one is slightly used...maybe once and the first one that I use most of the time. I love these which is why I kept buying them just in case they decided to discontinue that model. I have an iTouch which I really don't like much for books. And I keep a few on my iPhone. I listen quite a lot on my iPad which is nice when I'm at home.

&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t blame you for wanting to keep the 2nd Gen iPod. I also have one that still works with the original 20 GB drive - maybe I am just lucky. My granddaughter is now using it. She doesn&#8217;t treat it with the same care that I did, but it still rocks on...

</I>&gt;<i> For some reason, Apple gave up on the much superior control wheel and buttons on those old units. Perhaps they were just too expensive to make, but they were certainly much nicer to use than any of the iPod controllers since.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It has occurred to me that perhaps there exists a tiny flash drive that could be used in the place of the fragile hard drive that came with the unit. Have you searched? With one of those, your iPod might last forever.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi List,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For some reason I can&#8217;t give up my second generation iPod and am once again replacing the hard drive.  I have done this twice before with new drive purchased on eBay  with great results, but this time I went with used drives (I&#8217;m on the 3rd one) and all three make the click of death.  The iPod has been recognized by iPod Updater with all three drives installed, but says the drive needs to be initialized and opens Disk Utility.  After telling Disk Utility to initialize the disc the process starts, but stalls right away and the drive makes the click of death until disconnected.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My question.  Is there anything else about the iPod which would cause this problem or have I gotten 3 bad drives?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
