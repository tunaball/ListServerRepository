<PRE>Hey All,

I'm hoping you can give me a hand.

This morning I tried to create a play list from my library. When I  
tried to add certain albums to the list, they would not drop onto the  
playlist icon, and all of the tunes involved have exclamation points  
next to them. I've never understood how/where to interpret the  
exclamation points when I've seen them. All of the tunes I'm trying to  
move into the playlist have been ripped from my cd's.  If I double  
click on any of the tunes involved, they will play. Smart Playlists  
seem to be working.

I have not experienced the exclamation points until I had my library  
transferred to a Time Capsule, which I'm using as an NAS, as well as  
for it's backup functions. I have the Capsule hardwired via Ethernet.

What's strange about this is that I have successfully created a  
playlist or two since my system conversion, but now I don't seem to be  
able to.

My music library lived in a hot rodded G3 with 1.6 terrabytes of  
memory. In order to make my OS current, I'm now using a Mac Mini as my  
main &quot;head&quot; unit with the Time Capsule as an NAS. Everything that was  
in the G3 was either moved into the Mini, or the Capsule. My music  
library lives on the Capsule. The Capsule seems to be functioning  
correctly otherwise.

My tech who help with all this was concerned that he didn't update the  
iTunes that came with the OS 10.5.5 disc first, before migrating my  
music library. He realized this might be a problem after he already  
made the migration.

Any ideas? I'm stumped.

Scott
</PRE>
