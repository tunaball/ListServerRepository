<PRE>Well it's Glenn Frey Smuggler's Blues so that spelling would help with 
the googling. There is a program called Utilitunes (download from Apple 
site) which looks for album art, liner notes and lyrics for whatever 
song is playing. Great program. Filling in album art myself.

FYI, the lyrics are:

There's trouble on the streets tonight

I can feel it in my bones

I had a premonition that he should not go alone

I knew the gun was loaded

But I didn't think he'd kill

Everything exploded and the blood began to spill

So baby here's your ticket

Keep your suitcase in your hand

Here's a little money now

Do it just the way we planned

You be cool for twenty hours

And I'll pay you twenty grand



I'm sorry it went down like this

But someone had to lose

It's the nature of the business

It's the smuggler's blues

Smuggler's blues

But as you can see, I am obsessed with filling out all the tags. I
don't want to use the grouping for the label because I would have to
change 900+ tags.

Good but not good enough. LOL

I need lyrics first for these 35 songs in case anyone is bored today.

Sailors and the pilots

Soldiers and the law

The payoffs and the rip-offs

And the things nobody saw

No matter if it's heroin

Cocaine or hash

You got to carry weapons

Cos' you always carry cash

There's lots of shady characters

Lots of dirty deals

Every name's an alias

In case somebody squeals

It's the lure of easy money

It's got a very strong appeal



Perhaps you'd understand it better

Standing in my shoes

It's the ultimate enticement

It's the smuggler's blues

Smuggler's blues



You see it in the headlines

You hear it everyday

They say they're gonna stop it

But it doesn't go away

They move it through Miami

They sell it in L.A.

They hide it up in Telluride

I mean it's here to stay

It's propping up the governments

Of Columbia and Peru

You ask any DEA man

He'll say there's nothing we can do

 From the office of the President

Right down to me and you

Me and you



It's a losing proposition

But one you can't refuse

It's the politics of contraband

It's the smuggler's blues

Smuggler's blues
</PRE>
