<PRE>I downloaded a song from iTunes for my daughter, and it downloaded just fine. Then, when I attached her iPod to iTunes, it wouldn't recognize it... or mine when I tried. I rebooted my computer, still wouldn't recognize the iPods. Rebooted the iPods themselves, and it would recognize them, but I'd have to reboot the iPods each time I wanted to reattach them. Ran the diagnoistics from iTunes - it said that iTunes wasn't connecting to the internet - even though I could get the iTunes store to come up. Ran the various help pages, and while it now recognizes our iPods, it won't sync my iPod to update podcasts, photos, and contacts. I get an &quot;unknown error&quot; message, and then it disconnects my iPod automatically.

I finally resorted to deleting iTunes from my computer, following all their instructions, and am re-downloading iTunes (which, given that we have a slot connection, is going to take over an hour and a half)... and now I'm terrified ... will I have to re-create all my playlists, re-import all my zillions of books an music cds?

does anyone have any idea of what might have happened to corrupt my copy of iTunes so badly? or what to expect when iTunes finished downloading?

Help!
