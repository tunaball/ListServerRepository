The Ety ER-4P/S are great, but they do have their downside. These are canal
phones, meaning that, unlike earbuds, they are inserted directly into the
ear canal. Like Bob, I've grown accustomed to them, but for some this is
intolerable. Unfortunately, it usually requires about a $270 investment to
learn how one reacts to them.

Aside from the comfort factor, there is also the problem of cord
microphonics and occlusion. For an example of problems caused by occlusion,
stick your fingers in your ears and try speaking, chewing, or moving about
the room. The microphonics problem presents itself anytime the cord brushes
something such as your shirt. The noise is mechanically transmitted directly
to the ear. Forget using them during exercise periods.

On the plus side, as Bob mentioned, is the excellent, almost unparalleled
detail provided by the Etys. Sonically, they're a rather mixed bag. There is
an almost total lack of visceral bass (you get no tactile feedback) and the
soundstage is very limited. But the inner detail of the music is amazing.
You no longer hear a simple blend of sound. Instead you hear individual
instruments to a degree most of us haven't experienced before. Words,
particularly mine, don't adequately express this. You can literally
concentrate on a single instrument in an ensemble and follow that musician's
performance.

Another important aspect of the Etymotics is their isolation. They are
better at this than any other headphone, including specifically designed
noise canceling models. They provide a whopping 23db of full spectrum
isolation. But there is a downside to this as well. Most of us actually need
to hear the world around us much of the time. With Etys in place, you won't
hear much of that, including telephones, spouses and doorbells.

As much as I like mine, I find I rarely use them these days and make a point
of never recommending them to budding headphone aficionados. A better choice
for most, and one that emulates the Ety sound to a surprising degree without
the negatives of high cost, discomfort, maintenance and inconvenience, is
the Sony MDR-A44. This is a vertical design and costs a mere $25. This may
sound like heresy to Ety enthusiasts, but I've owned both for sometime now.
The only time I prefer the Etys is when I need their isolation.

Since I've already droned on too long, I'll save headphone amps for another
time. Suffice it to say that they can add a great deal to your iPod
enjoyment by enabling the use of truly excellent headphones. And they don't
have to be large. In fact, one of my favorites is the size of four AAA
batteries, runs on three of them, and lasts for more than 120 hours on a
single set.

Sorry about the length, folks.

Ron
