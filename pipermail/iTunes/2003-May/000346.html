<PRE>I repeat: MacWarehouse.com is selling Brand New 20GB iPods for $294.95.  
I bought two and they gave me a 4 year extended warranty for only $65  
each. $360 each including shipping and 4 years of service for a NEW 20  
GB iPod. That's $40 less than the price of a new 15GB iPod.

Adam,
What about the display on the new ones? The Song name and Artist names  
DO NOT scroll on the old 20. That's a minus since many songs &amp; artist  
names are longer. Do they scroll on the new one?
