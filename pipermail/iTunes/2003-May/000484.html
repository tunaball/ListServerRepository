<PRE>Henri-

I've experienced two &quot;problems&quot; with the new iPods: the &quot;tick&quot; between songs
and the sensitive buttons.

The tick is barely audible, but it vexes me nonetheless. According to some
who claim to have Apple inside information, this will be fixed in an
upcoming firmware release.

The button sensitivity issue is another matter. As you likely know, these
aren't really buttons at all in the usual sense. They are actually touch
sensors and operate like the track pad on a laptop or the scroll wheel on
second generation iPods. Because they don't provide the tactile feedback of
conventional buttons, I found I was often pressing them more than once
thinking--because of the usual delay between clicking and the resultant
action--that my first touch didn't take. Now that I've learned how they
respond, I find I actually prefer them.

Regarding OSX and the use of the CLI, I'd venture that at least 80 percent
of OSX users never use it. It's simply not necessary. Honestly, it's a
superb, incredibly stable operating system that I recommend to even rank
beginners. It's certainly much easier to get aboard than previous Mac OS
versions. As for troubleshooting, all I've ever required is Disk Warrior and
David Pogue's book &quot;OSX: The Missing Manual.&quot;
