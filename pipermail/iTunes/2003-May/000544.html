<PRE>To Share Or Not To Share, That Is The Question?

Since when is listening - not downloading - to someone else's songs 
while visiting their list a violation of the right of any music owner 
to share his/her music with others? Apple gave us this technology a 
month ago and those of us who are fortunate enough to have a copy are 
not likely to be doing any upgrades to 4.0.1 or anything higher anytime 
soon - like NEVER.

I think that the sharing of playlists among friends can only enhance 
the iTunes Store's attraction. We get to discover new songs we didn't 
know existed and can understand them in more than a 30 second snippit 
enough to want to buy them. I don't see the downside. It is unfortunate 
that the recording industry is so unnecessarily paranoid about fair 
use. Every time they get their brains in a twist, they shoot themselves 
in the foot. Playlist Stream Sharing is a way to sell more songs, just 
as is radio. Short sidedness is retroactive and retardes the 
development of both internet and music media.

I only wish Steve had pitched the advantages of personal internet 
stream sharing instead of caving into the myopic industry pressure 
cookers who are clueless about what drives sales. It's not only word of 
mouth and 30 second clips. It's a first listen to a complete song that 
the listener wants enough to buy for repeat listens. Thanks for the 
opportunity to share Apple. There are some of us who will keep 4.0 and 
share the wealth - FOREVER.
