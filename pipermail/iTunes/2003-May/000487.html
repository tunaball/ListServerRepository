<PRE>Yes. Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) turns out to be the only way to make 
iPods Jaguar boot-able. I learned the hard way. After numerous installs 
of a boot-able 9 and a hanging 10.2.1 or 10.2.6 I finally got 
frustrated and called a leading expert on the subject of iPods who 
happens to be a neighbor. Chris Breen author of the Peachpit Press book 
&quot;Secrets of the iPod&quot; told me this morning that you have to use CCC to 
get Jaguar to boot from an iPod. He says Apple isn't saying why. So I 
spent this evening building a new &quot;perfect&quot; OS X .2.6 with all the 
goodies I want on my Pod.

I'm new to the Pod. Took advantage of both the MacWarehouse.com $295 - 
20's and the Dell $404 - 30's last week. Working on the 20's right now. 
So a perfect 9.2.2 is done directly and then CCC makes adding OS X a 
piece of cake. If I'd only known what I know now . . .

Between all the goodies and both systems, it's about 2 GB. So you will 
still be able to put a lot of songs on that 5. Anyone who doesn't use 
their iPod as a personal portable Mac boot drive is overlooking one of 
its main attributes. No matter where you go, if there's a Mac in the 
house, you can make it your own with nothing more than your customized 
system's iPod and a FW cable. Also, the beauty of the &quot;Old&quot; models is 
that they run with a standard FW cable and that they also can relate 
musically to the laggard's OS 9 iTunes 2.0.4.

New iPods do not work in 9 except as boot disks. There are an awful lot 
of OS 9 die hards out there. I'm sure the majority of Mac users are 
still using 9. Many of them don't want to spend the money it takes to 
upgrade their library of software and to pay for OS X. I went to a 
dealer last night and he is still entering his FileMaker Pro Database 
of customers in 9 even though the same database will work in X. Go 
figure.
