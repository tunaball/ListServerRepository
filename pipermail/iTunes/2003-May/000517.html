I thought Eric just made pretty clear that the songs being sold through 
the AMS is secure.  Unless they're going to ask Apple to protect all of 
their music from CDs which seems silly.  Are they going to ask Apple to 
remove file sharing from OSX cause I could easily share my library via 
regular file sharing.

Classic case of making a mountain out of a molehill.  I find it 
interesting that the official Apple line was to choose to blame the 
relatively small #'s of people using the streaming feature over the 
Internet instead of the appearance of apps that took advantage of the 
daap protocol to actually download the streams.  Has no one heard of 
Shoutcast?  Or the Quicktime Streaming Server?  Where's the big hoopla 
over them?  You think people haven't already found a way to download 
Shoutcast streams?  It's just a shame that Apple seems to have 
prematurely shot themselves in the foot on a feature that they could've 
studied and fixed with probably not too much effort.
