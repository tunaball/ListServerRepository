I actually really hated the new ones at first because of the  
touch-sensitive buttons. After using it for a little while, though at  
the Apple Store I actually started to get used to it. It does take some  
getting used to, but it's not really any worse, although it does seem  
like you could accidentally hit them a lot. I really don't like the  
scrollpad, but they had those on the old 20 gigs as well, and the new  
scrollpads are definitely better than the ones on the 2nd Gen iPods.  
The wheel on the 1st gen 5 and 10 gigs was just completely perfect. I  
also don't like that the middle button is touch sensitive on the new  
ones; it just feels really strange.

The On-The-Go playlists and being able to rate songs on the new iPods  
are awesome features, but it definitely doesn't make it worth replacing  
your old 20 gig iPod. The only reason I could see for upgrading is if  
people have a 5 or 10 gig and they disparately need the extra space.


&gt;<i> I'm trying to decide between another 20 or a new 10 for my DJ work. Is  
</I>&gt;<i> the brief pause still apparent between tracks in the new model? Or do  
</I>&gt;<i> you not listen to electronica compilations that are intended to be  
</I>&gt;<i> heard without pauses between tracks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I assume it still has the pause because it still always has to access  
the hard drive for a second to access the next song. I haven't actually  
tested this though.

&gt;<i> I love the standard FW port on the &quot;old&quot; models. I don't like the  
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary slot connector on the BOTTOM of the new ones because it is  
</I>&gt;<i> inaccessible when the iPod is in its case. But the new slot connector  
</I>&gt;<i> may have hidden capabilities like audio IN that Apple isn't telling us  
</I>&gt;<i> about yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, new cases are definitely going to have to be made for the new  
ones; remember, the buttons are in a completely different placement  
too, so any iPod case that exposed the buttons and wheel is going to  
have to be redone for the new ones. Apple is already using the new  
connector for other stuff. Belkin makes a $59 battery pack that fits in  
there that provides up to 12-15 hours on standard AA batteries, which  
would be extremely useful.

The new iPods are definitely nice, but it's definitely not worth  
replacing an old one with one of the new ones unless you really need  
the space.
