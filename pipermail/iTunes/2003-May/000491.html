<PRE>Warning: This assumes you have a broadband connection to the internet. 
Without one, this is almost impossible to do correctly and up to date. 
My tweaked update folder full of downloads is 280 MB small. The tweaked 
for the Pod partition is 1.87 GB. It was only 1GB after the 10.2.1 
basic install. ; ^ ) Of course your setup will be different. But there 
are a lot of updates and downloads that make broadband an important 
part of today's internet lifestyle essential. Dial-up is just not a 
practical way of communicating with the world if you are intent on 
being current. And broadband is getting a lot cheaper. SBC now offers 
it for less than $30 a month. I still pay Earthlink $50 a month 
(contract).

I did a virgin 10.2.1 install on a fresh partition I setup on one of my 
empty HDs. NOTE: OfficeMax is selling 8MB buffered WD 7200 RPM 120GB 
HDs this week for $60 after rebate. You need to DEselect all the 
options in the Customize except BSD. That way you do not need disk 2 
and don't install all the obsolete versions of iTunes, iMovie, and 
iPhoto. This only take 1GB of space. Then you build out this new system 
with all the updaters 10.2.6 Combo, QT 6.2, Java 1.4.1, Safari v74, IE 
5.2.2 etc. and third party tricks like LiteSwitch X, ASM, Minimize In 
Place, TigerLaunch etc. whatever you like. Tweak it to the way you like 
it. Takes me a couple of hours to tweak a new system to the point where 
it is the way I want it. Apple leaves so much to do to get it right. 
But that's half the fun right?

Meanwhile, I used the 1.3 iPod updater to put the iPod back to empty 
new (the songs are still on your Mac's HD right? So putting them back 
on after the systems is no big whoop.) and installed 9.2.2 from a CD I 
have of that system first. Customized that install to minimize 
unnecessary parts of the regular install. Then spent a couple of hours 
tweaking that baby up to current snuff. You have to run the updater 
about 6 times before all the updates are complete on a new 9.2.2 
install. They invented quite a few new libraries and airport and 
applescript updates since the last 9.2.2 install disk rolled off the 
presses. Remember that just because you have run all the updates once 
does not mean you have run all the updates. Each round of updates leads 
to another round of them and so forth. I think it took at least 3 
rounds maybe 6 before the updater finally reported there were no more 
to be run.

Stuffit 7.0.3, IE 5.1.6, LiteSwitch, your own desktop color, fonts etc. 
Finally 9 is just the way you like it. NOTE: it will not reboot from 
there. Hold down the option key on reboot and choose your X startup, 
then choose from the X Startup Disk preference the iPod 9.2.2 and it 
will boot from there. That's why running the System Update from the 
Pod's 9 takes so long. You have to reboot to X first each time you 
really want to boot into the Pod's 9 directly. Pain in the rear. 
Anyway, build out your 9 as far as you like before getting to the 
virgin X you built earlier. All your 9 diagnostic tools etc.

Then when your 9 is perfect, boot into X (not necessarily the perfect 
one). Now comes CCC. Boot that puppy and Make sure everything 
pertaining to X is included (like the invisible files). That's why I 
thinking building a new copy on an empty partition is a good idea. That 
way you don't have to skip the Applications folder of your regular 
system because you are tweaking the new one for the Pod. I even have a 
folder full of downloads of all the current updaters and utilities so I 
can perform them on other's Macs in the field where they usually don't 
have broadband.

After running CCC you will now have an iPod of about 2GB full that has 
both systems up-to-date and looking exactly the way you want them to. 
Add music and you are styling with YOUR Mac in your pocket. You never 
have to put up with anyone else's Mac ever again. Just plug your Pod 
in, run the Startup Disk preference or Control Panel and will be 
looking at YOUR Mac a minute later. Cool. Way cool.

Any more questions?
