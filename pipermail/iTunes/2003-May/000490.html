  So what method did you use to make this super utility 'Pod?

Did  you first set up a partition with OS X and then CCC'd it to the 
pod, then copy the 9 system folder?
Did you have to remove the music first and then put it back?
How did you make an OS X system that small?  How small was it and can 
you make it any smaller?

I love to make my newly acquired 10G load up X with all my 
troubleshooting apps.
