<PRE>The song names have always scrolled if you're playing the song, and the  
artists and albums have never scrolled, and they don't on the new ones  
either. The song names have never scrolled in the list, if that's what  
you mean. The song names only scroll if you're currently playing the  
song. I do think Apple should make the artist and album names scroll  
while listening to a song.

However, the new display is amazing, especially the backlight, and it's  
nice to have the buttons light up. In the pictures it always looked  
like the lights on the buttons were orange, but when I saw one in real  
life, I noticed it's more red than orange.

So yeah, I guess if MacWarehouse is selling them for that cheap, it  
could be worth it. Actually, wait a minute. The 20 gigs aren't around  
anymore. A &quot;brand new&quot; 20 gig would just be the old 20 gig. So what  
exactly are you asking?
