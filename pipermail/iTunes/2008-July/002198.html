No, not that. In your previous post you said (and I copy and paste)

&quot;I spent such a long time organizing my music and audiobooks on my  
hard drive - will this copy every thing to someplace else? we have my  
hd partitioned, with one of them being the data drive; on that drive/ 
partition, I have a folder titled Books and Music - books are in one  
sub-folder and music in another.&quot;

I'm suggesting that your &quot;organizing my music and audiobooks&quot; into a  
folder titled &quot;Books and Music&quot; and locating that on a partitioned HD  
might have confused iTunes, especially when you are trying to recover  
from a corrupted file.

&gt;<i> it worked just fine for several years and many iPods, until last  
</I>&gt;<i> week, when iTunes blew up on me when I downloaded a corrupted song  
</I>&gt;<i> file from iTunes itself.

Yes, but that proves nothing. Everything that breaks had previously  
worked just fine for a period of time before it broke. The point is  
that you now have a problem, and you will have to experiment some to  
find a solution.

&gt;<i> Every thing after that has been trying to get back to where I was  
</I>&gt;<i> the week before that.
</I>
And because you are having such unusual problems simply trying to  
return to where you were before, I am looking for possible causes and  
solutions. Specifically, someone else suggested that you check some  
boxes in preferences that would consolidate your library files. You  
stated you didn't want to because you had worked so hard organizing...

I'm suggesting that with proper backups, you could experiment and try  
these suggestions, confident in the knowledge you could use your  
backup to return to your (current) starting point if the suggestions  
don't work out. Also, I would think that if iTunes moves things around  
in the consolidation procedure and it works properly, you could give  
up your organization to the one iTunes creates. Just a thought. You  
*are* asking for suggestions, after all.

&gt;<i> this is being very frustrating.
</I>
I is being sympathetic with you.
