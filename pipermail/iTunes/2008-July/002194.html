</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Becca:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Under the advanced tab in your menu bar there is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Consolidate Library&quot; item. If you choose this option iTunes will  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> search your hard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drive and copy all iTunes compatiblefiles to your Music Folder.   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now you should go back and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delete these items from other folders where they exist or you will  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have duplicates, one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the music folder and one where-ever iTunes found it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I spent such a long time organizing my music and audiobooks on my  
</I>&gt;<i> hard drive - will this copy every thing to someplace else? we have  
</I>&gt;<i> my hd partitioned, with one of them being the data drive; on that  
</I>&gt;<i> drive/partition, I have a folder titled Books and Music - books are  
</I>&gt;<i> in one sub-folder and music in another. Will this consolidation move  
</I>&gt;<i> everything over to the applications drive/partition where iTunes  
</I>&gt;<i> resides?
</I>
Perhaps your folder system is the source of your troubles. Your  
computer doesn't think like you do. Imposing a system on iTunes that  
makes sense to you hasn't helped, it may be the problem.

&gt;<i> what if I don't want them there?
</I>
I suppose it depends upon what is important to you, your personal  
filing system or the proper functioning of iTunes.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2.  If you don't have too many, simply click on the exclamation point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and iTunes will ask you if you want to find the file.  Click &quot;yes&quot;  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> navigate to the proper file.  When you find it, select
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it and click &quot;open&quot; and it will be added to your library.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> how do I know where to find the podcasts?
</I>
You can do a search for them. XP has a search function.

&gt;<i> becca, feeling really stupid and overwhelmed at the chaos this  
</I>&gt;<i> problem has caused
</I>
You really should have a good backup. If you do, you should be able to  
experiment with these suggestions, and be able to return to your  
previous setup if you don't like the results. I know I can do that  
with my Mac. There is software to clone my entire hard drive, so that  
I have a total, complete and accurate copy (definition of a clone, I  
suppose) of my hard drive. Then, when I install new software or make  
some big changes, I am confident that if it all turns to crap, I can  
simply revert to my backup and erase the mistake and begin again.

The iTunes preferences/advanced allow you to specify and/or change the  
location of your iTunes Library folder. Everything that iTunes needs  
to access should be in that folder for optimum functioning. I allow  
iTunes to arrange the files as it wishes, and I don't encounter the  
problems you seem to be having. This whole saga reminds me of a  
Chinese proverb:

If you continue to do what you've always done,
You will continue to get what you've always gotten.

I would also suggest you consider Macintosh the next time you shop for  
a computer. I've used both, and I wouldn't own a PC anymore. My  
reasons have to do with Window's non-intuitive filing system and the  
difficulty in accomplishing what should be simple tasks.

Good luck with this, be sure to share how you finally overcome the  
problem.
