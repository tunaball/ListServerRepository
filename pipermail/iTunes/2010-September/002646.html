I do have a little music there but I could just delete that.  Hmmmm. Okay I can try that. It will probably take some tweaking. Many of the books go into the book folder automatically. I'd need to move all of them. I have 85 GBs of books in the book folder now.

Here's what you could do:

Create a playlist called New Books (or whatever you want). When you add books to iTunes, click on that playlist, then drag the files there.

For each person who wants to sync books, then drag the new books to their playlists. Choose which playlists you sync from the iPod settings Books tab. When you're finished listening to a book, delete it from your playlist.

85 GB is not a lot. I have 350 GB in my iTunes library, with some 55,000 tracks. I think the issue is probably the fact that iTunes has to read the files to get the covers to display, and audiobook files are much bigger than music files.. If you were to display in list view, it would probably be faster (if you don't display the covers).
