<PRE>I have an iPod mini, and my daughter has an iPod Shuffle+hp. I
use my mini to listen to audio books: she uses her Shuffle to
listen to music. we're running Windows XP.

I've got a couple of questions.

1) can I disconnect the iPod Shuffle from the USB port where
it's charging simply by disconnecting it, or do I have to do a
software disconnect first, like I do with my mini?

2) Even though I've got her music separated from my books by
assigning it all to the genre &quot;Tori's music&quot;, it's all jumbled
up in one library. Is there some way we can have 2 separate
libraries?

3) when I start up iTunes (which I *loathe* with a passion) and
her Shuffle is connected for charging, I get a warning saying
that her iPod is connected to another library and do I want to
switch it to this library and update all the files? I say no,
and then iTunes is up but I can't see her iPod as being
connected in order to do the software disconnect. This is
confusing me terribly, because all her music is quite clearly
visible in the iTunes library - and I don't want to say yes and
have my books automatically loaded on her shuffle (although I
thought I had the preferences set to not automatically load, so
I am really confused about why I'm getting this warning in the
first place.)

any help would be gratefully received!
