I'm sorry, but I don't. I don't know what sort of computer you are  
using, or what operating system. I don't know what version of iTunes  
you are using. I don't know what steps you take to &quot;naming CDs that I  
want to burn&quot;. I don't know what sort of source material you are  
burning to a CD, and where it came from and what format it is in. I'm  
guessing you are trying to make audio CDs, but you don't even say  
that specifically.

What have you got. What exactly do you do. What exactly do you get?  
What are you hoping to get?

Did the music files come from ripped CDs? From files purchased  
through the itunes store?

When I burn an audio CD from a play list made up of MP3 files that I  
got from ripping commercial CDs that I own, the iTunes application  
goes online and finds the names of the tracks, artists, album and  
inserts that info for me. That info is also transmitted to the CDs  
that I used to burn. I never needed to &quot;name a CD&quot;.

Better questions get better answers.
