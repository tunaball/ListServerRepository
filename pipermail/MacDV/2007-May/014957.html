<PRE>This may not be on the mark but it might work, I am not an iMovie  
expert, I simply keep trying stuff  and if it works, fine though I  
won't know why.

Think of edits to the video this way. When you add a transition, and  
the transition is 2 seconds long, it consumes about 2 seconds of the  
video but not of the audio of the V.O. The V.O. is going to run  
longer than the video, the more so with more and more video edits.

Just something to try,

Go to the iMovie help and type in   split audio
Then go split the audio

Next, lock the V.O. audio at each video segment.
To lock audio, go to iMovie help and type in     lock audio

This should keep the sync accurate on a video segment by video  
segment basis and not let the sync get worse as the combined effect  
of transitions add up.

If you were having trouble with the audio that was made during the  
movie, switching to the timeline, selecting all and doing an extract  
audio under the Advanced menu seems to lock audio to the video  
segment by segment.
