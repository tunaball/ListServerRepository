<PRE>Hi Mary Ann,

I'm Cc'ing this to you directly as the server seems wonky, taking 
two weeks to respond to posts.

You are absolutely right -- go with MiniDV tape if you plan to 
import and edit.

The HD and flash memory cameras are small, give good pictures, 
and are convenient. HOWEVER, they have onboard hardware to 
compress the video, and it is HIGHLY compressed. No problem as 
far as the pictures go, they look great. But your computer 
doesn't have the dedicated hardware that is built into the 
cameras. So even just playing the footage needs a much more 
powerful machine than it takes to play miniDV. The computer has 
to decompress the video, and then play it as you edit. Huge 
burden on the computer. And realistically, anything over one 
track (effect, titles, etc.) will all have to be rendered. 
Nothing effect wise will be real time any more, because of all 
the computation needed.

Also, while copying files from HD/flash camera is faster than 
ingesting tape, in many, many cases you will have to 
convert/transcode the files in order to use them with your 
editing software. A time consuming hassle.

MiniDV will be the nimblest, most efficient in post production.

P.S. On your DVD question, yes, paper labels cause lots of 
problems as you've discovered. We use a Primera Bravo II DVD 
printer, $2500; and an Epson Disc Publisher, about $4000. We are 
happier with the Epson. We haven't had the Epson long enough to 
calculate, but we figure DVDs with a picture and text cost us 
about 50 cents each just in ink. It is not cheap. Thermal 
transfer printers have a much lower running cost, but an even 
higher initial purchase cost.

Does your school's art department have silk screening capability? 
If so, maybe get the art students to do the DVD labels? Just a 
thought...
