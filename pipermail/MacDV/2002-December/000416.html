<PRE>Hi there,
	I was wondering if anyone could share any insight on which Hard 
drives work well with iMovie.  I'm a little bit disillusioned with this 
video editing thing, as I can't seem to do what I thought I'd be able to 
do.  I bought a Canon ZR10 to use with iMovie on my Clamshell iBook.  I 
needed more than the 10Gigs available on the iBook, and had read that I 
should get a 7200RPM FW HD to avoid dropped frames.
	I wanted something semi-portable, and shelled out for a QPS Que!M3 
100GB 7200RPM Drive about 6 months ago.  I thought I'd be set with a 
fast firewire drive with that much storage space.  To my dismay, it 
hasn't worked well for movie editing at all.  The biggest problem is 
trying to edit with iMovie.  I really can't get any work done because I 
can't seem to empty the trash in iMovie after cropping film.  The hard 
drive just makes my system hang.  It is interesting, because I can make 
it come back to life for a few seconds by plugging the camcorder into 
the other firewire port on the hard drive, but it just ends up hanging 
again.

Anyone had similar experiences?  Is it the drive, or do I need to format 
differently?
If it is my drive, what are some better brands that will work well with 
iMovie?

Any help is appreciated

P.S. I'm running OS X.1.5 on a 466 MHz G3 iBook with 320 MB RAM
