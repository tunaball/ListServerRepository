<PRE>This a problem which I had on my old B&amp;W G3 and it had a number of 
causes.  The major cause seemed to be the bus which the extra drive was 
attached to.  I originally installed the extra drive as a slave to the 
main drive and I could not get past the problem you are reporting.  I 
installed a new ATA card in one of the PCI slots and attached the extra 
drive to it and that did the trick.  Also make certain that the energy 
saver is turned off as well as all other applications.  De-fragmenting 
the drive which contains the video files will also be helpful.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The Disk responded slowly. It may have been interrupted by something,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I carefully avoided having any other applications enabled. I also

</I>&gt;<i> that many audio clips in addition to the video sound track. This 
</I>&gt;<i> really did
</I>&gt;<i> not cause much of a problem while editing. I just continued on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, the real problem is that I have been unable to export this 
</I>&gt;<i> video,
</I>&gt;<i> cut into two parts, each less than an hour, to Mini DV tape in my 
</I>&gt;<i> Canon GL
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The export process just stopped and only once did I get a message 
</I>&gt;<i> and,
</I>&gt;<i> yes, it was the very same message quoted above. When I tried again, the
</I>&gt;<i> process stopped at another place in the movie. I could not figure out 
</I>&gt;<i> how to
</I>&gt;<i> restart at the spot of the interruption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe I have slow disk. I have successfully exported many 
</I>&gt;<i> iMovies
</I>&gt;<i> from that disk. I first experienced the problem using OS 9.1 and hoped 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> OS X would cure the problem but not so. I was also unable to export 
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> movie to Mini DV tape using my wife's more recent iMac. I was able to 
</I>&gt;<i> export
</I>&gt;<i> to her writable DVD drive, however.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone experienced this problem or have any ideas of how to fix it?
</I>&gt;<i> Could it be the length of this movie? Or have I somehow corrupted the 
</I>&gt;<i> iMovie
</I>&gt;<i> software?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will be most grateful for any suggestions.
