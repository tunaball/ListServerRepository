<PRE>
Paul,
If you are doing this for home video and not for a living, you may have more time than
money.  From what I have learned, you can probably do all or most of what you need to in
iMovie, QT Pro, and some other low cost programs.  I went through this awhile back, and
after exhaustive research, learned that I could do most of what I wanted to do in iMovie,
if I was willing to spend a lot of time doing some things that a professional program
could do easily.  The titling program was also too limited for me, and there seemed to be
a program file corruption problem in iMovie that may very well be corrected now.  (No
program is without its issues.)  The learning curve was much greater in Adobe Premiere,
and I am glad I went through it, because there are simple things I can do that- to me-
would be a hassle to do in iMovie.
There are a number of iMovie2 books on the market.  You might want to go to a big
bookstore that might carry more than one, Borders, for one, and check them out, and
choose the one that works best for you.  One that I have and like is David Pogue's.
Good luck

</PRE>
