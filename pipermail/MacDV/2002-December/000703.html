<PRE>Any opinion on the new Canon 8000 scanner, as to  how well it scans 35mm
slides?
Thanks.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> per slide (at full resolution, but without any of the additional processing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that can make it take 10 times that).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think I have mentioned here before that I have about 10,000+ slides to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scan,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I've been trying to figure out if there is any possible way to do this in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a reasonable amount of time.  I don't necessarily need absolutely optimal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quality and resolution--just scans that look good on a computer screen (e.g.,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a screensaver that zooms in on part of the picture), TV screen (e.g., slide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> show video with appropriate music and/or narration), and perhaps a print of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to 8x10 inches.  A 4 megapixel image would be sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To scan a large collection of slides, there seem to be a few alternatives:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Use a flatbed scanner.  This is slow (3-8 minutes per slide), and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quality may not be as good as a slide scanner.  However, for me it would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;free&quot;, since I already have the scanner.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Use a slide scanner.  This is only slightly less slow (1 minute per slide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a $1200 firewire scanner; slower on a cheaper or USB scanner).  This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would probably yield the best quality, if an expensive (&gt;$1000) scanner is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Use a miniDV camcorder: Blast through the slides, filming off of a screen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or transfer box, and extract images from the video.  This would also be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;free&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for me, since I have a camcorder, and would be much faster than the other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways: about 2 seconds per slide to shoot the video, and another few seconds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> per slide to save each slide from the video stream (or perhaps done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automatically).  But the quality would be nasty: 640x480 and highly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compressed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Use a digital camera: Project each slide onto a movie screen or transfer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> box, and use a 4 megapixel digital camera to snap off each picture.  This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would probably take 3-5 seconds per picture (assuming the digital camera
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> store things off that quickly), and would be high enough resolution for most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things.  I need to experiment to see how the quality compares with a slide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scanner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there such a thing anywhere (even for $100,000) as a scanner that will do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fast high-quality scans of slides?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What your time is worth? A few years ago I spent $600 (CND) on an HP
</I>&gt;<i> Photosmart S20 scanner for my Dad with the intent of archiving thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> family slides/negs. By the time all was said and done, we were lucky to come
</I>&gt;<i> out with maybe 25 scans in a hour (and of course that doesn't include time
</I>&gt;<i> to catalog, backup data, etc.). It was totally discouraging, and to be
</I>&gt;<i> honest, the quality wasn't that great.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Previously we had sent several hundred slides in to a Kodak Photo CD shop;
</I>&gt;<i> awesome quality, no muss, no fuss, and they had 300 slides done in less than
</I>&gt;<i> a week. It seemed a little pricey at the time (about $1/slide) which is why
</I>&gt;<i> I went the scanner route, but in retrospect I should have saved my money on
</I>&gt;<i> the scanner, and countless hours of time, and just had them all done to
</I>&gt;<i> Photo CD. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My advice - take them to a service bureau that does Kodak Photo CD/Picture
</I>&gt;<i> CDs and spend your time/money on the creative side of things.
