<PRE>AMEN.  I just inventoried 3000 negs to scan.  I called a big photo store in 
my area and first they said $1.19 for photocd.  Then the lady asked if I 
was in a hurry, if not I could have them for $.50 each.  I dropped my 
shopping for the scanner and decided to get a Nikon d100 instead.
IF you only require web res there are places that would do it for a good 
price.  Maybe send some out and do some?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is that while the Epson 2450 is the fastest flatbed scanner 
</I>&gt;<i> I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; heard of (17 seconds for a 6x4&quot; print at 600dpi, for example), it is still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; painfully slow on transparent scans (3-7 minutes per slide).  The Super
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Coolscan slide scanner is suppsed to be &quot;fast&quot;, but still takes about a 
</I>&gt;<i> minute
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; per slide (at full resolution, but without any of the additional processing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that can make it take 10 times that).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think I have mentioned here before that I have about 10,000+ slides 
</I>&gt;<i> to scan,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I've been trying to figure out if there is any possible way to do 
</I>&gt;<i> this in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a reasonable amount of time.  I don't necessarily need absolutely optimal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quality and resolution--just scans that look good on a computer screen 
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a screensaver that zooms in on part of the picture), TV screen (e.g., slide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; show video with appropriate music and/or narration), and perhaps a 
</I>&gt;<i> print of up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to 8x10 inches.  A 4 megapixel image would be sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To scan a large collection of slides, there seem to be a few alternatives:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Use a flatbed scanner.  This is slow (3-8 minutes per slide), and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quality may not be as good as a slide scanner.  However, for me it would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;free&quot;, since I already have the scanner.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Use a slide scanner.  This is only slightly less slow (1 minute per 
</I>&gt;<i> slide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a $1200 firewire scanner; slower on a cheaper or USB scanner).  This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would probably yield the best quality, if an expensive (&gt;$1000) scanner is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Use a miniDV camcorder: Blast through the slides, filming off of a 
</I>&gt;<i> screen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or transfer box, and extract images from the video.  This would also be 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;free&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for me, since I have a camcorder, and would be much faster than the other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ways: about 2 seconds per slide to shoot the video, and another few seconds
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; per slide to save each slide from the video stream (or perhaps done
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automatically).  But the quality would be nasty: 640x480 and highly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compressed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. Use a digital camera: Project each slide onto a movie screen or transfer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; box, and use a 4 megapixel digital camera to snap off each picture.  This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would probably take 3-5 seconds per picture (assuming the digital 
</I>&gt;<i> camera could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; store things off that quickly), and would be high enough resolution for 
</I>&gt;<i> most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things.  I need to experiment to see how the quality compares with a slide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scanner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there such a thing anywhere (even for $100,000) as a scanner that 
</I>&gt;<i> will do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fast high-quality scans of slides?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What your time is worth? A few years ago I spent $600 (CND) on an HP
</I>&gt;<i>Photosmart S20 scanner for my Dad with the intent of archiving thousands of
</I>&gt;<i>family slides/negs. By the time all was said and done, we were lucky to come
</I>&gt;<i>out with maybe 25 scans in a hour (and of course that doesn't include time
</I>&gt;<i>to catalog, backup data, etc.). It was totally discouraging, and to be
</I>&gt;<i>honest, the quality wasn't that great.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Previously we had sent several hundred slides in to a Kodak Photo CD shop;
</I>&gt;<i>awesome quality, no muss, no fuss, and they had 300 slides done in less than
</I>&gt;<i>a week. It seemed a little pricey at the time (about $1/slide) which is why
</I>&gt;<i>I went the scanner route, but in retrospect I should have saved my money on
</I>&gt;<i>the scanner, and countless hours of time, and just had them all done to
</I>&gt;<i>Photo CD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My advice - take them to a service bureau that does Kodak Photo CD/Picture
</I>&gt;<i>CDs and spend your time/money on the creative side of things.
