</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for your account of some of the history of the 8mm movie 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formats.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all the nice comments, and apologies for tons of errors &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> misspellings. I certainly didn't do full fact checking, editing, or 
</I>&gt;<i> freshen
</I>&gt;<i> up my research. These posts were intended as orientation, not a
</I>&gt;<i> comprehensive history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anybody really interested in Super 8 should try to obtain the books 
</I>&gt;<i> written
</I>&gt;<i> by Lenny Lipton. His &quot;Super Eight Book&quot; is excellent both for format
</I>&gt;<i> specifics and historical background.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Foundations of the Stereoscopic Cinema&quot; is also outstanding. Lipton 
</I>&gt;<i> had a
</I>&gt;<i> special interest in stereo movies, and the opportunity presented by 
</I>&gt;<i> Super 8
</I>&gt;<i> to do outstand work, owing to the fact that two small cameras could be
</I>&gt;<i> operated together at near the correct intra-ocular distance, something 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> was impractical and cumbersome with Hollywood-produced 35mm 3D movies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both of these books are very sold on the human physical basis which
</I>&gt;<i> underlies perception of motion. I've never seen anything better. Super 
</I>&gt;<i> 8 is
</I>&gt;<i> dated, but the human body has not changed. For this alone, these books 
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> as good and useful as ever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Amazon has a service to obtain used books. Right now, both these 
</I>&gt;<i> titles are
</I>&gt;<i> out of print, with Amazon listing them at $53.97 for the Super Eight 
</I>&gt;<i> Book,
</I>&gt;<i> and $80.00 for the Stereoscopic Cinema.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every year or two, some Hollywood feature pulls some wild special 
</I>&gt;<i> effect out
</I>&gt;<i> of the hat and amazes everyone. One example: The Matrix. Most of this 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff
</I>&gt;<i> is nearly old hat, only jazzed up by capabilities of computers. I bet 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> two Lipton titles above are prized possessions of most special effects
</I>&gt;<i> wizards in the industry, because they lay a real foundation. As such, I
</I>&gt;<i> think they would benefit people today interested in 3D modeling, even 
</I>&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i> they are just working on common 2D motion graphics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Out of Print&quot; is a term of the past in publishing. Anymore, many 
</I>&gt;<i> titles are
</I>&gt;<i> print on demand. It is a shame that the Lenny Lipton books are out of 
</I>&gt;<i> print.
</I>&gt;<i> Out of print status, anymore, is more an issue of ownership and 
</I>&gt;<i> copyright
</I>&gt;<i> than anything else. You would think that Lenny Lipton, if he is still
</I>&gt;<i> around, would have no problem making these works available via a print 
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> demand publisher, unless there are entanglements with a publishing 
</I>&gt;<i> contract
</I>&gt;<i> that predates modern technology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW - I served several years as a SMPTE Officer. Each year, SMPTE 
</I>&gt;<i> publishes
</I>&gt;<i> a membership directory, and Lenny Lipton's name was always there. My
</I>&gt;<i> membership lapsed in a computer snafu at SMPTE, and I've never 
</I>&gt;<i> re-upped, but
</I>&gt;<i> any current SMPTE members on the list might check their most recent
</I>&gt;<i> directory, and see if there is contact info on Lipton.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other odd-ball writer who is fun to read is Mark Schubin in 
</I>&gt;<i> Videography.
</I>&gt;<i> His articles tend towards free-association of engineering facts, 
</I>&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;<i> like the PBS series &quot;Connections&quot; peppered with obscure &amp; esoteric
</I>&gt;<i> historical footnotes. I like to read his stuff, and sometimes 
</I>&gt;<i> understand it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lenny Lipton's writing style is very clear, easy to approach for 
</I>&gt;<i> beginners,
</I>&gt;<i> and fast moving. Besides his work writing about filmmaking, he is also 
</I>&gt;<i> known
</I>&gt;<i> for writing the song, &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon&quot; -- either a child's 
</I>&gt;<i> fairy tale
</I>&gt;<i> or a anthem to dope smoking, whichever way you want to look at it. You 
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> never associate the author of such fantasy lyrics with the author of 
</I>&gt;<i> first
</I>&gt;<i> rate filmmaking books with factual basis to satisfy any engineer, but 
</I>&gt;<i> it is
</I>&gt;<i> one and the same man.
