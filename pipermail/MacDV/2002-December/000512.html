<PRE>To do the job you speak of, to the highest standard I've heard of for 
dojo videos, would require about 2% of the power of FCP, and, with the 
Apple mpeg-2 codec for DVD Studio Pro, you'd be absolutely fine for 
mastering your DVD. No need for the other programs.

Most limiting factors in this type of production involve the potential 
mismatching of the Digital 8 and DV Camcorders in terms of look. FCP's 
Color Correction can easily fix most color or exposure differences, but 
detail as well can be an issue. One exceptional addition to a video of 
this sort would be FCP's ability to do very good slo mo effects, which 
would expand the look of ordinary camcorder footage. Adding some simple 
lighting would also make a big difference. A caveat as to exposure 
would be if the dojo walls were white or very light in color. This 
would tend to cause the automatic exposure of the cameras to darken 
your subject. It may be hard to avoid if no manual exposure option is 
available, and manual exposure should not be used if you are not used 
to it. While video purists would perhaps shun the idea, you can &quot;pull 
up&quot; dark video in the 3-Color Corrector pretty easily, and it will play 
well on home TV's.

Lighting the video might help a lot, both in making the action look 
better, and in controlling things like a white wall for a background. 
Let me know if you'd be interested in any tips.

In terms of later editing, it would also be advisable to do some form 
of visual slate (even a hand clap) prior to the starting of filming 
which is clearly read on both cameras. This will allow a nonlinear form 
of B-roll checkerboard editing that will allow you to best use the two 
camera views in the least amount of time. What might happen, however, 
over a long take, is some slight potential drift between the shots. As 
you will be cutting between the shots, you can fix any error at the 
point of making the given cut. It should be a piece of cake.

The real problem with dojo videos is the tendency of always shooting 
everything as a full shot in an effort to catch all the action. While 
this will show technique, not doing a little more coverage will make 
for a typically dry edit. Consider shooting, at LEAST for segue 
purposes, interesting medium shots or close-ups, perhaps telegraphing 
the next technique to come.

Good shooting,

Richard Brown
