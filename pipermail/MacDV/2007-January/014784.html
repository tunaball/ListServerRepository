<PRE>A followup question. I have been reading posts on MacDV for quiet  
some time. I learn a lot and is quiet enjoyable. I use iMovie a bunch  
and usually use two cameras for shoots I do. One is a Sony VX2000 and  
the other is a DSR250. I'm always editing between the two cameras and  
use audio to sync by. I am pretty good with audio. However, I do not  
know how to use time stamping or sync the time on my cameras to make  
it easier for me. Particularly when there is a lot of music involved  
with close-up shots from the two different cameras. I painstakingly  
make sure the video movements (lip and speech patterns) are the same  
when I edit from one clip to another from the different cameras. I am  
pretty good with this too but it takes a lot of tedious frame by  
frame editing and time. Is there a way to do time stamping or capture  
syncing with iMovie. Like I said, I am a musician, pretty good with  
audio (use some other app's to help me enhance audio) and am pretty  
good with iMovie. After about 3 years using iMovie I am getting ready  
to graduate to Final Cut Express. Is it easier to do in FC Express?  
Any pointers, tips, tutorials, suggested reading, books, online  
articles appreciated. Thanks a bunch!!!! -Chuck Kay

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've been in a similar situation before, but used the DV timecode

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> three independent cameras. I had available the hr/min/sec/frame on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each clip and the &quot;capture&quot; (=shooting not import) time of the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start of each clip as hr/min/sec.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unless you synced the time on the cameras before you started there  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be a difference. Once you identify a point in time shot  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simultaneously from both cameras you can use the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;capture&quot; (=shooting) time suitably adjusted to align clips  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> roughly, and if it looks OK it will do. If not, shift it by up to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a second's worth of frames in one direction or the other and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preview again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pity about the sound missing, it helps a lot, although sometimes  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it can still look wrong even when you know it must be right.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry can't help with the FCP question, but I hope this helps.
