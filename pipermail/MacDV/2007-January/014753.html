<PRE>I think I am going to go the easy way out with the few 8mm we have and have
them done at a little place not far from here.
    Did you have any trouble with the actual iMovie to iDVD process and
burn?   I like the method you mentioned since I am such a newbie with all of
this I would have not known which method to use.  I don't think I will
bother with music at least for a while, since I tend to do a talking
monologue I think It would just add more time at this part of the process.
Were there other snafus that you worked around?  What brand bland DVD's did
you use?
    I have a very very newbie question.  Once you have burned a DVD and it
is not full can you burn more on it later or that you get?
    Thanks David you give me hope!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This thing has all the ports you would ever need for analog to
</I>&gt;<i> digital or digital to analog. So the basic setup for the VHS tapes was:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> VCR-&gt;Canopus Box-&gt;Output FireWire to Mac into iMovie
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the 8mm tapes, that was a harder story, because I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> where you live, but it was a real pain trying to find an 8mm
</I>&gt;<i> camcorder, or a digital one that also played 8mm tapes. We finally
</I>&gt;<i> found one at a local Circuit City, so we bought it. Then the setup
</I>&gt;<i> for the 8mm tapes became:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Digital/8mm Camcroder -&gt;  FireWire to Mac in iMovie. So essentially,
</I>&gt;<i> the older 8mm tape would play on the Digital/8mm camera, and be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;converted to digital&quot; as it left that camera via FIreWire. This was
</I>&gt;<i> extremely helpful, because otherwise we would have had to go through
</I>&gt;<i> the Canopus box again, or cable the older 8mm camera to the ZR10, and
</I>&gt;<i> record on the ZR10, then go back rewind and import into iMovie with
</I>&gt;<i> the ZR10 (you can't import into iMovie while the video is being
</I>&gt;<i> recorded on the ZR10). So finding that old &quot;combo&quot; camera was a real
</I>&gt;<i> saver. I can't remember which model it was (we returned it after we
</I>&gt;<i> were done &#173; gotta love retail!), but it was a Sony, I remember that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, I forgot to mention we had to buy a combo camera, because
</I>&gt;<i> our Sony Camcorder (big old clunky 8mm one) died, and we couldn't use
</I>&gt;<i> it anymore. Even if we could, though, we would have had to
</I>&gt;<i> essentially repeat the same scenario as the VCR, because the older
</I>&gt;<i> cameras didn't have FireWire digital output.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's my brain dump, feel free to ask any other questions. Though
</I>&gt;<i> taxing timewise, it was a fun project to convert everything, but the
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter Markers in iMovie (that get transfered automatically) are  a
</I>&gt;<i> lifesaver, and it's fun to add music, pick themes, and so on. Adding
</I>&gt;<i> chapters in iMovie is just a matter of advancing through the tape,
</I>&gt;<i> finding the spot where a new chapter should begin (we used the arrow
</I>&gt;<i> keys to advance a frame at a time to get the exact spot, and marking
</I>&gt;<i> the chapter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have fun!
