<PRE>No trouble with iMovie to iDVD process, or the burn. The burns took  
about 2 hours if I didn't use motion menus, 3 hours if I did. Some of  
the iDVD themes use &quot;Drop Zones,&quot; into which you can insert pictures  
or movies &#8211; that's what probably took the most time (my wife and I  
deciding what to put in there!). Other than that, iMovie and iDVD  
really make the job more fun and certainly more tolerable.

We use TDK DVD-R and haven't had 1 problem yet. Once you burn a DVD- 
R, you're done. You can add to a DVD-RW (The &quot;W&quot; is for multiple  
Writes), but at the time I purchased the DVDs, DVD-R was the only  
format iDVD would burn to. That has changed, but I'd still get DVD- 
R's for maximum compatibility. I think I got them at Costco (two  
spools of 100 each for about $50).
