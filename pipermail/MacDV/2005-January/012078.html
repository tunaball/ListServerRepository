<PRE>All,

Sorry if this subject has been covered in the past, if so please direct 
me to the archives.

In the perfect world this is what I'm looking for in a piece of 
software:

  - easy to navigate interface that allows me to organize, search, group 
assets
  - assets stored off-line, perhaps dvd.
  - storage of 'sample' video clip of asset on local HD

Here is how I envision my workflow:

  - shoot to dv tape
  - import dv tape to off-line storage. Currently DVD seems most 
feasible.  Assets must be stored in a 'RAW' format easily accessible by 
today's and any future tools developed in the years ahead.
  - software interface allows easy access to assets stored on DVDs.

I'd really like to touch the DV tape only once, afterwards, the assets 
are stored permanently on some off-line medium which is then managed by 
a software front-end.  I don't believe todays hard drives are large 
enough to permanently and safely store all of the assets one might 
collect over the years.  Additionally, I don't won't to go back to the 
master tape.  I'm thinking  that with my kids and all of the footage 
over the years, I'd like to create a compilation of some sort and 
certainly don't want to re-import off of 10 years worth of DV tape.  In 
ten years, if I want to author a 'best of..' for example, I can compile 
the list of assets that are of interest and determine on which DVD the 
assets can be found.

I have looked at FootTracker in the past.  It seems to do most of what 
I want except I'm not sure about the off-line storage and 'sample' 
video clip requirements.  It is mentioned on their website that 
off-line storage is feasible via DVD, however I'd like others who have 
had experience in the area to comment.  Secondly, I don't want to 
'compress' the entire asset as FootTracker seems to do, just a sample 
so that I can quickly determine if the asset is what I want.

Currently I'm using iMovie, iDVD, etc, however have been look at the 
Pro tools, i.e. FC HD, etc.  Not sure if this makes a difference as I'm 
not sure how the 'import' of assets to the permanent storage device, 
DVD, are easily accessible by todays or even tomorrows video tools.



</PRE>
