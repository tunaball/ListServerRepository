<PRE>
This may not make it on the list, so I am sending you an email also. 

Amount of time for recording also seems to be a concern. 

However, I thought I would relate the experience of friends of mine. A year 
ago I recommended mini DV cameras. They went with DVD. Initially, they were OK 
with it. Said they would NEVER edit. Well, over time they noticed that they 
were not flawless in their videotaping. Like the 5 or 10 seconds of video when 
they did not stop recording and thought they had. Or when the wife did not like 
the way she looked or the teenage daughter was embarrassed by the tape and 
they insisted that that tape could not be shown to anyone. They started to 
realize that a little, simple editing made sense.

They now are thrilled with the new mini DV camera they bought, a Canon ZR 80 
or 90, I think. They also now have an eMac they got back in August and can't 
believe how easy iMovie is to use. The daughter is now editing her new 
creation, a family Holiday video. She loves being able to edit out various scenes. In 
only 3 weeks, the mini DV has become a huge hit. (The Sony DVD camcorder will 
be on eBay soon.)

&gt;<i> One more thing: this camera is fairly expensive for someone just
