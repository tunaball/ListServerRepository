<PRE>Hi Jon

Have no fear that you have chosen badly

Just a few bones :-) no picking though :-D

Make sure the G4 is a Dual Processor Live Channel 2 will use one of 
them and you will need the other for other content programs (photoshop 
ect...) to run at the same time.
All the other kit will work fine as is.
Live Channel Pro 2 is hands down, the best bit of software on any 
platform for live internet edit and broadcast, IMHO. And at $1000 it is 
just so tasty!

As you are coming from a broadcast background be aware that LCP2 
outputs at a resolution of 320 x 240 and anything bigger is scaled from 
that
So if you want to rebroadcast your content via more traditional means 
on pickup, there could be problems on that score
Saying that, if you and your content receiver are willing to take that 
hit, you are saving yourself the financial hit of more traditional 
means.

LCP2 has its own built in broadcast server, if you choose that option, 
announce the server and select compression setting (Broadcast menu) 
your away, thats it!
To optimise your streams you will need some help locally from someone 
who knows video over IP, your knowledge in broadcast will come in handy 
to.
All these settings are in the Broadcast, Unicast and Multicast settings.

As a final note this is a viable option for an on-location producer to 
have unlimited library footage, unlimited live sources, still graphics 
etc... edit them and broadcast them via the internet.
As for the receiver is concerned, as long as the non PAL/NTSC signal is 
workable, via scaling or layover on a graphic at native resolution, 
then fine.
Of course they will need to have the tech knowhow their end to use the 
live Quicktime stream that you are providing, and that's a whole 
different story.

Hope this helps

Alex
