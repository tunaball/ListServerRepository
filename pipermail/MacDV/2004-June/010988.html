<PRE>A friend of mine has one of these Sony DVD camcorders ( model 100 ) 
and it only has S-video and USB 2.0.  I WAs really surprised that is 
had no FW. My friend wants a Mac for video editing but is letting 
this camera get in the way.  I'm not sure how to make it work with a 
Mac, perhaps the USB2.0 equipped Macs would transfer the video to 
iMovie ok??

Also there are 3 levels of video quality.  20min for high, ?? Med, 
and 60min for Low.  He records in low quality just so he can get 
something on his dvd. But the manual does not say what type of signal 
it records.  MPEG2 is what is uses for the photo stills, but it says 
nothing about the video format. He is pretty sure it is NOT MPEG as 
his PC MPEG video editor will not accept it.

I told him to give this camera away to an ignorant PC person and go 
buy a FW equipped mini-DV camcorder  and quit messing around with 
these compatibility issues.  He's been trying to make it work on his 
PC for months now. buying this and that software, extra video import 
hardware etc. Crazy what people will put themselves through when 
Apple has a very simple editing solution. I told him to get an iMac 2 
years ago, and he still has nothing edited with his PC.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Good questions. I would love to learn more about these from those who own
</I>&gt;<i>them. I understand they do not have Firewire ports.
