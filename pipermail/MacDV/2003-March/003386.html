<PRE>You definitely need to post this sort of comment to Apple at the iMovie 
FEEDBACK PAGE before you post it here.
We are powerless to effect change in iMovie 3. You must tell Apple 
engineers what is going on with you. Here's the page you need to copy 
and paste this entire letter to:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/feedback/imovie.html">http://www.apple.com/feedback/imovie.html</A>&gt;

Let me know if you don't want to and I will do it for you.

And that goes for everyone else with specific criticisms about any 
Apple software. Each program has a feedback page on the Apple site. I 
had to lobby two years to get the iTunes engineers to put the &quot;Create 
file names with track number&quot; (Importing Preference Pane) feature back 
into iTunes which was REMOVED when Apple bought SoundJam and turned it 
into an oversimplified iTunes. I am referring to a feature that was in 
SoundJam from DAY ONE. These changes don't come quickly nor easily. You 
have to be persistent and vigilant if you want your pet missing feature 
to get put in. There are a lot of politics involved in getting features 
added to these free Digital Hub programs. Keep in mind that they want 
you to buy FCE or FCP in the long run.

&gt;<i> There are 2 problems with iMovie3 I have noticed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problem 1:
</I>&gt;<i> I have come across a problem when importing additional clips (camera 
</I>&gt;<i> source: Canon XL1) This happens if you have imported clips then 
</I>&gt;<i> editied those clips and then wish to import additional clips after the 
</I>&gt;<i> first set have been editied.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What seems to happen is this. I have imported clips with a limited 
</I>&gt;<i> amount of storage space on my computer. I fill the space that is 
</I>&gt;<i> available (not to the very end) then edit the imported clips. When I 
</I>&gt;<i> empty the trash of the unsed clips I import more of the clips to be 
</I>&gt;<i> edited. As the new clips are imported they are given a clip number. 
</I>&gt;<i> the new clip numbers begin at 1 then 2, then 3 and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Later when I have edited all the clips (first set then second set) and 
</I>&gt;<i> play back the edited film the following starts to happen...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the playhead reaches a point where the clip being played repeats 
</I>&gt;<i> the same clip number as an earlier one. The visual returns to the 
</I>&gt;<i> first clip with that number, but the audio continues as the second 
</I>&gt;<i> clip with that number. (sorry if this is confusing)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I am trying to say is that any time you import new clips and 
</I>&gt;<i> there are no clips in the 'clips pane' the new clips start loading 
</I>&gt;<i> again as 'clip 1' 'clip 2' 'clip 3' and so on. The playback seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> get confussed reading the second set of clip numbers as the first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What would solve the problem would be if any additional clip imports 
</I>&gt;<i> continued being numbered from the last clip import. ie: if the first 
</I>&gt;<i> set of clip imports were numbered 1 to 6 and the next set continued 
</I>&gt;<i> with 7 and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problem 2:
</I>&gt;<i> I have also noticed that when you wish to drop in a clip over an audio 
</I>&gt;<i> extract, a short burst of audio from the dropped-in clip bleeds into 
</I>&gt;<i> the audio, it sounds something like a scratch on the audio track.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried to oversize the clip, then extract the audio, then trim 
</I>&gt;<i> off the start to avoid this, but no luck. Nothing I have been able to 
</I>&gt;<i> do gets me over this problem. Any solutions would be welcomed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My Equipment:
</I>&gt;<i> iMac SuperDrive 800mhz, 512Mb Ram
</I>&gt;<i> Canon XL1 camera
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you,
