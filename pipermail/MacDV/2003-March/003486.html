<PRE>&gt;<i>You probably need to move the iMovie 3 app into the root level of the
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Applications&quot; folder and make sure it's named &quot;iMovie&quot;.  
</I>
I agree with Mark.  That is what I had to do in order for the upgrade to recognize my iMovie3 app.  Curiously, after the upgrade, the app still showed version 3.0.1.  I had to restart in order for Jaguar to see it as 3.0.2., as well as 3rd party plug-ins
to work properly.

More curiously, before I upgraded to 3.0.2, I ran Software Update, and iMovie3.0.2 did not show up.  I think that was because I had renamed the app &quot;iMovie3&quot;.

Anway, I installed the most recent &quot;Security Update&quot; as well as &quot;iCal&quot;.

Prior to these 2 upgrades, Jaguar (10.2.4), and iMovie2 and iMovie3 would not recognize any of my 3 cameras.  Apple System Profiler would read...
FireWire Information:  No FireWire devices found.

After these 2 upgrades, my TRV900 was finally recognized in ASP.  I was finally able to have my camcorder &quot;connected&quot; in both versions of iMovie.  I then ran the iMovie upgrader and now I occassionally have the camera &quot;connected&quot;.  iMovie3.0.2 still has
audio stutter.

I'm running...
G3 Powerbook
333 MHz
512 RAM
VST Firewire Cardbus Card

I just ordered a SmartDisk Firewire Cardbus Card because it has 3, 6pin ports and includes power connector for robust bus-powering of FireWire devices (superior to cards offering only 4-pin &quot;non-powered&quot; ports).  I hope this is the solution, otherwise I
may have to buy a newer computer.
