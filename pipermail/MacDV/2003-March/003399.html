<PRE>O.K., here's my request to Apple, so tell me what you all think.  If you've
purchased the premium product, DVD Studio Pro, that has the drivers/plug-ins
and licensing &quot;hooks&quot; for third party drives, give us a 'special version' of
iDVD for quick one-off DVDs as part of a bundle.  How's that sound?

As for the idea that Apples got their hands tied by other industry/business
considerations and that precludes them from building in third-party drive
support, I don't fully buy that.  It's the same argument the PC vendors use
to NOT include firewire on their boxes but do include USB 2.0--it's all
marketing and relationships (and in the case of Apple, they just want to
leverage iDVD and built-in SuperDrives as a 'point of difference solution'
for new equipment sales.)  The firewire licensing is pennies per port,
folks.  How much exactly is the MPEG licensing?

IDVD does what it does and does it on only built-in Apple drives.  Making it
work with other DVD-R equipment does nothing to alter it's basic
functionality nor it's user base...they're still Mac users.  There's no
bearing on the content protection issues or more than a savings of a few
dollars per copy of the program that I can see.  Let ME pay the licensing
fee in the way of a plug-in or special version of iDVD...hey, what about
just building it into this iLife at $49, the stock and packaging over
downloads doesn't fully account for the list price, does it?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On another note, I've always expected the manufacturer of any drive I
