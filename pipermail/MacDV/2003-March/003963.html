<PRE>EyeTV can do simple capture...

If you want to capture a snapshot of the current frame of video, you 
can press &#8984;-C, which will save the picture to the clipboard. Or, you 
can press &#8984;-Shift-C which will create a snapshot file on your desktop 
from the active video window, named &#8220;EyeTVSnapshot_1.jpg&#8221;, 
&#8220;EyeTVSnapshot_2.jpg&#8221; and so on.

The quality is nothing to write home about - you're dealing with some 
pretty blocky stuff. Works for small web reproduction (within 
copyright) though... As far as other comments -

It's really easy to use - like working a TV remote. It integrates 
nicely with Toast for burning to VCD/DVD. You can schedule using 
TitanTV, Yahoo TV, or with Watson. Karelia's Watson is the best - but 
isn't free like the other two. El Gato's Support Team has always been 
responsive to my queries.

Quality is like CABLE TV to VHS - at extended play mode. The colors 
lose some vibrancy and you have a minimal amount of blockiness. It's 
much better than most web video though.

Audio sometimes loses sync. Not really bad - but this is not Canopus. 
Not consistently off - doesn't seem highly affected by processor usage.

Overall - better than a TIVO (until they make it comp. w/Rendezvous) - 
especially since it doesn't collect your personal data. Not in the same 
league as Canopus ADVC -- but then again the Canopus captures raw (read 
GB!) AND doesn't have scheduling software.

Only $200 - well worth it.

Just my thoughts -

&gt;&gt;<i> Can you tell us more about your experience with EyeTV?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How's the quality, the ease of use, etc.?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know where my brain was when I wrote that. I guess it wasn't 
</I>&gt;<i> EyeTV that had the frame grabber. I was using SnapZPro grabbing images 
</I>&gt;<i> WHILE using EyeTV.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It records and saves in MPEG 1 so there is a real problem editing it 
</I>&gt;<i> except they have a minimal editor built in, for editing out 
</I>&gt;<i> commercials.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It compresses one hour of video to 650 megs and it can be saved 
</I>&gt;<i> directly as a CDROM Video to add to your collection if you are so 
</I>&gt;<i> inclined.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's got a tuner embedded in it that acts just like a VCR tuner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Go to www.titantv.com and get the schedule for your cable system for 
</I>&gt;<i> the next two weeks. Click on the programs you want to record. EyeTV 
</I>&gt;<i> activates and records them for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I liked the idea of TiVo but didn't want to buy the box and go into 
</I>&gt;<i> the other room. Now I got it right here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the quality is like cable TV, not digital, but it's as good as any 
</I>&gt;<i> TV set.
</I>&gt;<i>
