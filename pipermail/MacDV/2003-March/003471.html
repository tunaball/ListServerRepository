<PRE>Thanks Steven,
Filipe over at the Mac Pro Audio list gave me the answer. I knew you 
would want to know what it is. This is such an interesting set of 
posts, I'm including the entire chronology. I am so excited I performed 
my first Demux of an embedded MPEG1 Video and successfully extracted 
the MPEG1 Layer 2 audio track and then used iTunes to convert it to a 
96kbps MP3 file. And it was so damned easy. I didn't know what I was 
doing and yet I did it !! UNIX programmers are amazing. Thank GOD for 
Mac OS X and UNIX together at last.

Thanks Filipe,
It says MPEG1 Muxe...
Now I'll try your solution application if I can figure it out without 
any documentation. Oh there's a small read me file. Very complicated &#8212; 
NOT.  Ran the mpgtxwrap app from September aafter installing the 
package. How this miracle of UNIX programming can accomplish all this 
in a 161 K download is astonishing. Apple ought to have those kinds of 
UNIX programmers rewriting iMovie all over again from scratch.

OK. I have an mp3 file thanks to you Filipe. I installed the package 
and ran the Demuxer falwlessly. Took a minute max to Demux by simply 
choosing the MPEG Movie and pressing START. Displays percentage done in 
real time. Then I put the resulting MPEG 1 Layer 2 audio file in 
iTunes, Advanced&#8212;&gt;Convert Selection to mp3 and a couple minutes later 
it resulted in a 96 kbps mp3 file in the Library. It's a miracle. This 
list rocks! Where else can you accomplish do it yourself Demuxing when 
you haven't a clue a half hour before you do it!

I love you Filipe! And every body else who's lurking too. Amazing. 
Simply Amazing!

I'm a born again Demuxer!!

the package you have to install prior to running the app is 140K
The app &quot;mpegtxwrap&quot; 1.1 is 356K

Here's the genius who wrote that tiny miraculous piece of code:

I have to copy him this post. Thank you brilliant MPEG programmer whom 
ever you are.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm stumped. I have downloaded a 55.4 MB 5:34 minute Music Video MPEG 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> movie (i know not what flavor) that plays in QuickTime. But when I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> try to use my QuickTime Pro 6.1 to export the audio as an AIFF file, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I get no option to do that. In fact no audio extraction option is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shown.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right - MPEG audio is like a unfathomable enigma to Quicktime. It 
</I>&gt;<i> plays, but if you do anything with the movie, the audio is history. 
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the edit functions are disabled with MPEG.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  So I downloaded Extractor .95 from the internet and it won't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recognize the MPEG movie as a file it can deal with. I did already 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> export the original MPEG movie as a QuickTime Movie. But Extractor 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't see that file either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Strange. I looked at the type and creator code of some MPEG files that 
</I>&gt;<i> Extractor likes on my machine, and they're MPEG and TVOD. I think 
</I>&gt;<i> Extractor expects MPEG-2 and your file might be MPEG-1 - that's one 
</I>&gt;<i> guess.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a Judeth Stern and Robert Lettieri Visual QuickStart Guide to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> QT Pro 5 book that says that I am supposed to be able to see audio 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> export options that don't show up in QTP 6.1. Did Apple remove the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> audio extraction options in 6.1 Pro?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think so. They're just absent for MPEG.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do I get the audio out of the MPEG movie and ultimately into an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MP3 file?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another option is BBdemux (I think its on Sourceforge) - I haven't 
</I>&gt;<i> found it as reliable as Extractor, but its an option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other programs like MediaPipe, FFmpegX, etc. should be able to extract 
</I>&gt;<i> audio, but they're in the &quot;dicey&quot; category that Jim mentioned. It 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to take boundless twiddling to get them to work. Audio is the 
</I>&gt;<i> hitch when working with MPEG. I don't know enough about MPEG to know 
</I>&gt;<i> the technical reasons behind it, but it seems like there aren't any 
</I>&gt;<i> programs for dealing with MPEG as an integrated stream like other AV 
</I>&gt;<i> formats. It seems standard procedure to &quot;demux&quot; them (i.e. split the 
</I>&gt;<i> audio and video) and deal with them as separate entities. There are 
</I>&gt;<i> more freeware programs for the PC - maybe the Mac will catch up.
