<PRE>Hi Kunga

Cheers for the feedback. I should have added that was my first action 
(iMovie Feedback page) My reason for submitting it to the list was to 
highlight it to others and perhaps then let others with the same 
problem see that they are not alone. You never know, someone might well 
have found their own way of working with the problem and have 
suggestions of how to get around it.

I  have to say that my experience of the Apple Support service is less 
than satisfactory. Even if there was something as simple as an 
automated reply acknowledging that my feedback was received with a 
reference number to follow up with would be something.

I should also say that I am a FCP user and that is one reason why it 
has taken me this long to notice the problems with iMovie 3. But I do 
still use iMovie 3 from time to time for simplified video work and 
first cut editing.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are 2 problems with iMovie3 I have noticed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Problem 1:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have come across a problem when importing additional clips (camera 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> source: Canon XL1) This happens if you have imported clips then 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> editied those clips and then wish to import additional clips after 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first set have been editied.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What seems to happen is this. I have imported clips with a limited 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amount of storage space on my computer. I fill the space that is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available (not to the very end) then edit the imported clips. When I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> empty the trash of the unsed clips I import more of the clips to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> edited. As the new clips are imported they are given a clip number. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the new clip numbers begin at 1 then 2, then 3 and so on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Later when I have edited all the clips (first set then second set) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and play back the edited film the following starts to happen...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When the playhead reaches a point where the clip being played repeats 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same clip number as an earlier one. The visual returns to the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first clip with that number, but the audio continues as the second 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clip with that number. (sorry if this is confusing)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I am trying to say is that any time you import new clips and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are no clips in the 'clips pane' the new clips start loading 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> again as 'clip 1' 'clip 2' 'clip 3' and so on. The playback seems to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get confussed reading the second set of clip numbers as the first.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What would solve the problem would be if any additional clip imports 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continued being numbered from the last clip import. ie: if the first 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set of clip imports were numbered 1 to 6 and the next set continued 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with 7 and so on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Problem 2:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have also noticed that when you wish to drop in a clip over an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> audio extract, a short burst of audio from the dropped-in clip bleeds 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into the audio, it sounds something like a scratch on the audio &gt;&gt; track.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have tried to oversize the clip, then extract the audio, then trim 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> off the start to avoid this, but no luck. Nothing I have been able to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do gets me over this problem. Any solutions would be welcomed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My Equipment:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iMac SuperDrive 800mhz, 512Mb Ram
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Canon XL1 camera
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you,
