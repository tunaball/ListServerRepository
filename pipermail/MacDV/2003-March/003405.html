<PRE>Actually, in real world performance, the 5400 RPM drives aren't that 
much faster than the 4200 RPM drives (according to benchmarks done and 
reported on various web sites).

The problem with using FireWire drives for DV capture is not that the 
drives themselves or the FireWire interface aren't fast enough, it's 
that there's contention with the FireWire bus when transferring to/from 
a FireWire camera on the same bus -- both devices *want* control, but 
only one of them *gets* it.  If you had a PowerBook, you could probably 
get a FireWire PC card, connect the drive to that and connect the 
camera to the built-in FireWire port and be good to go.  This is just a 
theory, though, and I don't know if this has actually been tried as a 
work-around for this problem. (but doesn't it make sense that it would 
work?)

Anyway, if you are doing video you definitely need a drive bigger than 
20 GB.  So shop around, check out reviews and benchmarks and get the 
biggest, fastest drive that will fit internally in your iBook.  And 
while your at it, you should partition the new drive with a partition 
completely dedicated to video -- System software and applications 
really clutter up and fragment drives in a hurry (*ESPECIALLY* Mac OS X 
-- it's a mess).  So let's say you get a 60 GB hard drive, you'd set up 
a 10 or 20 GB partition for your system and applications, and a second 
40 or 50 GB partition to use JUST for video.

Other World computing usually has decent prices, and they have 
benchmarks for most of the drives they sell.  <A HREF="http://www.macsales.com/">http://www.macsales.com/</A>

2 cents.
