Let me say I have already performed my own biased tests.
I use Norton speed disk.
Takes 5 seconds to defrag and OTIMIZE the video storage disk because it 
is empty.
  It gets done w/ the Media setting.
When I do my boot disk it take somewhat longer (haha) .
One time Idid it for media and git an over all Xbench score of like 108
When I redid it with the OSX/9 setting my scores shot up to 114-119.
This is just for regular stuff no video.


Now you are saying alot about the OS but that conflicts with your 
earlier opinion that the disc controller is &quot;in control&quot;. I accept this 
notion.
I would have to believe (and do) that the disc controller and Speed 
disc are in fact in collusion to provide me with control I can 
understand.
  I believe when Speed disk shows the main OS on one end of the virtual 
disk space and the updates on the other and little holes where small 
pieces of OS used to be but are now deleted that this is a factual if 
not accurate representation .(the same goes for Apps and other files) I 
believe that when I defrag and Optimize, those holes are in fact 
filled, reducing the number of possible bad or wrong choices that the 
disc controller might make in the future. I also believe that when it 
shows me and tells me the numbers  of fragmented files and shows the 
contiguous space available that, that too, may not be actual but the 
fact that the space is being reported to speed disc as contiguous means 
that the disc controller is treating it as such.
I know even though one could run for years without doing it, my 
business dictates that in addition to constant updates and downloads 
and my personal fun, that it is prudent to do this procedure on my boot 
disc in order to have the greatest flexibility and capacity I can.
  I have consulted with some learned people on this subject. They agree.
I am sorry but  with your brand new computer &lt; OS and tiny little 
files, You probably are never going to reproduce our experiences 
without seriously abusing your machine first.
Anyway Have fun!
Jim
