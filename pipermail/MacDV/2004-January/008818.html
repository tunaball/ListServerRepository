<PRE>It is hard to know where to start, you have so many ingenious but 
completely wrong ideas.

Except... Apple would be competing against itself, with twice the 
overhead, and both sets of products competing for the limited amount of 
developer attention.  When was the last time Ford made GM cars?

</I>
How would a version of MacOS running on a PC made by Apple address this?
The ABI for MacOS is completely different to and incompatible with the 
Windows API that games are written to.

&gt;<i> If Apple made x86 machines and the OS they could make everything work

</I>
If that were true, Apple could wave its magic copper wand and make it 
all &quot;just work&quot; on the PPC, too. It's not true.

&gt;<i> I am against them simply porting X to x86 flat out though and Apple

</I>
On the contrary, Apple has this working in the labs now, and keeps it 
working, presumably as a Hail Mary contingency plan (same reason that 
Solaris was ported to x86 back in 1993/4).
