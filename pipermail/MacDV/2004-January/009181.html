OK, I get it now. I asked for it. Musta been the short skirt and
provocative look. OK, FYI, the disc failed to play on 4 machines, 3
different brands, two of the machines less than 6 months old. Major brands
all: Sharp, RCA, and two models of Sanyo. Not an Apex or a Flookenheimer in
the lot. But I guess it must be the brand of DVD I'm using, KHypermedia...
which burned just fine with iDVD 2 and, I believe, 10.2.3 (??). Sorry, pal.
You need to get more info before you launch into unhelpful metaphors of
blame. But I would welcome any help in diagnosing the problem beyond my
current less than resourceful state. Oh, just for the record, I make my
living running an audio production studio, so I'm not that technologically
challenged, though I'm the first to admit I do have a lot to learn about
video... and marketing promises. OK, I mentioned I was pretty sore. Being
patronized really doesn't help.

</I>
Or that my e-mail reader is stupid because it doesn't filter out messages
that miss the point. As I said, any constructive suggestions would be
helpful. I expect my Sonicare to clean my teeth. It does. My coffee maker
makes coffee. Yay. And nobody ever claimed in a keynote address that my Mac
would natively run PC programs. If that were what I wanted, I'd bloody buy
a PC, and expect it to perform as advertised. But the purpose of iDVD is
simply expressed, the claims are plain and expansive. It doesn't do the one
thing it's supposed to do. Now THAT's stupid.

</I>&gt;<i>you can take the time to figure it out. Its really not that hard.
</I>
I'm all ears if you have any pertinent, helpful suggestions. Sorry if I put
you on the defensive. I've been an Apple booster for a long time - as I
mentioned, exclusively Mac since 1968, Apple //e before. Not until the
advent of the current slate of OS (the X viles) have I experienced Apple as
a company all too willing to allow its users to be unwitting beta testers.
I don't spend $3000 on a computer to be frustrated. There are other brands
I could use if that's what I want. It may be OK with you. It's not OK with
me.

OK, enough bellyachin' from me. There's obviously a reason why this is
happening consistently. I'll see if  I can open the project file in iDVD3
and will report back. I think iDVD2 is gone forever.

Bobbo what about those camcorders with Hard drives that encode as you=20
film.Samsung ITCAM.port an hours footage in five minutes.!  .More expense..

Thanks, Mandy. Importing footage isn't the problem. It's encoding a DVD
that will play on any of the 4 test machines.
