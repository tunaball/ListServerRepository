Well, a search of archives of Accelerate Your Mac might provide some 
clues.
	<A HREF="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/">http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/</A>

  As far as I'm concerned, I've always been leery of Norton products.  
Especially in OS 9, when extensions installed by Norton's would do way 
more harm than good :-)  Anyone who feels an overnight run of any disk 
utility is an acceptable use of CPU cycles, fine by me.  The size of 
the HD in question and the  bandwidth of the bus have made these sorts 
of exercises take an inordinate amount of time and energy.  If Panther 
helps keep things in check so you can wait longer before having to run 
any utility, then that makes yet another point in favor of an OS 
upgrade :-)

This from a guy who still runs 9.1 on a G3 upgraded 6100 - connected to 
the Airport base station w/ ethernet, and is still using a POTS 
internet access!  A review of the bills this month leads me to think 
that a DSL connection may soon be a break-even proposition given we 
drop the second land line.  Speed, or perceived speed, or the lack 
thereof, is directly related to how much you value your time.

WRT to the other dead horse currently under discussion, I can't see how 
having unused disk space on a HD because the controller can't see the 
other 21GB can possibly help the disk performance when the HD gets 
stuffed.  In this instance I would probably be happy to dedicate it to 
projects and then a quick reformat if and when necessary.  The whole 
reason to use Macs in the first place is that the get out of your way 
and let you work on projects.  Having to run utilities may be a 
necessary evil, but then having the system freeze and lose data used to 
be a regular part of the Mac experience under anything before OS X.  
People seem to have forgotten how sweet things are for us Mac users now
