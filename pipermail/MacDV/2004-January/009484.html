<PRE>So how do you install 2.1.2 if 3.0.3 is already living there? I remember a much better
overall experience there, too.

</I>&gt;<i> I crossed my fingers when I bought it. I have used it successfully
</I>&gt;<i> with iMovie, Final Cut Pro 3.01 and FCExpress 1.0.1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Couple of things. Are you capturing directly to the same drive that
</I>&gt;<i> your system &amp; application is on. In an ideal world you would like a
</I>&gt;<i> separate drive to capture your project to and in a better world, a
</I>&gt;<i> separate drive to render to. Saves wear and tear on HD heads and is
</I>&gt;<i> much quicker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt that is your problem in your sound capturing glitches, just
</I>&gt;<i> something to bear in mind. Your computer is certainly fast enough. As
</I>&gt;<i> a no comparison, my system is using a 768 MB RAM PB Ti 667 DVI
</I>&gt;<i> running 3 external hard drives, (2-120 Gb &amp; 30 Gb) the JVC deck and
</I>&gt;<i> an external FW DVD burner so you have much more CPU juice than me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you tried using iMovie 2.1.2? Personally, iMovie 3 ( and the
</I>&gt;<i> upgrades) have burned me so badly a number of times that I nowrefuse
</I>&gt;<i> to use it. Not in any capture issues necessarily with the deck but in
</I>&gt;<i> many and various glitches that it continues to exhibit in editing. As
</I>&gt;<i> a result, I have backgraded to iMovie 2.1.2 and recommend it heartily
</I>&gt;<i> to all. I am not alone either after a good friend who is using a
</I>&gt;<i> faster 1 GHz G4 flat panel iMac got so frustrated with iMovie 3 after
</I>&gt;<i> continually losing work that I backgraded him, too. He now smiles
</I>&gt;<i> while he edits. Too bad as iMovie 3 has such a nice interface. I
</I>&gt;<i> digress...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest the 12-bit sound issue is not the problem either.
</I>&gt;<i> That will show up only with sync issues and can be fixed in
</I>&gt;<i> Quicktime. Unless you are running two mikes or a wireless mike with
</I>&gt;<i> something like a Canon XL1 then you should almost always use 16-bit
</I>&gt;<i> sound. Does your TRV900 allow you to choose between 12 and 16 bit?
</I>&gt;<i> Probably, as they are great camera's. If so, make sure you are
</I>&gt;<i> capturing at 16-bit. Change your deck to 16-bit (48kHz) also. Have
</I>&gt;<i> you checked to make sure that your original footage is without sound
</I>&gt;<i> issues? You know the cliche, garbage in... garbage out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More JVC deck flotsam... sometimes, the system doesn't recognize the
</I>&gt;<i> deck as a firewire device. ?? Simple solution. Unplug the firewire
</I>&gt;<i> connection to the deck from the computer wait a few seconds and plug
</I>&gt;<i> back in. The procedure reboots the FW bus and bingo your deck should
</I>&gt;<i> be recognized. I have had better success unplugging from the back of
</I>&gt;<i> the computer than on the small FW plug on the JVC deck. As you know,
</I>&gt;<i> the front connection is the standard and more fragile 4-pin type
</I>&gt;<i> camera connection so better to manipulate the larger 6-pin on the
</I>&gt;<i> computer as a general rule. However, after that warning I don't
</I>&gt;<i> follow my own advice 'cause when copying from the miniDV to VHS or
</I>&gt;<i> the reverse and I want to use my computer I unplug the front FW plug
</I>&gt;<i> as it is more convenient for me. In doing that, be careful and make
</I>&gt;<i> sure you correctly have the 4-pin aligned properly on re-plug as I
</I>&gt;<i> have heard of ham-fisted types jamming it in the wrong way. I have
</I>&gt;<i> also found it is better to have your deck on before launching editing
</I>&gt;<i> software and quitting such before shutting the deck off. Obviously,
</I>&gt;<i> this doesn't apply when capturing a finished project back to miniDV.
</I>&gt;<i> Then... just make sure the computer won't go to sleep and let the
</I>&gt;<i> capture to the deck proceed - uninterrupted and unabated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other cool things that this JVC deck can do, and not documented with
</I>&gt;<i> my version DVS1U, is the ability to capture directly off an external
</I>&gt;<i> and older analog 8mm camera or H8 or digital 8 models through the
</I>&gt;<i> external RCA/SVideo plugs on the front of the deck. I have captured
</I>&gt;<i> footage directly, on-the-fly, from an external devices directly onto
</I>&gt;<i> a separate FW drive without first capturing to either VHS or miniDV.
</I>&gt;<i> That feature alone has saved me countless hours. Didn't mean to blab
</I>&gt;<i> on but as you can guess I do like the deck and its features.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To summarize:
</I>&gt;<i> Get your deck set-up properly. Double check deck menu settings. Read
</I>&gt;<i> the manual. Check original footage. I wouldn't be the least bit
</I>&gt;<i> surprised that your issues are iMovie 3 related. IMHO... iMovie 3.0.3
</I>&gt;<i> sucks. After doing all that, then have the deck either checked or
</I>&gt;<i> replaced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My 2 cents.
</I>&gt;<i> (I guess this one is 10 cents...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rod
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I actually went back and read the manual, which says something about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;dubbing at 12-bit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;rather than 16-bit sound.  Does that ring a bell?  I can't change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the setting because I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;don't have a tv hooked up yet so the remote doesn't work.   I wonder
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;if those two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;changes -- 16-bit to 12-bit and hooking up the tv may make a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;difference.  We'll see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;......

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  &gt; I just bought a JVC HR_DVS3U dual tape recorder, thinking that it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  &gt; save wear on my TRV-900 and be really convenient at copying from mini DV
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  &gt; tapes to VHS tapes and act as an interface to a TV monitor.  It has a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  &gt; firewire control socket which works well from iMovie 3 on my dual G4
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  &gt; mac, so far as obeying instructions, but the sound has skips in it, both
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  &gt; as it plays directly in iMovie and as it records into iMovie.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  &gt; yet to try recording onto a VHS tape, but I wonder if anybody has ideas
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  &gt; whether this skipping is fixible.  The TRV900 works just fine on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  &gt; same tape, so I guess it's not the cable.
