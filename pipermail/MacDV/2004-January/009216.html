<PRE>Dear DV enthusiasts,

&gt;<i> It makes a DVD-R, which is what its supposed to do.  It may be news to
</I>&gt;<i> you that there's a difference between brands of DVD-Rs and that players
</I>&gt;<i> don't read factory pressed disks and DVD-Rs equally well. But that's
</I>&gt;<i> the state of the art.
</I>
Wow. Looks like my instincts were correct. I just purchased an I-bookG4 
and decided to wait a little while before getting involved with burning 
DVs (and spending the extra money on the superdrive).

I've been doing Macs since '83, but as a &quot;user&quot;, not a engineer type. I 
did fudge a bit of software to get my original mac to talk to a modem, 
but that was fun.

I love my mac because it has always been intuitive, in contrast to the 
PCs I've used, especially before Windows.

DVs burned on a Mac should play in any player if the Mac is going to be 
useful. If it doesn't like the media that's loaded, it should tell you 
so with a pop up prompt. When I rent a DVD, it plays anywhere. Why 
should a burned DV be any different? At least, that's what us &quot;Users&quot; 
will think. We are not looking for puzzles to solve.

I bought my first I-Mac (limited edition DV version) to do movies, and 
then found out the I-Movie 1 wouldn't import any of the media I had. 
Was a serious disappointment.

Now, I see that the new &quot;burners&quot; of DV will be a problem for a while 
till the technology catches up for the consumer. I'll wait, thank you.

later, barry

</PRE>
