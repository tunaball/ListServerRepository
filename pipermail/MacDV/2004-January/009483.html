<PRE>I've been using a JVC HR_DVS1U (original model) since it was 
introduced 3 years? ago. It wasn't officially supported by Apple and 
I crossed my fingers when I bought it. I have used it successfully 
with iMovie, Final Cut Pro 3.01 and FCExpress 1.0.1.

Couple of things. Are you capturing directly to the same drive that 
your system &amp; application is on. In an ideal world you would like a 
separate drive to capture your project to and in a better world, a 
separate drive to render to. Saves wear and tear on HD heads and is 
much quicker.

I doubt that is your problem in your sound capturing glitches, just 
something to bear in mind. Your computer is certainly fast enough. As 
a no comparison, my system is using a 768 MB RAM PB Ti 667 DVI 
running 3 external hard drives, (2-120 Gb &amp; 30 Gb) the JVC deck and 
an external FW DVD burner so you have much more CPU juice than me.

Have you tried using iMovie 2.1.2? Personally, iMovie 3 ( and the 
upgrades) have burned me so badly a number of times that I nowrefuse 
to use it. Not in any capture issues necessarily with the deck but in 
many and various glitches that it continues to exhibit in editing. As 
a result, I have backgraded to iMovie 2.1.2 and recommend it heartily 
to all. I am not alone either after a good friend who is using a 
faster 1 GHz G4 flat panel iMac got so frustrated with iMovie 3 after 
continually losing work that I backgraded him, too. He now smiles 
while he edits. Too bad as iMovie 3 has such a nice interface. I 
digress...

I would suggest the 12-bit sound issue is not the problem either. 
That will show up only with sync issues and can be fixed in 
Quicktime. Unless you are running two mikes or a wireless mike with 
something like a Canon XL1 then you should almost always use 16-bit 
sound. Does your TRV900 allow you to choose between 12 and 16 bit? 
Probably, as they are great camera's. If so, make sure you are 
capturing at 16-bit. Change your deck to 16-bit (48kHz) also. Have 
you checked to make sure that your original footage is without sound 
issues? You know the cliche, garbage in... garbage out.

More JVC deck flotsam... sometimes, the system doesn't recognize the 
deck as a firewire device. ?? Simple solution. Unplug the firewire 
connection to the deck from the computer wait a few seconds and plug 
back in. The procedure reboots the FW bus and bingo your deck should 
be recognized. I have had better success unplugging from the back of 
the computer than on the small FW plug on the JVC deck. As you know, 
the front connection is the standard and more fragile 4-pin type 
camera connection so better to manipulate the larger 6-pin on the 
computer as a general rule. However, after that warning I don't 
follow my own advice 'cause when copying from the miniDV to VHS or 
the reverse and I want to use my computer I unplug the front FW plug 
as it is more convenient for me. In doing that, be careful and make 
sure you correctly have the 4-pin aligned properly on re-plug as I 
have heard of ham-fisted types jamming it in the wrong way. I have 
also found it is better to have your deck on before launching editing 
software and quitting such before shutting the deck off. Obviously, 
this doesn't apply when capturing a finished project back to miniDV. 
Then... just make sure the computer won't go to sleep and let the 
capture to the deck proceed - uninterrupted and unabated.

Other cool things that this JVC deck can do, and not documented with 
my version DVS1U, is the ability to capture directly off an external 
and older analog 8mm camera or H8 or digital 8 models through the 
external RCA/SVideo plugs on the front of the deck. I have captured 
footage directly, on-the-fly, from an external devices directly onto 
a separate FW drive without first capturing to either VHS or miniDV. 
That feature alone has saved me countless hours. Didn't mean to blab 
on but as you can guess I do like the deck and its features.

To summarize:
Get your deck set-up properly. Double check deck menu settings. Read 
the manual. Check original footage. I wouldn't be the least bit 
surprised that your issues are iMovie 3 related. IMHO... iMovie 3.0.3 
sucks. After doing all that, then have the deck either checked or 
replaced.

My 2 cents.
(I guess this one is 10 cents...)

&gt;<i>I actually went back and read the manual, which says something about
