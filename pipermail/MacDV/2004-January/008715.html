Fragging slows drives in 9.  Period.  Don't lecture about method.  You're a
Sophist.  The real argument here is &quot;I don't like that claim, so I will ask
these guys who kindly share their experience to take time out of their
working day--which they won't--to bicker facts with me.  Since they don't
have time to waste time like I do, I win.&quot;  Not logical at all.  You know
bupkiss.
