I shoot my pics with a TRV900 video camera set to superfine still mode 
and progressive scan.( because that's what I have). I store them to a 
memory stick and import (USB card reader)  from there into iPhoto. 
There I crop or turn any that need to be cropped or turned.
Then I open iMovie and dump them all in at once.
I add effects. Render to full quality DV and import into FCP to put the 
music on properly.
Sometimes I import the jpegs from the iPhoto folder straight into FCP 
and do all  the work there, including the motion stuff.
I have found that importing a larger file size type picture like the 
2000x3000 shots you were
talking about look great and do give you more lattitude with the ken 
burns or FCP motion controls. I also agree and appreciate the tip about 
the 1 pixel blur to reduce the flicker while it moves.
There is no reason to use Photoshop unless your pictures are screwed up 
or you want to make artistic compositions  consisting of more than just 
the picture. (Some real color enhancement or something )
If you want to use a third party motion control program that is your 
right,and certainly in the iMovie context you will get more choices.
The QuickTime move is completely unneeded and &quot;high quality&quot; option 
only refers to playback on your computer monitor not the content of the 
file.
The first ttime I used iMiove I thought that was the real picture and 
applied a sharpen to everything. What a mistake. Keep it simple and 
then see good results on a TV.
  My Montage clients really like this stuff.

Meanwhile your canon camera should produce great pictures for these 
purposes.
Or the VX2000.
