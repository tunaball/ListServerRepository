</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I won't post any more about this, I promise!!
</I>
Uh... you keep posting until you feel confident in going forward... I 
think we're all here to help each other out.

&gt;<i> However, if anyone can tell me the steps you go through to produce 
</I>&gt;<i> YOUR beautiful photo to DV files, I would be more than appreciative. 
</I>&gt;<i> We'll meet somewhere and I'll buy you all the tipple and haggis you 
</I>&gt;<i> want!!
</I>
I use my 4 MP digital camera, re-shoot printed photos (on a home-made 
copystand), load those into Still Life, render to DV, then output to 
tape or DVD.  I just let the (sometimes annoying) &quot;noise&quot; things happen 
-- there's really nothing you can do if you want to pan and zoom 
through your stills.  If you do the 1 pixel blur thing, you really need 
to do it to the resulting video (produced by Still Life in this 
example), which would take a LONG time to render (well, maybe not *too* 
long on a dual 2 GHZ G5)...  If you blurred the original hi-res photo, 
it might help *a little* on the final output, but probably not a lot, 
since they're going to get scaled down and &quot;squished&quot; into a tiny 
720x480 rectangle anyway...

&gt;<i> Contrary to some comments, others have recommended scanning images at 
</I>&gt;<i> a high resolution (Jim Heid for example in the Jan. Macworld, p. 77) 
</I>&gt;<i> to get a good pan and zoom effect. Several employees at the Atlanta 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple Store recommended the same (what do those guys know?:-)
</I>
Actually, that's correct -- if you zoomed into a 640x480 image (4:3 
aspect ratio for iMovie, for example), the image would start to break 
up and look pixelated very quickly -- if you zoomed into a 1280x960 
image, you could blow it up 200% and still have a crystal clear image 
with no pixelation.

&gt;<i> My scanned images seem to do better than my images from my high 
</I>&gt;<i> resolution camera. My camera produces images at 3072x2048 at 180 dpi 
</I>&gt;<i> (3:2 ratio). With Photoshop, I change the resolution to 72 dpi 
</I>&gt;<i> resulting in an image size 1229x819. It seems to me what matters is 
</I>&gt;<i> the pixel count. If I make the image any smaller, I will not be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to do the kind of zooms I would like w/o pixelation.
</I>
DPI doesn't matter -- it's the actual pixel resolution of your image 
that matters.  The more pixels, the more you can zoom in without 
pixelation.

&gt;<i> Do I need to convert or crop the picture so that it is 4:3 aspect 
</I>&gt;<i> ratio? Hey, I'm grasping for anything to make this work.
</I>
Still Life will work with an image in any aspect ratio -- but the 
output is always in the proper video aspect ratio.

&gt;<i> Even when my images are 72 dpi, I still get the shimmering effect. For 
</I>&gt;<i> example, I took several photos of Christmas decorations (lights, 
</I>&gt;<i> trees, etc...). The lights look like the are just a flashing (they're 
</I>&gt;<i> not) when I do a simple pan. However, other objects do the 
</I>&gt;<i> same-particularly ANY type of line-brick on the side of a house, the 
</I>&gt;<i> edge of someone's clothing, etc....
</I>
The higher contrast the image, and the smaller the detail, the more 
prominent this effect will be.

&gt;<i> I may just have to be satisfied with what I've got although I've seen 
</I>&gt;<i> many examples with good results.
</I>
Where have you seen these examples?  Do you know what hardware/software 
was used?

&gt;<i> I am self-admittedly a &quot;perfectionist.&quot; I am using a 20&quot; Cinema 
</I>&gt;<i> Display w/an ATI 64 MB video card that handles quartz extreme and 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenGL just fine. (Dual 2.0 Ghz G5). Is my Cinema Display to high of a 
</I>&gt;<i> resolution to display the video properly? I dunno...
</I>
So... wait a second... do you see this &quot;shimmering&quot; problem on your 
computer monitor or on your TV/video monitor?

- Mark
