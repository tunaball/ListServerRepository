OK, here's the whole story. Be patient all, as some of I have reported 
before.

Anyway, I edited wedding video in FCP3 on my 12&quot; PowerBook 867 
w/SuperDrive. I exported the main sequence and a highlight version as 
stand alone FC movies. I then opened iDVD. At first it wouldn't let me 
choose the 90 minute option (nor the 60 for that matter). Then, when I 
tried a different time, it let me choose it. Go figure.

Anyway, I arrange things the way I wanted and tried to burn it to a 
cheapie brand DVD-R disk. I got error messages on a few attempts. One 
was &quot;The recording device reported the media error: Power calibration 
area error&quot; and the other (don't remember the exact words) was 
Peripheral Device Write Error (or something to that affect).  Now, in 
the past I had no trouble with these disks, nor with a brand named 
Radius (which also failed).

Well, I decided to see what would happen with Apple branded discs. I 
bought a pack, and sure enough, it burned fine. No problems. When iDVD 
asked if I wanted to burn another copy, I stuck in the cheapie again 
and got the same error as before.

Then, that's when I decided to see if skipping iDVD and copying via 
Toast would do the trick. But, sure enough, I got this error message:
&quot;Illegal Request
Sense Code=0x30, 0x.05
Cannot Write Medium- Incompatible Format.&quot;

So, what I don't get is why I had no trouble in the past with these 
discs, and now can't seem to get them to work. I don't mind using the 
Apple discs, but I would like to use discs with Ink Jet printable 
surfaces. I don't feel write handing someone a DVD of their wedding 
with the title handwritten with a Sharpie.

Does anyone have a clue why these discs aren't working? Does the 60+ 
length have anything to do with it?

Daniel
