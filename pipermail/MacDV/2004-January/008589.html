SB, I think I did this but can you describe? thanks!

Thanks to so many of you for the comments. Particularly to Mark Florida 
for recommending the Still Life Software. It looks very promising. 
However, I am still having problems. They may not can be solved. Some 
of your responses said I was going through too many steps or my 
resolution is too high. I realize all that. I only tried the extra 
steps because I wasn't satisified w/the results of the simple steps. 
Although several comments said I was going through too many steps, 
no-one said exactly what steps to go through. I think I've tried them 
all.

I won't post any more about this, I promise!! However, if anyone can 
tell me the steps you go through to produce YOUR beautiful photo to DV 
files, I would be more than appreciative. We'll meet somewhere and I'll 
buy you all the tipple and haggis you want!!

Contrary to some comments, others have recommended scanning images at a 
high resolution (Jim Heid for example in the Jan. Macworld, p. 77) to 
get a good pan and zoom effect. Several employees at the Atlanta Apple 
Store recommended the same (what do those guys know?:-)

My scanned images seem to do better than my images from my high 
resolution camera. My camera produces images at 3072x2048 at 180 dpi 
(3:2 ratio). With Photoshop, I change the resolution to 72 dpi 
resulting in an image size 1229x819. It seems to me what matters is the 
pixel count. If I make the image any smaller, I will not be able to do 
the kind of zooms I would like w/o pixelation. Do I need to convert or 
crop the picture so that it is 4:3 aspect ration? Hey, I'm grasping for 
anything to make this work.

Even when my images are 72 dpi, I still get the shimmering effect. For 
example, I took several photos of Christmas decorations (lights, trees, 
etc...). The lights look like the are just a flashing (they're not) 
when I do a simple pan. However, other objects do the same-particularly 
ANY type of line-brick on the side of a house, the edge of someone's 
clothing, etc....I may just have to be satisfied with what I've got 
although I've seen many examples with good results. I am 
self-admittedly a &quot;perfectionist.&quot; I am using a 20&quot; Cinema Display w/an 
ATI 64 MB video card that handles quartz extreme and OpenGL just fine. 
(Dual 2.0 Ghz G5). Is my Cinema Display to high of a resolution to 
display the video properly? I dunno...

Thanks and Cheers...

Chuck kay
