<PRE>Interesting.  In contrast to these comments, I have had just the 
opposite experience.  The DVDs that I burn on my mac, using either iDVD 
or DVD Studio Pro, work perfectly everywhere.  I have yet to find a DVD 
player in which they will not play, older players included.  I don't 
understand what the concern is.

That said, the next generation of burners are beginning to appear.  
These will burn both sides and increase the capacity to almost 9 GB, 
with commercial software of course.  From what I've read, the 
dual-sided DVDs will require the DVD+R format to work, but I'm not sure 
of that.  I haven't looked into this because I haven't needed it yet, 
but I expect Apple to support these drives too.  I know that the 
Superdrive in the G5 in my office has the ability to burn DVD+R format, 
but the software from Apple does not allow that yet.  Anyone have more 
insight on this?  Specifically, what value is DVD+R over the DVD-R 
format for single-sided DVDs.

</I>&gt;<i> DVs burned on a Mac should play in any player if the Mac is going to

</I>&gt;<i> you so with a pop up prompt. When I rent a DVD, it plays anywhere. Why 
</I>&gt;<i> should a burned DV be any different? At least, that's what us &quot;Users&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> will think. We are not looking for puzzles to solve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I bought my first I-Mac (limited edition DV version) to do movies, and 
</I>&gt;<i> then found out the I-Movie 1 wouldn't import any of the media I had. 
</I>&gt;<i> Was a serious disappointment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I see that the new &quot;burners&quot; of DV will be a problem for a while 
</I>&gt;<i> till the technology catches up for the consumer. I'll wait, thank you.
