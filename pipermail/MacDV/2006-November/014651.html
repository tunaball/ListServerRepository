<PRE>Hello everyone,

I'm new to the list, heck, I'm new to digital video as well so you'll  
have to pardon my naivety. My manager has purchased a 37 inch LTC TV  
that he wants to mount in our front lobby so that we can play a  
looped video promoting our various services and specials. He would  
like to see a combination of video and still images with text  
flashing in and out of the picture,  you know, all that fun stuff.  
The task of creating said video has fallen on me. Now since video  
creating/editing is not really a business we want to get into we  
would prefer not have to spend a fortune on software. Not to worry,  
My Mac has lovely little programs on it called iMovie and iDVD which  
under normal circumstances would be perfect for what I need. Notice  
the mention of &quot;normal circumstances&quot;. Here's the catch, the 37 inch  
TV will be mounted sideways so that it becomes a tall screen (9:16)  
instead of a wide screen (16:9). That's my problem. Filming the video  
sideways isn't a problem, neither is rotating still images in  
Photoshop. I can combine both of them in iMovie and then rotate the  
completed movie in Quicktime to give me a tall video. My problem is  
with text. As far as I can tell iMovie will only allow me to type  
text horizontally (which would normally be what you'd want) but if I  
then turn my video sideways the text would be sideways as well, see  
my problem? What options do I have without having to spend thousands  
of dollars. Would Final Cut Express or Adobe Premier Elements allow  
me to do what I want? Any other suggestions?

Thanks
