<PRE>
I spent some time with it last night just trying to learn the interface.
For those looking for a simple intuitive interface, this is not the
software for you. Even after looking at some of their documentation
online, it is not easy. Some of the effects I was trying to use are
either really NOT intuitive and I did not spend enough time trying to
work it out, or they are disabled in the free version. I am not sure
which is the case.

I was able to use two tracks of video and switch between displaying them
in the composer window but never successfully composited them together.
I was not able to superimpose the two video tracks even though the
effect button was there. Many times it said that the effect was not
valid for those video tracks.

I was also able to resize one of the tracks and use key frames to move
it around the screen. However, once again I could not superimpose or
composite the two tracks of video together.

All-in-all it was a frustrating experience. Perhaps with a book or
manual I could have gotten further but so far my enthusiasm has been
dampened for a product that I had been anticipating since the early
spring when this was first announced.

I think if AVID is hoping that this software will encourage users to
upgrade to AVID DV Express for $1000 they may be disappointed. The
learning curve seems to be a little too steep without some online
tutorials or manuals/instructions. Right now I would feel much more
comfortable moving from iMovie to Final Cut Express or Final Cut Pro.

Even though this is free software and it is not causing any issues on my
Mac, I decided to remove it last night. Without the documentation or
tutorial, I am not willing to spend that much time just trying to learn
it especially since I am not sure if the effects and titling are going
to be advanced enough to produce anything really great. iMovie is
clearly easier, more intuitive and can produce video quickly and easily
so you can see your results and spend more time on improving your
editing technique rather than spending time trying to learn an
interface.

Just my thoughts. If anyone else has been brave enough to try it and can
offer some advice, I may go back to testing again. But for now I am
sticking with iMovie until I make the switch to FCE or FCP.

Subject: [MacDV] Avid FreeDV software

I just found out that Avid FreeDV is now available for download. It took
such a long time to appear that I was beginning to think it was
vaporware. I've downloaded it but I'm not going to be able to run it
because it requires Mac OS 10.2.4 which I don't have yet. (Not that
anyone cares here, there's also a version of it available for download
that runs on Windows XP. Of course, because of Windows bloat, it is
nearly double the file size.) 

It's free software and I can only assume that Avid intends it to be an
iMovie killer and hopes that people who use it will want to move up to
their pricey professional software instead of Final Cut Pro. 

I'd be curious to hear on this list from anyone who might try it out and
see what their impressions of it are. I'd like to see how it would
compare to iMovie as far as both ease of use, features and just how well
it works. I may eventually have a newer version of Mac OS X but for now
I'll just have to hear from you guys.

Here's the link to get to it for anybody interested:
