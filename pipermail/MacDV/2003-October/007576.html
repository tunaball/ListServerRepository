<PRE>I looked at the project file and it does reference all the clips that I
put in the movie. Some how these clips are no longer in the media
folder. What is the best way to get media from one project into another
project without importing from the camera again?

</I>
Make a copy of your iMovie project file. Then open it in
TextEdit. Scan through the file and make sure that all
the media actually appears in your original project Media
folder. I suspect you lost a clip or two along the way.

As a rule, don't mess with your Media folder unless you're
really confident about what you're doing.

As for the reference movie, it will rebuild when you open
and save your iMovie project.
