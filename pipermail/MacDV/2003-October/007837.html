<PRE>The&quot; bush telegraph&quot; has it that a new version of iLife will be 
released in January which will include iTunes 5 and significant 
upgrades for iMovie and iDVD.   If this rumour does come to fruition  I 
then hope it might improve the performance of iMovie 3.0.3 for me.   I 
have two problems namely :-

1. I am experiencing electronic &quot;pops&quot; when joining some clips together 
(no transition used).  It does not happen that often and I can 
sometimes remove it by either cropping the last of the first clip, or 
the start of the second clip.  It happens where there is no audio, or 
where I have reduced the audio to &quot;o&quot;.     Also, when using &quot;Fade In&quot; 
the audio jumps from one level to another, rather than being smooth and 
the picture is fluttery until the transition is completed.

2. As I get more into editing  a movie eg. adding titles, transitions 
and still photos,  the Appn. gets slower and it takes ages for &quot;Save 
Project&quot; ,  &quot;Play&quot;,  or other commands
to respond.  Strangely though,the process of  adding  transitions and 
titles to the time line doesn't slow down during the editing of a movie.

I could return to iMovie 2( as I placed it into a separate folder at 
Kunga's suggestion at the time iMovie 3 came out) , but I prefer to 
work with the latest version because of the Ken Burns effect and the 
ability to use rubber banding when adjusting audio.   I do note that 
although I may produce a movie with iMovie 3 it will at times open up 
in iMovie 2.

I am using OSX 10.2.6 on a G4 933 mhz. with 640 mbs of RAM.   At the 
end of the latest movie I still had 24 gigs to spare on the HD.

My Applications (OSX) window (folder) has three items in it 
appertaining to iMovie viz :-

             iMovie (which is iMovie 3.0.3 Appn. on its own  and appears 
as the blue clapperboard the same as in the Dock)
             iMovie 2 Folder (which contains a Resources Folder, iMovie 
2 Appn and an iMovie guide)
             iMovie Resources Folder (which is identical to the 
Resources Folder immediately above)

Could the rearrangement of these , or the deletion of the iMovie 2  
Folder help?

Any assistance, or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Ian Tucker
