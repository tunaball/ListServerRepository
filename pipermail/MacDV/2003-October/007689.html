It could still be a problem if the drive isn't quite getting up to 
speed, though it it gets this far I really don't know. Remember the 
drive not only has to be kept spinning at its target speed, you also 
need power to move the read/write heads around. The only way to be sure 
is to borrow or buy an external power source and see if that fixes the 
problem.

For the original poster, I don't know if its an option to call the 
company you got the enclosure from and tell them you'll buy the power 
adapter on the condition that if it still doesn't work you can return 
it and the enclosure for a refund -or whatever deal you want or can set 
up with them. Make sure to record all details of the call such as who 
you talked to, when you called, and write down notes on what was 
actually said -just in case.

After further reflection, I also have to say my statement about these 
enclosures being just a case with a couple cables and plugs was a 
little off. There is also a Firewire bridge which shouldn't take too 
much power.
