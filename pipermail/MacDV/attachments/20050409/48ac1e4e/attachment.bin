Norm,

If you have <underline>good </underline>sound it will carry you
through the iffy video. Try and get to the room and check out the
sound. If you have a even a still picture of someone you can have them
talking and most of your viewers will be perfectly happy, but if you
have a great picture and sound where the room reverb gets to your mike
before the lip synch sound, they will be peeved at least.

Consider taking a lot of digital pics, if you can, to help break up
the video.

It works for the big guys, why not you. 

Good luck and let us know how it turns out.

Kind regards,

<excerpt>Hi all,

           I will be doing my first graduation

ceremony. I'm assuming it will be quite dark inside. I

am using a Canon ZR70. Knowing it is not a "Pro"

camera I am looking for tips on using this camera

under these conditions. "Low light". Also, would

zooming in on the subject be better than a stationary

shoot. The entire class will have copies available so

the video needs to be good for all of the students.

Thank you in advance for any and all help.


Regards,

Norm L.
