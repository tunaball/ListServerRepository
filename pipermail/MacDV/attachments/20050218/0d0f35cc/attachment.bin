Thank you for the advice!  I just did what you suggested, and ignored
the Error messages, and Quick-Batch-imported a dozen files at a time. 
Fantastic!  I still have to export them as QuickTime movies one at a
time, but that's much less time-consuming than the importing part.

So thank you!

Now just for interest's sake, because you and others on this list
probably know about the more expensive alternatives that I was on the
point of considering (Cleaner, ProCoder, maybe others).  

Are there hugely valuable things that these apps do, that justify
their $500 price tag?  If I want to edit (using Avid - apologies to
the many FCP users on this site) DV footage mostly, but also these AVI
files from my dig. still camera, and then export the finished product
to DVD, for Window and Mac, and normal DVD players, am I o.k. without
these special apps?  (I have Sorenson Squeeze 4, but haven't used it
yet).  Any (more) advice would be appreciated!

Malcolm

Indeed the app is not completely 10.3 compatible, however just click

though the error dialogs, open the quicktime player and set the export

to what you want, drag and drop the files to QuickBatch (I find that

more that 30 at a time can sometimes be a problem) Select the export

directory and hit export. Just cancel all the error dialogs that come

up. It will work. Promise :-)

<excerpt>Thanks so much for the tip, Alex.  I've downloaded Quick
Batch, and it

looks so good!  But unfortunately for me, it hasn't been updated for

Panther... I tried using it anyway, and I get an error window.  I've

e-mailed the program's author to ask if and when it might be

updated... I'll let you know what he says.

In case he doesn't update, please let me know, any of you, whether

there are any other little apps, like Quick Batch, that might help me

out!

Cheers,
