Hello Thom 


You could hook up the ps2 to a digitizer, if you have one or could
borrow one.  This is the kind of gadget used to import vhs to a
computer.

<excerpt>Hi all,


 My daughter needs to import a short segment from a game on her PS2. 
I can physically connect the PS2 to her iBook with a Firewire cable,
but when I set iMovie to import, I get a message stating that the
camera is not connected.  Is there a way to do what I want to do?



 TiA,


 Thom
