Hello, was there ever an answer to this question (copied below)?  I
have the same dilemma.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 


Thanks, Quincy

<fontfamily><param>Courier</param><x-tad-bigger>This may have already
been covered, but I have just acquired a Dazzle 

and would like to use it on my 12" Albook, 867mhz, 640 meg,
SuperDrive. 

  Anybody heard of Mac drivers?  How can I get my PB to recognize the 

USB Dazzle?  I have Virtual PC, but hate Windows, would like to run it 

on my OS 10.3.3
