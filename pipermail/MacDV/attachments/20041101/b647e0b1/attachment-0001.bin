<fontfamily><param>Times</param>Despite the verbal attacks and put
downs by both sides, for me this election goes beyond Bush and Kerry. 
A famous writer named, Dante said,  "The hottest place in Hell is
reserved for those who in time of crisis remain neutral."   And
according to , Edmund Burke, "For evil to triumph, it is only
necessary for good men to do nothing."  Therefore, this election, I
will vote for the "issue" that matters most -- the right to life for
the unborn -- those who are most vulnerable and are not able to speak
for themselves.   


Many people have told me this election is about "the wrong war" and
about jobs and health care, taxes, etc.  Yes, those issues are
important -- they affect most people and me.  But, I submit that if,
as a country, we continue to support a law that makes it "legal" to
kill over 4,000 babies a day (that's per day) for the sake of
convenience, our country as we know it will suffer collapse from its
own selfish bent.   History shows that when a civilization resorts to
killing its young, it is doomed to defeat and/or extinction.  We have
become a nation that idolizes the pursuit of pleasure and avoiding
pain at all costs -- of blaming the other guy and not taking
responsibility for our own actions -- of turning a blind eye when
called on to stand up to speak out against unjust behavior.  It's time
to begin reversing this trend.  I want my grand children to grow up in
a society that protects their right to think critically and protects
the rights of the less fortunate.


Putting all politics and spin aside, we have two choices in this
election -- to vote for life or to continue to support the legal
destruction of life.  I choose to protect the unborn by voting for
life.  The issues of war, jobs, health care, social security and taxes
don't even matter if you don't have life to experience them.  This is
where I put my stake in the ground when I'm called to account for my
voting decision.  I hope you will find some wisdom in this and vote
your conscience on November 2nd.
