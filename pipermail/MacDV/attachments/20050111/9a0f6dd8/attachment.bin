I have two 20-inch cinema displays connected to a G4 tower (the older
one and the current one). I had to replace a 22-inch Mitsubishi
monitor that suddenly went black. The LCDs are so much brighter and
crisper that it didn't upset me at all to replace that giant monitor
with a small, thin LCD -- the best display I've ever seen. I work
primarily with photos.
