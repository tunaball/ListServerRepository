<fontfamily><param>Times</param>My apologies to the list but I cannot
let this pass. Especially in light of the way the election seems to be
going. 


I not only find this post annoying but offensive as well. You espouse
a society based on critical thinking and compassion, yet you fail to
hold yourself to either. Not to mention the (I assume) religious
affiliations you hold has been the touchstone for the slaughter of
millions and the doctrine by which countless cultures and
civilizations have been eradicated.


The practice of "killing ones young" is certainly not unique to this
country, and has been practiced for ages when too many females were
born to "peasant" families whom could not support another. Because for
most of the world (unlike europe and NA) the government does not
support the poor. Women need dowries and hence become burdens. The
logic being it is better to kill one than for all of them to starve or
suffer.


Perhaps if we did make this election about jobs and health care and
taxes, we would have the time to develop a more compassionate nature
as a culture. If you would poke your head out of your shell for a
moment and look at the marvelous array of culture and belief systems
that exist somewhere outside of your gated community, perhaps you too
would see that abortion is the least of our worries.

Putting all politics and spin aside, we have two choices in this
election -- to vote for life or to continue to support the legal
destruction of life.  I choose to protect the unborn by voting for
life.  The issues of war, jobs, health care, social security and taxes
don't even matter if you don't have life to experience them.  This is
where I put my stake in the ground when I'm called to account for my
voting decision.  I hope you will find some wisdom in this and vote
your conscience on November 2nd.
