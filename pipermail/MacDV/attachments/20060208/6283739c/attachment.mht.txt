Fellow Creators:
I would like to suggest that if you know a dentist, doctor, mechanic, 
instructor, etc. it would be highly unlikely that they would provide their services 
for a &quot;favor&quot;. Why do folks in the arts and creative businesses always get 
lowballed and be expected to &quot;share their gifts and &quot;Hobbies&quot; for little of 
nothing. I am also a musician and it's amazing that what others admire in your 
talents in these areas, seem to compute to so little in dollar value. I say if you 
provide the time, equipment, skill and heart, you should receive a fair value 
for it. End of sermon. thanks.
