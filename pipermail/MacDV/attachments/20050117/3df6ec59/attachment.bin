I believe the Mac Mini uses the same HD as a powerbook. I have used my
12-inch powerbook quite often when making iMovies.


I also have several external hard drives (firewire) that I also use
and those are 7200 with an 8Mb cache.


The best thing to do is to have an external that is ONLY for movie
making. If you save and resave and resave on any HD it gets fragmented
and slows down and that is the enemy of making movies.


good luck

That is a good question. I have often wondered that too. I guess we'll
see.

Hi there


 I have read many times that DV capuring required a 7200 drive to be

 reliable.


 The new Mac Mini have only a 4200 drive.


 How will that affect DV capturing?


 Kind regards

 Michael Kristensen
