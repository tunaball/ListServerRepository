I second that, I use Toast 6 Titanium to send VCDs and SVCDs of my
daughter to my parents. They can be viewed on PCs and regular DVD
players. One note of caution, the SVCD seems to have more
compatibility issues than VCD.

Hi all,

           What would be the best software to use to

burn VCD's and SCVD's? I have a PowerMac G4 w/ dual

1.42 processors, 1 gig of Ram. I am running OSX

10.2.8. I will be making 3-5 minute videos and will

need them to be played on computers, both Mac and

Windows and also on settop DVD players. Any

suggestions would be appreciated.


Thank's

Norm L.
