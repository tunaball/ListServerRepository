Sorry to ask something that is OT.


A French friend of mine has recently installed iTunes 4.8. It appears
that since that time he has problems with iTunes, mainly while
importing but even when listening.

Every now and then a screen appears saying something like: The
sequence has stopped due to a missing file
<fontfamily><param>Tahoma</param><x-tad-smaller>org_0002c905ietemp</x-tad-smaller></fontfamily>.

This file seems to be a hidden file which cannot be retrieved that
easily. A reinstall and deleting the preferences did not work.

He even deleted iTunes and tried to reinstall using the 4.8 installer
from the apple website. The installer starts complaining that there is
already a newer version of iTunes installed than he is about to
install. My friend really claims to install the newest version.

He is now checking the permissions and the hard disk through disk
utility. I'm going to sleep. Hope you friends on the other side of the
ocean can help me and him in solving this problem. Perhaps it sounds
familiar to some of you?


Kind regards and goodnight from the Netherlands,
