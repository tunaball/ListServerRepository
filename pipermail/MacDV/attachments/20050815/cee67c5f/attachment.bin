I just used my video cam as a microphone for an audio chat. I've also
used the headset from that software that lets you speak and it tries
to interpret what you said. (IBM Via Voice, I think) That was for
voice into iMovie.

<smaller>I bought a $20 Radio Shack multi-media headset. It works fine
a (hush) PC, but doesn't work on either of our Macs? Whazzup with that?</smaller>

<smaller>Do any of you use a headset? I want to use it with iChat,
Skype, and to record a few sound bytes for various projects. Hi-fi in
these cases not needed.</smaller>
