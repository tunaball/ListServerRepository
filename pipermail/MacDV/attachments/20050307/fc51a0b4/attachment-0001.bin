Jamie,

Are you having problems with the radial sweep or other transitions? My
work around was to export as full DV then use those files for the VCD.
I guess I could have also exported to tape then reimported. The full
DV process was probably longer but less hassle. It worked but I wish I
knew why problems like this crop up.

I am having audio sync problems again when making a VCD in Toast. The

culprit seems to be the radial transitions. I have checked and double

checked the 16bit audio and I do not have FCP or FCE. Things work fine

when playing in the computer and "sharing" back to the camera. The

problem comes in making the VCD with Toast. Anyone else have a problem

with a particular transition?
