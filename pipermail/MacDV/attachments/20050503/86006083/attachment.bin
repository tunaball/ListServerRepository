</excerpt>Well, Yes I have already mentioned this one.

Very nice.

 As I take a few minutes to investigate this situation further., I am
struck by a couple of things.

Several newsgroup threads on various Mac sites are echoing our
discussion eerily.

It really is like cereal boxes in that one may have to call and push
for some discount somewhere.


Second I found at least two other classes of coupon.

One class may be found by methodically looking for them on the Apple
site.

 Was it Brett who got so many workstations?

They have a coupon for a tech to come to your place and tune up your
Tiger. Cool.

I also found this:


<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param><x-tad-smaller> eCoupons can
be applied during checkout for online orders, or let your sales agent
know you would like to apply an eCoupon for phone orders. Shoppers
with an Apple Store account and subscribers to Apple eNews receive
eCoupons for use with Apple Store purchases.



Ok so I have a lot of saved email.

I searched "Apple"


</x-tad-smaller></fontfamily>Lots of shiny email.

But even with all the new stuff recently, I cannot find ( I am not
looking through EVERY email !)

any of these ecoupons and I can't find a single offer of Tiger for
less than $129

for registered customers who have bought already at least Three
versions of this software, care enough to register it, and sign up for
the corporate propaganda emails.

Sue me, I'd like a deal.

The only good deal for Tiger and iWork also includes iLife '05 .
Already got iLife '05 ( again 3rd purchase not counting the $50 for
iMovie 1)

The FCP 5 deal is pretty steep with the only silver lining being
DVDSP, which should have been included with 4 rather than cinema tools
which is 

really beyond worthless to me.

Besides which even if it makes me look bad FCP HD 4.5 blows and needs
to be replaced anyway.

Rant over.
