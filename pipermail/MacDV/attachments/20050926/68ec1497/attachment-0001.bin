I was wondering if something like this would work when there is
nothing in the drive. That's my take on his problem. If there was a
disk in the drive, he could probably boot from it. 


There is always the possibility that it's an unfortunate coincidence
of a hardware problem that just happened to occur after the upgrade.
Check your manual; there may be a way to force the drive open,
something like the old paper clip trick for floppies.
