My first guess would be that the ones that don't play are different
formats.

 You should look at the material that you are putting into iDVD.

Check the formats . If the stuff that doesn't play is different than
the stuff that does play, then you need at least to rinse it with
QTPro.

Mpeg1 and mpeg2 files for instance may look like they work but will
not.

 with stills you don't want to stray too far from jpg or tiff.
