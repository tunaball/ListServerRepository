Chuck: You haven't by chance installed Final Cut Pro since you were
last able to export from iMovie? This can happen if you have both
iMovie and Final Cut Pro installed. To quote Apple:

<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param> "The solution is to
temporarily move the following files from /Library/QuickTime/ to the
Desktop:

▪ 	 DesktopVideoOut.component

▪ 	 DVCPROHDVideoOutput.component

 Restart the computer and try exporting from iMovie to your camera.

When you need to use Final Cut Pro HD again, drag these files back to
/Library/QuickTime/ and restart the computer."
