<fontfamily><param>Courier</param>This may have already been covered,
but I have just acquired a Dazzle 

and would like to use it on my 12" Albook, 867mhz, 640 meg,
SuperDrive. 

  Anybody heard of Mac drivers?  How can I get my PB to recognize the 

USB Dazzle?  I have Virtual PC, but hate Windows, would like to run it 

on my OS 10.3.3

Writers opinion:

 These USB devices depend on Proprietary software which runs only on
Windows.

If you want to use MAc software such as iMovie of FCE or FCP your
machine expects and demands that video be delivered via firewire (
unless you get a costly card).

There are no drivers for you for this unit for OSX or Mac in general.

A Dazzle unit with a Firewire output could work. ( not preferred tho')

I have a Sony converter. Canopus seems to be popular and there are a
couple of other brands.

If someone gave you this thing, give it back.

If they sold it to you, take it back.

You really want one with a Firewire or iLink connector.

Opinion.
