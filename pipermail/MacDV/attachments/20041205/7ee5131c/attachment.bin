<fontfamily><param>Courier</param>This may have already been covered,
but I have just acquired a Dazzle 

and would like to use it on my 12" Albook, 867mhz, 640 meg,
SuperDrive. 

  Anybody heard of Mac drivers?  How can I get my PB to recognize the 

USB Dazzle?  I have Virtual PC, but hate Windows, would like to run it 

on my OS 10.3.3

Having taken a minute to look it up, I assume you are talking about
the Dazzle Fusion which seems to be the name of the USB device.

That's a page to start with. Maybe you could actually just ask the
manufacturers.

My cursory review tells me that this device is not for Macs.

You should not have gotten it to work with a Mac.

It does not seem to be compatible with either QuickTime or standard DV.

I think you are stuck
