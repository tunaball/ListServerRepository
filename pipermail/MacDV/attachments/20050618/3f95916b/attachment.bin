<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>A problem I'm encountering
with my finished movie.


I have "stripes" showing up during transitions in the rendered movie. 
I have de-interlaced all of my clips.    Also, during export, I've
selected "Custom" and set these parameters in the dialog box:


Frame Size 720x480 (NTSC DV (3:2)

Pixel Aspect Ratio:  NTSC - CCIR 601/DV

Field Dominance:  None  (I previously had this set to lower; the
change to 'none' made little difference)

Editing Timebase:  29.97

Timecode Rate: Same as Editing Timebase

Quicktime Video Settings:  DV/DVCPRO - NTSC

Quality:  100%

Audio 48.000


Am I seeing these artifacts because I am viewing the output on my
computer screen when they are ultimately meant for a DVD and a TV
Screen?  


What can I do to eliminate these stripes?


Any thoughts?
