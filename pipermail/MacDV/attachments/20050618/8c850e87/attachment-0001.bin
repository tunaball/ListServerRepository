I found that I can crop during export using compression.  Now, if I
can only get compression to work!

All of my clips were 640x480. They appear in the viewer to be the
correct dimensions, nestled in black border.


I know this is the "safe" area for NTSC. 


However, I would like to export the project to another file type for
the web without these black borders. 


In Adobe Premiere, during export the edges of the entire project can
be cropped. Is there a similar feature in FCP?


(I'd rather not do the motion/scaling, as this will degrade the
quality.  I'm looking to just crop the borders away, hopefully as an
option during rendering).


Thanks for any input,


Jill
