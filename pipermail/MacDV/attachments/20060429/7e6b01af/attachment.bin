<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param><color><param>2120,2322,2423</param>Need
some help. Downloaded a video and it's in a format I don't know what
to do with. First five files, about 1 gig each, end in .I00 to .I04
and the sixth ends in .MDS, and is only 8k. Any help in how to run or
reformat these files would be much appreciated.</color>
