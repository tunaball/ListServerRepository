I had a problem like that and I <italic>think</italic> it was solved
by going to View - External video - and then selecting - All Frames.
Won't hurt to try anyway.

<excerpt>Hi,


I just replaced my old iMac G5 with the new iMac Intel. When I had
Final Cut Pro on my old computer it was installed by a friend and he
configured it all for me before I started using it. He is away on
holidays for the next three weeks and I installed Final Cut Pro on the
new computer. But I am having some problems and i can not find answers
in the 'Help' files.


The problem is.... I load up my video and stills but when I try to
play it back I keep getting the following message when it comes to
playing back the stills clips (this is the first time I have used
stills). I never had this problem before.... so I don't know how to
fix it.

Warning - Dropped Frames


One or more frames were dropped during playback.


If this occurs frequently, try:

-Turning off "unlimited RT"

-Lowering your compression data rate.

-Closing open sequences.

-Lowering the preference for real-time audio tracks.

-Increasing the speed of your system and/or disk drives and/or network
connection.

My system:

iMac Intel

Processor: 2Ghz Intel Core Duo

Memory: 2 GB DDR2 SDRAM

OSX 10.4.7

Final Cut Pro 5


Does anyone know what I have done wrong and how to correct it?


Many thanks.
