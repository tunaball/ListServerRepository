I have used am Audio-Technica microphone (ATM41HE), a small Eurorack
UB802 mixer with two microphone ins and a headphone output (for
monitoring). plus Peak 4 software, with good results.


The main output from the mixer goes to a minijack that's connected
directly to the line input of my 12" Aluminum Powerbook. I set the
main levels using the sound in under the System Preferences and then
fine-tune from the mixer within the software,


I can then edit the soundtrack in Peak on the computer, playing the
output back through the mixer, and then save as an AIFF or an MP3,
depending on the need.


We carry around the mixer, the mike and cables in an old computer bag
I had used for a Duo mac portable.


I've used iMic and another USB sound-in device, but find it a lot more
direct to use the line-in.
