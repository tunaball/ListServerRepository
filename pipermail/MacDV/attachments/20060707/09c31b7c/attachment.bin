In FCP4.5 you can export the project as a Quicktime file.

2nd, what about creating new clips from the edited ones, and they'll
already be in QT format. I'm assuming this is NTSC standard definition
30 fps drop frame. I dcan't recall the details of the steps, but they
are in the manuals.

Hope this belated help helps.

I select the clips but cannot seem to export just the clips. I know in
FCP 5 it's poss to highlight clips and "Reveal in Finder" but I cannot
find these clips with a search in 4.5. 


How do I go about this?
