<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><smaller> I DO THIS ALL THE TIME.   I
find the output of the tivo AND instant replay (I have both) and it
works without a hitch. I actually hook it directly to my dvd stand
alone recorder.  If you do need to record to the mac, you can use the
pass through digital  converter featured on SOME sony camcorders. I'm
not sure which Sony camcorders have this feature, but my digital 8
sony does, as well as the 3 chip sony and the simple one chip.</smaller></fontfamily>


<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><smaller> good luck, works well for me</smaller></fontfamily>

Thanks Alan, 


Unfortunately it doesn't work. I have a TVR-19. S-video or RCA only
goes out on my model. For the TVR-22's and up the Camcorder accepts
S-video in... oh well. 


thanks for your help. If anyone else has hints about how to get Tivo
files onto my mac, let me know.
