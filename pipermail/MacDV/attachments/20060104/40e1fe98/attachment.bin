Hello Joe


I have the same configuration that you do.  What I always do is open
idvd and drag the icon for the imovie project onto the page that
you've decided on.  See if you still have the same sound problem.

<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><smaller> I have a Dual 2 GHz G5 with
1 Gig of Ram. I put together a video project in iMove HD, added
chapter markers and then attempted to create a DVD project of my
iMovie in iDVD 5.0.1 via iMovie HD's "Create iDVD Project" button.
Upon iDVD opening I tested the movie before spending time customizing
the layout of DVD. The audio was nothing but a bunch of crackling. Can
anyone help me with a fix to this problem.</smaller></fontfamily>
