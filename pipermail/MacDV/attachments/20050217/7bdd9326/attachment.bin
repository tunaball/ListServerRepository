Hi there,


<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param><color><param>3333,3333,3333</param><smaller>I
have hundreds of :30 AVI files (Canon dig. camera) that I want to
import into Avid.  

I know how to do this:  

1. import AVI into QT using QuickTiime Pro

2. then export these files as QuickTime movies

3. then import into Avid.


Step 3 is easy, because
</smaller></color><color><param>3332,3332,3332</param><smaller>I can
select all, and import these files
</smaller></color><color><param>3331,3331,3331</param><smaller>into
Avid </smaller></color><color><param>3332,3332,3332</param><smaller>en
masse.</smaller></color><smaller>

<color><param>3333,3333,3333</param>My problem is that in step 1 and 2
I have to import and export these AVI files into QT one at a time. 
It's incredibly slow and time-consuming.</color>

<color><param>3333,3333,3333</param>On an Avid (Mac) forum, someone
suggested I use a program called ProCoder to batch encode these files,
but it's $500.  ProCoder Express is within my price range $50, but I
asked at Canopus, and was told the Express version won't batch encode.


My question is - - does anyone know of another way to batch encode? 
Some other software, that isn't so expensive?</color>


<color><param>3333,3333,3333</param>thanks for any advice,</color>
