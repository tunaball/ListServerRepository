sure I am understanding the brochure for FCE.  It seems to suggest
that you can export to DVD but not to tape (via firewire to camera). 
Is that correct?  Doesn't seem to make sense to me.

It isn't labeled as an export. In FCP it is called "print to video" .
Probably the same in FCE.

 Alternatively, you can just set the quality high, the firewire out to
"all frames" and play it out.
