No Opinion here


DVD-R is VASTLY more compatible with most DVD players.

I do however put the following notice on short runs  DVD-R's for
clients.


<smaller>DVD-R  Note

Please note that recordable DVD’s are only compatible with around 90%
of DVD players.

If you experience problems please try this disc in another DVD player.</smaller>


Saying that if you use DVD+R discs the compatibility percentage
shrinks WAY DOWN for players over a year old

Newer than that and there is much more compatibility with DVD+R and
DVD-R

<excerpt>So do you other listmembers think that my bad experience

with a -R disc was just a problem with that one player?

Or should I consider switching to +R?
