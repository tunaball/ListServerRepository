<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> I know this has been asked before
many times so I apologise but what’s the best way to copy some content
from a DVD to put on website as Quicktime clips. It’s a home made DVD
no copyright issues but it was made on a PC from original mini DV
tape. It’s for a website I’m building for a comedy troupe and they
want to use the clips for promotion. I don’t think I can get the
original source tapes. </fontfamily>


<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> Thanx much</fontfamily>
