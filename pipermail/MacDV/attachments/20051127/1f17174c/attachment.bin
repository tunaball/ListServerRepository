I use Final Cut Pro and not iMovie at all, but there are likely many
similarities, so I'll try to help.


In FCP, you can unlink the audio tracks from the video by selecting
the clip in the timeline and then choosing Unlink under the Modify
menu. Then simply click once on the audio clip in the timeline to
select it (or stereo <italic><fixed>them</fixed></italic>) and hit the
delete button on your keyboard.


Second thought: In FCP, after unlinking and then deleting from the
timeline, the audio still exists in the Browser, so it can be used
again. To fill the empty sound space, I've used corresponding audio
edited in after the speed change so it plays back at normal speed.
Doesn't fit what's going on, but will match the ambience of the game.

of each game I put some slow motion highlights.  Normally what I do is
set the sound to zero with the slider bar and then I cover the dead
air with John WIlliams sound tracks.  Never had a problem with this in
Imovie 2 or 3.

 But in imovie 4 ( (1.8 G5 with 10.4) the sound is still there and in
slow motion sounds like cows approaching a slughter house.  I didn't
notice until I rendered highlights with no background music.  is this
a recognized problem with imovie 4.  The only workaround I have found
is to extract the sound and then delete it.
