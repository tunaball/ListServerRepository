Sorry for the very late reply.


Put those clips into their <bold>own</bold> sequence, <bold>select
that sequence</bold> in the Browser, then go to <bold>export</bold>
and export the <bold>Sequence</bold> in whatever format you need such
as Quicktime movie or compressed to mpeg2.

I select the clips but cannot seem to export just the clips. I know in
FCP 5 it's poss to highlight clips and "Reveal in Finder" but I cannot
find these clips with a search in 4.5. 


How do I go about this?
