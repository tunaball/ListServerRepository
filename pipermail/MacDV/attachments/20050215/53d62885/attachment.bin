Hi,


I'm pretty frustrated with a problem I'm having and I hope someone can
set me free.


I have several .mov files on my hard drive as well as my firewire
drives. These files are about 6gb.

I cannot copy them from one drive to another. Every single time it
stops at the 4gb mark with the error code of -36 and the message
"<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>The finder cannot complete
the operation because some data in 'clip.mov' could not be read or
written".


No matter which drive I use. I have swapped 3 firewire drives, changed
cables, used 3 different internal hard drives on my G4. Then the
problem is the same when I take it to the G4 iMac with other firewire
drives.


I simply can NOT move a quicktime file from one drive to another.

I have repaired permissions as well.


Has this happened to anyone else? The clip plays fine. I just need to
move them to different storage alternatives because I have so many
that I am turning into .wmv files so I need to keep moving them around
on different drives and making room.  But I can't move even one!


Any help out there?
