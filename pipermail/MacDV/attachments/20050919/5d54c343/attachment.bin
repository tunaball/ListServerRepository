Ok, I looked at your original post and this one.

 1st  Having done the major upgrade, are you also fully iLife 5 ?

Did you , having done the upgrade, then use a utility like Onyx or
System optimizer or macjanitor  or even

the  Mac disc utility to " repair permissions", and update the
"prebindings" . It's a good idea.

 Are your projects  from a former iMovie version? are all the clips
present ? Does it play in the view screen ?

 

Finally, You don't BURN an iMovie project to a DVD.  I'd guess this is
your problem.

You Export it to iDVD which prepares and burns the DVD. You don't use
discburner.

You let iDVD encode format and burn your DVD's.

You feed iDVD .dv files and jpegs  not mpeg.
