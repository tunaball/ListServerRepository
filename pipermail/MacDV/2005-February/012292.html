<PRE>I now remember what it was a couple years back. Do you have 'Put hard 
drive to sleep when possible' checked in your Energy Saver Preferences? 
If so, uncheck it and try again.

</I>&gt;<i> I have tried numerous clips. I have used firewire drives, internal

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No matter what, when I try to simply copy any random .mov quicktime 
</I>&gt;<i> file from a random drive to another to create more space for myself 
</I>&gt;<i> they all fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can copy a Quicken financial file, I can copy a Word document, I can

</I>&gt;<i> between discs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have 10 DVDs. I am ripping each one into .mov files by scene. 5 
</I>&gt;<i> scenes per DVD which means 5.mov files per DVD for a total of 50.mov 
</I>&gt;<i> files total. Then each .mov file is converted to .wmv files in 2 
</I>&gt;<i> minute sections. I will have hundreds of .wmv files when this is all 
</I>&gt;<i> done.
</I>&gt;<i> The whole process takes massive amounts of storage which is why I am 
</I>&gt;<i> using 3 or 4 drives for ripping and converting. But it's a real 
</I>&gt;<i> problem now to have ripped so many .mov files only to discover they 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be copied or moved to another drive for the conversion phase of 
</I>&gt;<i> the job.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One final note: I searched at Apple Discussions and found one other 
</I>&gt;<i> post from a month ago from someone who had the SAME problem. But no 
</I>&gt;<i> answer was given.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I know I am not the only one who has experienced this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps someone out there could try it themselves? Duplicate the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem and see if it happens? If you have a .mov quicktime file over 
</I>&gt;<i> 4gbs try and move it to another partition or drive.
