<PRE>Thanks for that suggestion. If I only had one .mov file in question 
that would be logical, however, this is happening with all of them and 
I have about 50. No matter which clip I choose (clip.mov) they will not 
copy from one drive to another. Each .mov clip is 6 to 7 gb but they 
all give the error at the 4gb mark.

I have tried numerous clips. I have used firewire drives, internal 
drives, and 2 different macs. I have changed firewire cables. I have 
repaired permissions.

No matter what, when I try to simply copy any random .mov quicktime 
file from a random drive to another to create more space for myself 
they all fail.

I can copy a Quicken financial file, I can copy a Word document, I can 
copy any number of Mac related files on my hard drives between each 
other quickly and effortlessly. But I cannot transfer .mov files 
between discs.

I have 10 DVDs. I am ripping each one into .mov files by scene. 5 
scenes per DVD which means 5.mov files per DVD for a total of 50.mov 
files total. Then each .mov file is converted to .wmv files in 2 minute 
sections. I will have hundreds of .wmv files when this is all done.
The whole process takes massive amounts of storage which is why I am 
using 3 or 4 drives for ripping and converting. But it's a real problem 
now to have ripped so many .mov files only to discover they cannot be 
copied or moved to another drive for the conversion phase of the job.

One final note: I searched at Apple Discussions and found one other 
post from a month ago from someone who had the SAME problem. But no 
answer was given.

So I know I am not the only one who has experienced this.

Perhaps someone out there could try it themselves? Duplicate the 
problem and see if it happens? If you have a .mov quicktime file over 
4gbs try and move it to another partition or drive.

Thanks again for all the help.

Kathy
