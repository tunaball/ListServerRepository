<PRE>I just googled error codes (<A HREF="http://www.ed.psu.edu/etc/mac/errors.html">http://www.ed.psu.edu/etc/mac/errors.html</A>) 
and got this pithy description of -36, &quot;ioErr&quot; which doesn't tell me 
anything but seems to suggest imput-output error. Whatever that is. . .

There used to be file size limits in older Mac OS's but I can't imagine 
6 gigs would be a problem now. I'm guessing that you have a corrupted 
file that for reasons beyond me, is too damaged for the finder to copy 
from one drive to another. Since it's always the same 4 gb spot of the 
file that it glitches on, I'm guessing that as you watch it, you'll 
find a glitch in the video around the 2/3rds mark. As a prior post 
suggested, maybe you can split the file before and after the glitch and 
copy it over in two parts.

A  workaround is to compress the file into a stuffit file and see if 
it'll copy over that way. Alternatively you can try puting the file 
into a disk image of it and see if it'll transfer. (dunno if the OS 
makes a disk image that big). Lastly, find a copy of the program Carbon 
Copy Cloner and use that to transfer the file. . .

Good luck!
