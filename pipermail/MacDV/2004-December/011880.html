<PRE>Just thought I'd post an update on a subject I raised a while back. I 
was wondering then whether you could take a pro analog video camera 
with 3 large CCDs and record the analog video output onto miniDV 
through an A/D converter.

I found a good deal on two JVC KY-15 cameras (built in '88) that look 
like brand new. For recording on miniDV, I looked for an inexpensive 
camcorder that would record video coming in through the S-Video jack. 
After much shopping, I settled on a JVC GRD70U. To test the idea, I set 
up an object in my home studio with plenty of light. I then used the 
small GRD70U to record the object - zooming in and out and using both 
auto and manual exposure. Then I switched the GRD70U to VTR mode, 
plugged in the S-Video output from the big JVC KY-15 and recorded the 
same object with the same variables.

The results exceeded my expectations. When played back on a monitor, 
the video from the older pro cameras looks better than anything I've 
seen from a digital camcorder - including my Sony TRV-900. It looks 
about ten times better than the video from the small GRD70U's camera 
lens. One catch - I don't need audio from these big cameras. If you do, 
you would have to find the right microphone and connectors to get the 
audio onto your miniDV tape.

I've seen one company's ad selling a hard disk designed for analog 
video cameras that has an A/D converter built in, but the prices start 
at about $1,300 - which is more than twice what you would pay for a 
good used analog camera, and four times what you would pay for a small 
used digital camcorder. JVC also sells a D9 recorder (aka Digital S) 
that will dock with the KY series cameras, but it sells for $6,000 new 
(and D9 tapes cost $120 each!). JVC claims that D9 is good enough to 
use in producing HD video, but I haven't found any info on whether D9 
can be made compatible with Final Cut Pro for editing.
