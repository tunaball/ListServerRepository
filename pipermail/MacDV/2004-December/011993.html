<PRE> Thanks for the help on the previous thread ( original) I'm starting a new
thread with this new issue...

 On the previous thread I learned that the garbage at the bottom came from
the analog tape... I ended up getting rid of this by cropping out a portion
of the bottom using the motion tab&gt;crop function.

 But I have another issue...

I am STILL using a Hollywood - D V bridge dazzle device to  convert /
import/video from my analog VHS.

When I import directly into it either iMovie or final cut pro, often the
horizontal alignment will get off center -  creating a line towards the
bottom and showing some of the top portion  below the line at the bottom...
Obviously messed up.

 This has nothing to do with the tracking on the VHS player ( I tried
several different decks - all have the same problem)...

-* Usually this happens after stopping and starting to VHS tape in the
player. * Also it can jump out of alignment at the point that the VHS tape
went from some footage to newly recorded footage on the tape...

 in iMovie -  I am able to usually get rid of this bad alignment problem by
either hitting stops then play in iMovie -  or if need be - jumping out of
the camera ready tab - to iMovie - then back to the camera ready position -
a fairly easy process to correct.

- however, as stated above if the segment of the recorded VHS tape goes into
action as soon as it was put into record originally -  then first - as soon
as it gets to that position - it will jump out of alignment - so there's no
way that I can get the beginning of the segment - and have to start a VHS
after that point - losing the first 5 or 10 seconds of the beginning.

 final cut pro 4.5 -  is much more temperamental then iMovie in this case...
When it gets out of alignment ...  Nothing I have tried - including closing
the capture window and reopening it and many other little tricks help much
... And often I have to entirely quit final cut pro ...  And reload it and
try again...

*** Question: bottom line- this problem is very annoying. I'm wondering if
my older Hollywood dazzle interface (300.00 a few years ago) is somehow
contributing to the problem. Is anyone else having this type of analog VHS
import problem? One another brand of  analog video interface do a better
job?

Some people have recommended this...

- is in better?

Or the : PYRO a/v link?

 I am prepared to buy something new but I would love to hear some advice
first from folks on this list.
