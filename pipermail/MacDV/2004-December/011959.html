<PRE>Sorry for the delayed response. I assume the discussion about the 
slideshow pricing was referring to my query.

It's not actually DVD slideshows although I just did 5 for a Wedding 
DVD. The project that I am querying about is actually an 
audio-narrated project idea I'm pitching to a U.S. company, and it's 
for the web. It will be audio based from an interview I do over the 
phone, digitized, and then I'll &quot;art direct&quot; the photos to be taken 
for me, since the subjects are out of town, and then have it 
delivered to me and then I do the slideshow for later posting on the 
web to promote a project.

Responding to Ted: No color corrections, etc. unless needed but I am 
going to aim to do zooms/pans/rotates to make the show kinetic. I may 
also dip back into Photoshop for neato SFX because I took a course 
and want to remember all that I learned.

I must be vague because I don't want the specifics of the project to 
get out! :)

But essentially, this is a new concept and I don't want to over (or 
under) charge so I wanted a ballpark figure. Someone on this group 
previously mentioned $250 per slideshow. That, to me, is too much. 
I'm currently aiming for something like $150 US per show, but will 
likely provide a small discount, and so that our package deal of 
about 5 shows isn't too hefty for the company. I want to grow with 
these guys so I want them to be happy...

Thanks for all the replies. I must tender the pricing ASAP! I'm 
already overdue because I'm waffling on this.
</PRE>
