<PRE>There's some new news on the eMac front:

  <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/emac/">http://www.apple.com/emac/</A>

Apple's dropped the price of the top end emac to $999 upped the G4 
processor speed to 1.25 MHz for both the Superdrive AND CD burn/read 
drives.  The CD burner model is now $799.

The new machines have USB 2.0 ports, and use faster RAM, among other 
differences from the older models.

Check out <A HREF="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/archives/apr04/041304.html">http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/archives/apr04/041304.html</A> for 
other details, including a report that the DVD burner will cook at 8X.

Prices on the 1GHz machines with Superdrive and 256MB Ram are now under 
  $899 at Frys, perhaps because of the price changes.

A Google search for eMac problems turned up a few that appear to have 
been identified and fixed.  Nothing to indicate a large range of 
problems, and it would appear from a quick scan that the units affected 
were not recent.

There WAS a raster shift problem that involves a cable, and the fix is 
to replace the cable.  Macfixit.com has details.

<A HREF="http://www.macfixit.com/staticpages/index.php?page=20030131071918881">http://www.macfixit.com/staticpages/index.php?page=20030131071918881</A>

Perhaps the posters below could check into what brought the machines 
into the shop mentioned,  what the problem(s) were, and what models/age 
of machines were affected.

That's more useful than blanket statements from un-named sources that 
&quot;eMacs are major bad.&quot;

I'm QUITE happy with my 1GHz Superdrive eMac and will continue to 
suggest them as a viable option for someone looking to do as our 
original poster with the 350MHz machine wanted to do on an $800 or so 
budget.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which quickly degrades internal components. also, because the speakers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shifts. apples trying to dump them.&lt;&lt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just FYI...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The college I teach at has had 40 + eMacs operating 24/7 for over 2 
</I>&gt;<i> years
</I>&gt;<i> and we've had no problems at all ... in fact they've been so rock 
</I>&gt;<i> solid I've
</I>&gt;<i> been contemplating getting one for myself and have recommended them to
</I>&gt;<i> several friends/family members/students. I find the displays clear and
</I>&gt;<i> stable without jitter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, these were first (or maybe second?) generation 700Mhz
</I>&gt;<i> models with the combo drives. Perhaps the later high speed models do 
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> more heat generation and/or other design flaws that cause problems, 
</I>&gt;<i> though
</I>&gt;<i> your post is the first I've seen on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would be interested in more information on the newer model's

</I>&gt;<i> before making a decision.
