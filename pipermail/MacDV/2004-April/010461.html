<PRE>I really don't know what all you people are talking bout . My stills 
look fine.Transported by memory stick fom a TRV900 to iPhoto , iMovie 
and then FCP.
If you in-house people would hire people like me we'd all be happier.

</I>&gt;<i> I just prepared a still image video presentation for a Sales 
</I>&gt;<i> Conference at my company.  I have a brand new G5 at home, and a Dell 
</I>&gt;<i> Laptop with Premiere on it at work.  I couldn't decide whether I 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to do the project during my off hours at home on my beautiful 
</I>&gt;<i> G5, or at work on my annoying Dell.  Finally, the need to spend hours 
</I>&gt;<i> and hours and on the project forced me to do it at work.  I used both 
</I>&gt;<i> stills and videos from various sources, added music and all kinds of 
</I>&gt;<i> special effects to give the video 'jazz'.  I exported first as a 
</I>&gt;<i> Quicktime DV movie and the result was terrible.  Pixelization similar 
</I>&gt;<i> to what you describe below.  Then I exported as an mpg using the divx 
</I>&gt;<i> codec making sure I exported to a DV size (720 x 480, I believe it 
</I>&gt;<i> was), frame rate for NTSC 29.97 and I also de-interlaced because many 
</I>&gt;<i> of the forums I'm on point to interlacing as a cause of problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The result played beautifully on my Dell Laptop.   I burned a DVD 
</I>&gt;<i> using DVDit.   Burned with no problems.  I tested it on a large screen 
</I>&gt;<i> Sony XBR TV because I know if any pixelization or anything funky  is 
</I>&gt;<i> going to show up, it will show up there.  That TV is a digital ready 
</I>&gt;<i> monster that brings out the flaws in even the best professionally made 
</I>&gt;<i> DVD, and I know my project is going to be shown on a projector and 
</I>&gt;<i> blown up 50 fold in size.  The result was fine.  Not as crystal clear 
</I>&gt;<i> as it looked on the computer monitor, but damn good.  The only images 
</I>&gt;<i> that showed any 'noise' were those images that I knew were not of the 
</I>&gt;<i> best quality anyway, and I expected they wouldn't look the best.  
</I>&gt;<i> There was occasionally a hint of pixelization between transitions, but 
</I>&gt;<i> barely enough to complain about and probably wouldn't be noticeable to 
</I>&gt;<i> someone who wasn't looking for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Between the posts of problems with iDVD4 and now this post, it seems 
</I>&gt;<i> my beautiful G5 would have probably given me nothing but headaches if 
</I>&gt;<i> I had tried to do the project on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Believe me when I tell you, working in Premiere on my Dell is no easy 
</I>&gt;<i> thing.  Playback in the project is never good; rendering in order to 
</I>&gt;<i> see transitions takes forever (I had transitions, motion, blue screen 
</I>&gt;<i> - all kinds of things on in over 200 images).
</I>&gt;<i> Rendering the final output took 1 hour with divx (and the file size 
</I>&gt;<i> was an acceptable 68mgs as opposed to the 1.5G that produced using 
</I>&gt;<i> Quicktime).  Burning the DVD (~6 minute movie) took 10 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, is it safe to conclude I should:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stay away from iMovie for still image projects.  I have FCP, but would 
</I>&gt;<i> have probably used iMovie because of its links to iPhoto and iDVD.
</I>&gt;<i> Keep my fingers crossed when using iDVD4 as it may or may not be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to burn a DVD (and whether it will or won't seems to depend upon the 
</I>&gt;<i> Gods)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I'm not a fan of Windows and Premiere because of the horrible 
</I>&gt;<i> trouble I've had doing projects.  I've had Premiere loaded on many 
</I>&gt;<i> different computers, each one faster and faster with more power, more 
</I>&gt;<i> RAM etc.    But never did Premiere work as smoothly and beautifully as 
</I>&gt;<i> iMovie and FCP work on my G5.  This being said, what good is it if I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> not going to be able to get acceptable output?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one, of many problems, is due to the fact that DVD is compressed and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are watching it from a projector...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you try to watch a DVD on a large screen, pixelization occurs = 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good idea...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you want to view your &quot;movie&quot; using a projector, try to play it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tape, first choice would be DV CAM, then miniDV, then D8, then VHS 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tape...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> try it for yourself...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and let me know if you see a difference...
