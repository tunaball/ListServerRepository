<PRE>Hi everyone:

Thanks for the comments on my original posting -- here's the update. I
burned a couple more DVDs and there was no background noise; the photos are
still a bit rough and the sound fluctuates a bit, but my group thought it
was ok. However, the client saw it yesterday and isn't satisfied with the
quality. We're using a new state-of-the-art LCD projector, so the equipment
isn't the problem. However, the IT group (who &quot;know nothing about Macs&quot;)
think it might be the software (iMovie and iDVD) doesn't render as well as
professional software such as Pinnacle Express. And that I'm using Quicktime
movies. Eeeep! So we're sending the DVD to a production house for advice on
improving the quality. If there's anything helpful, I'll share it.

Paula

Paula,
I've experienced the same poor quality still images on my recent 
videos.  I used stills from my Olympus C720 (shot at highest quality), 
and they appear very bitmapped on the resulting DVD I burned. Well, 
they appear very bitmapped EXCEPT during the transition phases from one 
clip (still, title or video) to another. during the transitions, they 
look perfectly normal.  This problem appears whether I'm watching it on 
a Mac, a 51-inch Toshiba projection TV, or a 36-inch Sony TV.  No one 
here has been able to adequately suggest a course of action or a 
possible cause for this issue.  I burned one DVD normally (i.e. 
creating an iDVD project straight from iMovie 4), and a second DVD by 
exporting the iMovie to a .dv file, then importing that file into iDVD 
and burning. I had the same amount of pixelation in both DVDs. Wish I 
could help more... I'm stuck commiserating with you.  I'm continuing to 
search for answers and will share anything constructive I find.
Randy
