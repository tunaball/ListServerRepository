<PRE>This sync issue happens if the DV camera is 
recording 12 bit audio AND/OR the recording 
speed is LP. It shouldn't be an issue at all 
when you use 16 bit audio &amp; SP recording 
speed in camera. I have literally hundreds of 
mini-dv dubs from S-VHS, Hi-8, or Beta sources.

FYI - Even though I have a canopus converter, 
I often move to DV first so that all of the 
&quot;original&quot; footage has timecode on an 
archival tape. That allows you to log and 
capture in FCP without filling up a hard 
drive with junk.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>has to do will create undue wear and tear on the transport mechanism of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>his camera.   He does not want to purchase a conversion unit such as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Canopus as it will become redundant once he has copied his VHS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>collection across to DVD.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As another list member mentioned, if the Sony DV camcorder is a fairly
</I>&gt;<i> recent model it should have a pass-thru mode, which means they can bypass
</I>&gt;<i> the tape (saving wear and tear) and record directly to the computer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately the Sony Digital 8mm model I have (TRV-315) does not have
</I>&gt;<i> pass-thru, so I opted to do exactly as your friend - copy my VHS tapes to
</I>&gt;<i> Digital 8mm and then capture them into Final Cut Pro. *WARNING HERE* After
</I>&gt;<i> spending a huge amount of time transferring all my family footage to DV
</I>&gt;<i> tapes, I began the process of capturing and editing.  Any footage that was
</I>&gt;<i> captured into FCP from those tapes would consistently lose audio/video sync
</I>&gt;<i> within a minute or two! I checked every setting in FCP regarding sample
</I>&gt;<i> rates, audio/video sync, striped the tape with blank TC, etc. and no
</I>&gt;<i> solution. Posted a number of messages on this list and no one else could
</I>&gt;<i> seem to nail it down either. No problems with sync playing back directly
</I>&gt;<i> from the tape on the camcorder, and no problem with capturing tapes that
</I>&gt;<i> were recorded with the camcorder. Only tapes that were recorded using the
</I>&gt;<i> RCA line-in jacks seem to be affected, or older 8mm/Hi8mm tapes that I was
</I>&gt;<i> directly converting to digital.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One temporary work-around has been to record from the camcorder into iMovie
</I>&gt;<i> first (which &gt;doesn't&lt; lose the audio/video sync) then export as a Quicktime
</I>&gt;<i> DV file and import into Final Cut Pro. If I output this Quicktime from FCP
</I>&gt;<i> back to tape via Firewire, I could capture the resulting footage from that
</I>&gt;<i> tape WITHOUT SYNC PROBLEMS!!!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Suggest to your friend that he go through the whole process (capturing and
</I>&gt;<i> editing) to check for this before wasting countless hours of time (and
</I>&gt;<i> wearing out the camcorder) like I did. Hopefully, he will discover that his
</I>&gt;<i> camcorder has pass-thru and won't have to worry about this issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>His wife works as a teacher and she took
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>one of his VHS tapes to school and burnt it to DVD on a DVD recorder
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>there.    The resultant disc plays OK on both his home DVD player and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>also on his iMac.   However,  when he attempts to transfer the content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to FCP4 , or iMovie 4 for editing/cleanup purposes,  the video is OK ,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>but there is no sound.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>We have tried passing the DVD's  content through DVD Backup and DVD2one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>X,  but only end up with the same files as we started with on the DVD.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Is there any way of getting the DVD's audio into either FCP , or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>iMovie, or does he have to fall back on the slow, laborious task of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>passing his VHS content through his DVD camera ?.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>TIA

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There &gt;are&lt; solutions to convert the DVD's MPEG-2 format back to DV (which
</I>&gt;<i> he'll need to do to edit in FCP), but the problem with that is the original
</I>&gt;<i> video footage has incurred lossy compression going to MPEG-2, and if he were
</I>&gt;<i> to convert it back to DV for editing and then output back to MPEG-2 for DVD
</I>&gt;<i> again, there will be a cumulative loss of quality.
