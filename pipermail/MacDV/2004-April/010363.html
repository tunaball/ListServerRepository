You are right...even headstones discovered 3rd Century BCE.  When was the
Synagogue at Herculaneum established?  Oldest synagogue in Western Europe I
know of was in Ostia, a port of Rome, around 100AD.  It was excavated in
1961.  All neither here nor there.  He wasn't called &quot;Jesus&quot; in his day, and
given that and the fact that there were Spanish Jews, we are both saying
that the argument asserting he wasn't because of the Spanish name is
fatuous.

&gt;&gt;<i> Oh, and at the time Y'shua walked the Earth, in Hebrew (or Aramaic, whatever

Similarities are so pervasive that the issue is moot.  Particularly in
regard to the names.

&gt;<i> Not touching the theological issues, -- Erica
</I>
In Hebrew and Aramaic, the name of God changes gender all over the place.
Renders the Trinity a rather patriarchal invention, arguably.

Anybody know what digital techniques Gibson used in &quot;The Passion&quot;?

Looks like the film is about to become the 5th highest US grossing film of
all time.  Amazing.
