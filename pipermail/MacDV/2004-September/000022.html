<PRE>Gregg-- thanks for the response. I am currently working thru PCI FW 
card  (forgotten what it is) and I think I have already tried the 
internal FW ports but will retry and try some of your other 
suggestions-- will get back on it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Karl &amp; Bernard--thanks for your responses-- now there are 3 of us with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar problems exporting the finished iMovie back to tape. It sounds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like our problems are similar but different.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My end product as I export to tape looks like a jigsaw puzzle for a 6
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> year-old--that is, big chunks that have interlocking edges(as seen in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the LCD). When I actually play that tape back it almost looks OK but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isn't. It shifts and shimmys as it plays.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have been following this thread a little bit and have some 
</I>&gt;<i> observations. I
</I>&gt;<i> had exactly what you described above (the &quot;jigsaw puzzle&quot; video on 
</I>&gt;<i> output) a
</I>&gt;<i> number of years ago when I first jumped into the DV fray. This was 
</I>&gt;<i> with an
</I>&gt;<i> older Umax clone (604e) using a third party Firewire card (Orange 
</I>&gt;<i> Micro). To
</I>&gt;<i> get things working I eventually had to upgrade my computer with a 
</I>&gt;<i> G4/400
</I>&gt;<i> daughter card and finally found the culprit was the sluggish Orange 
</I>&gt;<i> Micro
</I>&gt;<i> Firewire card, so replaced that with a VST card and all was good - 
</I>&gt;<i> sort of.
</I>&gt;<i> I got the &quot;blocky&quot; video when I tried to upgrade to FCP3, but iMovie 2 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> FCP2 still work for me on OS9. All my research pointed to a limitation 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the bus speed and bus timing issues (this old clone has a bus speed of 
</I>&gt;<i> 45Mhz
</I>&gt;<i> - slowwww) as being the main culprits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All that being said, I find it unbelievable that the three of you are 
</I>&gt;<i> having
</I>&gt;<i> similar problems with the machines you now have (don't have the 
</I>&gt;<i> original
</I>&gt;<i> posts anymore, but I seem to recall at least G4/G5 machines with 1GHZ+
</I>&gt;<i> cpu's, one even a DP!). Even the old B&amp;W G3/400's with native FW 
</I>&gt;<i> support
</I>&gt;<i> eliminated this problem for most people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't recall seeing this in the original posts, but what are you 
</I>&gt;<i> recording
</I>&gt;<i> you're video to/from - internal HDs or external FW drives? I know 
</I>&gt;<i> there have
</I>&gt;<i> been issues in the past with some setups when you try to import/export 
</I>&gt;<i> DV
</I>&gt;<i> between the camera and a FW hard drive. Some users found that using 
</I>&gt;<i> separate
</I>&gt;<i> FW ports helped; others mentioned that the problem was solved when they
</I>&gt;<i> daisy chained the camera through the FW hard drive's second port. Disk
</I>&gt;<i> fragmentation can also be an issue, particularly if you're streaming 
</I>&gt;<i> to/from
</I>&gt;<i> the same drive your OS/Apps are on. Hopefully your using a separate 
</I>&gt;<i> drive
</I>&gt;<i> (or at least partition) for your DV.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In watching this list and studying video--I hear references to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;stuttering&quot; and drop-outs, but I am not sure what these really look
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like. Is that what I have? The problem has to be in the computer--tho
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything seems OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stuttering and dropouts are a little different. When I use FCP3 with 
</I>&gt;<i> OSX on
</I>&gt;<i> my old beast, I get this ... the video and audio stops/starts 
</I>&gt;<i> intermittently
</I>&gt;<i> (the audio sounds like sounds like someone stuttering) and eventually 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> two go out of sync. This is most likely because my machine's CPU just 
</I>&gt;<i> can't
</I>&gt;<i> keep up with the task at hand, although this issue can also happen 
</I>&gt;<i> with a
</I>&gt;<i> hard drive that is too slow.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are there any suggestions of what I could try in respect to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computer?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> John in Tucson
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I agree that it does sound like a hardware issue, it is possible 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> there may be a software problem with iMovie export as there are now at 
</I>&gt;<i> least
</I>&gt;<i> three of you having similar problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you could post more details (ie what drive you are 
</I>&gt;<i> recording/playing
</I>&gt;<i> video from) etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, you're using fairly recent Apple hardware and Apple software. I 
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> try to put the ball back in their court - maybe take the machine back 
</I>&gt;<i> to the
</I>&gt;<i> vendor you purchased it from to see if they can help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this post helps in some way.
