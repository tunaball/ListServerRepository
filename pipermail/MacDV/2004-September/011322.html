<PRE>Experts:

In the good old days I used to use System 9.2 with Toast 5.  After I installed toast the
pop-up menu associated with imovie's 2.0 Quicktime Export had two new Toast Options (NTSC
and PAL).  The exported video CD content was of good quality.  The non-toast option was a
little raunchy but when Toast was launched (usually with multiple files) it would somehow
convert it and I could burn these nifty Video CD's since I did not have nor could I
afford a DVD burner.  I think the normal Quicktime CD ROM setting is a little more
compact (by about 20%).

I finally upgraded to OSX and Toast 6 and made a super VCD with toast.  I think I used
the Export to DV from imovie3 and then when I used Toast it did the encoding for me.
Not all DVD players are Super VCD compatible but mine is and the quality was good, indeed
better than a Video CD or conventional VHS

So when the CD Burner got tired I bought the Pioneer A08 DVD burner and installed it in
my G4 and made my first DVD.  However I still want to do Video CD's particularly using
old files (Quicktime from imovie/toast).  However for some reason Toast 6.0 somehow
wanted to re-encode my perfectly good MPEG-1 files that were previously played fine with
Toast 5.  And when I checked the quality it was incredibly bad.  What is this ? MPEG .55
?

Backing up for a minute, why doesn't imovie 4 have an export to Quicktime for Video CD
imovie 3 does have a CD ROM quality export but this encoder seems to produce video that
is lower quality than good old Toast 5 on a 9.2 system.  It's akin to normal CDROM with
Toast 5

I must say I like the old paradigm of making a real Quicktime movie that is a file, the
encoding is done separate from the burning that's the way it should be.  Can MPEG
Streamclip 1.1 solve this problem?  Why doesn't apple support the export option anymore?
They should get away from the ionly solution.  The interchange is great between
imovie/iDVD/iphoto but give me some control and don't mislead me with an 18 Kbyte file
labeled Final_DVD.  That's a link to something else !!

BTW: I am a little disappointed in the Video Quality of the Toast produced DVD's.  Is the
encoder in Apples iDVD(which I don't own yet) better that in Toast 6.

I resisted the temptation to go direct to some of the wonderful experts (TIA) on this
list.  Thought some others might be having the same problems.
