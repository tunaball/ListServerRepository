I purchased an OWC Mercury Elite FW drive about a year and 3 months ago. I
had to send the drive back twice because of a faulty FW bridge (the drive
was fine as could be seen by the USB port). A few weeks after the warranty
period, this third case died on me  - not gonna go there! Flaky FW bridges.

So I took the 80GB IBM drive out and installed it in a cheap generic case,
which coincidentally looks exactly like a WeibeTech enclosure (it's probably
manufactured by the same company). So far so good - two months and counting
...  ;). I purchased the 5 1/4&quot; case w/fan so I could also use the case for
a Pioneer DVD burner. This keeps the hard drive significantly cooler than
the OWC case, although it is more cumbersome.
