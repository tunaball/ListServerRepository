<PRE>Kathi &amp; alia,

While this is &quot;true&quot;, and it is certainly better to support the weight 
of a camera with a vest attachment, this doesn't begin to touch the 
functional issue of a steadicam. Your big assumption here, and it is 
quite incorrect, is that the camera unit is stationary. No one holds a 
steadicam in one fixed place, arm extended. That is the purpose of a 
shoulder brace, and not a steadicam (and hand-held shots, by the way, 
should always be taken with the arms *not* extended, but rather tucked 
into the body as closely as possible). The very principle of a 
steadicam set-up is that the camera will be *moving* in a predetermined 
path, and it is this simple fact that is the reason Steadicams were 
made in the first place. The purpose of the gimbal device in steadicams 
is not to &quot;hold the picture steady&quot;; rather, it is to stabilize a 
picture already in motion. It is, in effect, a small shock absorber, 
and while shock absorbers on cars do not by any means hold the car 
steady, they certainly make for a more fluid ride by softening the 
smaller and slightly larger shocks to the vehicle. So it is with the 
gimbal. The gimbal absorbs the shocks that would make a tracking shot 
flutter distractingly, and smooths out the actual lateral and vertical 
motion of the tracking. It doesn't stop such motion, nor does it need 
to, any more than a shock absorber stops a car from moving. The point 
is minimization of unnecessary movement, rather than cessation of all 
movement. Too, remember that Steadicams were devised for 20-30 lb 35mm 
cameras, not the 2-5 pound MiniDV cameras which move indiscreetly far 
more than cinema cameras because of their lighter weight. Inertia and 
all that.

Furthermore, the average length of a take in any independent film I 
have seen is nowhere near the length of time I can hold an unmounted 
steadicam or a camera on a shoulder mount. In fact, the average length 
of a shot in american cinema is closer to 4.3 seconds, so I don't 
honestly think anyone is really worried about duration. The number of 
Steadicam shots compared to hand-held or tripod shots is minuscule. 
Steadicams are for very few shots in the long run of a feature, and 
there is plenty of time throughout the process of shooting a feature to 
recover from the 15 minutes of steadicam work in the much longer 
process of shooting tripod shots. And a moving steadicam wears less on 
the muscles than a non-moving one, by far.

There seems to be a big misunderstanding about what a Steadicam really 
does, or is used for. I think many people believe that &quot;steadicam&quot; is 
simply a system for stabilizing a hand-held shot, and that just isn't 
true. A shoulder mount would serve much better for most people's needs 
in simple hand-held photography. Steadicams and Glidecams are very 
specialized stabilizers. You can remind your folks at Birns &amp; Sawyer of 
that point for me--please. The very point of most homemade stabilizers 
is simply to keep from bankrupting a poor indie filmmaker who only 
needs a certain type of handheld travelling shot once in awhile for 
his/her imaginative cinematography. Or you can spend $5,000 for an 
official (Birns &amp; Sawyer approved, I'm sure) Steadicam mini setup, at 
which point you've already wasted your half your lifetime film budget 
as an indie filmmaker. Or buy a $300 shoulder mount from Birns &amp; 
Sawyer, rather than building your own for the $25 that mine cost. Or a 
Steadicam Jr. for $500 from somewhere else.

Take anything that a business person tells you with a grain of salt, 
especially when it comes to products in which that person has a vested 
(sorry, couldn't resist a pun) interest.
