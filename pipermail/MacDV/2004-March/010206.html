<PRE>Thanks to everyone who helped.  Based on all input, this seems to be 
what's happened.

I know the source of the virus.  It came from someone I was expecting a 
contract from.  I tried to open the attachment assuming it was the 
contract.  Later I found out he sent the email but not with an 
attachment.

Unaware that I was infected - I'm pretty sure the virus piggybacked on 
my email to at least three people I emailed (all PC users).

Now, none of my external hard drives work with this computer for 
downloading Final Cut Pro anymore.  Plus my emac OS 10.2.8 is still 
sluggish even after being repairing with disk utility (it says the Emac 
is fine), it looks like Gregg's experience with a PC virus is what's 
happened to me:
Gregg said:
&quot;It was a fairly easy fix using Virex, but it did wipe out my system 
file and it took about two full days to troubleshoot and get things 
back to normal.&quot;

I will mention Final Cut Pro won't work worth a dam now so it looks 
like I'm going to have to reinstall everything from scratch.  Plus 
that'll kill the PC virus.  Appleworks is also sluggish but Photoshop 
seems to be working fine.

I've updated Norten twice (three days ago and again now), so hopefully 
it will help, though it just seems to update the same files over and 
over.

Though there aren't any 'Mac viruses' as such, this PC virus has cost 
me some time.  Since Antivirus for Mac won't recognize PC viruses or 
get rid of them, (now I'm wondering why I bought it) I will never open 
another attachment again.

Lynn
