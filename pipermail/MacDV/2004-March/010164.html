<PRE>Steve,

What you're actually looking for is a &quot;cable leased commercial access&quot;  
channel. Cable systems that have more than a certain number of  
&quot;activated&quot; channels (usually 36 or more) are required to reserve 10%  
or 15% of their activated channel capacity for leased commercial  
access.

Its a resource not publicized by cable companies, and not very well  
known.

This requirement allows unaffiliated producers with commercially  
supported programs to obtain a one-shot half-hour, on up to a full  
channel, 24/7.

You simply write to the cable company requesting rates, terms and  
conditions. See the links below. There's a specific section about  
what's required from you to create a &quot;bona fide&quot; request, and what the  
cable company is obliged to do in response.

I suspect you could write ONE letter to the main office of a  
multiple-system operator like Comcast or Cox, and list the towns or  
systems you want to use.

The law's intention is to make access available at a relatively low  
cost. The regulations have specific formula for determining rates, so  
there's a way to check (spreadsheet sugggested) whether the rate being  
quoted is more than what it should be... and processes for resolving  
disputes. (Bring on the CPA's!)

If you opt to use leased access, make sure that you don't get gouged  
when it comes to getting your tape played back, or arranging other  
delivery methods.  Cable operators are limited in how much they can  
charge.

Rather than paying a &quot;per playback&quot; fee, it might be cheaper for you to  
provide your own playback system and rent space in the company's head  
end.  There are hard-drive equipped MPEG-2 playback boxes that can be  
rack mounted, hooked up to a DSL connection and fed programs for timed  
playback.

If they won't rent space inside the head end (which might be illegal if  
they provide that kind of support to others) you might be able to  
arrange to have your own small equipment shelter next door, and run the  
signal through a conduit to their building.

See these links for details, which are contained in the FCC rules and  
regulations under the parts listed in the section covering cable TV:

edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/octqtr/pdf/47cfr76.977.pdf

I'd also suggest that you do a search on the FCC website  
(<A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov">http://www.fcc.gov</A>) for &quot;Cable leased commercial access&quot; and read the  
various items that pop up.  That will familiarize you with some of the  
issues LCA programmers have had with cable operators, and what the FCC  
decided.  It will better prepare you for helping get what you want.

Many cable sales and management people have no clue about Leased  
Commercial Access, so it might not hurt to print out the first four PDF  
files, highlight appropriate sections and provide them with your rate  
request.

Hope this helps.
