</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [MacDV] Re: Steadicam and Money Shots
</I>&gt;<i> Date: Sun, 7 Mar 2004 13:00:58 -0800
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just  thought I'd put my two cents in on this issue. I am a certified
</I>&gt;<i> Steadicam operator (trained by Garrett Brown, Steadicam's inventor,
</I>&gt;<i> long before the company was sold) as well as an owner of the Steadicam
</I>&gt;<i> Jr. for DV cameras.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Steadicam shots are all about sophisticated dolly shots impractical for
</I>&gt;<i> dolly crews. They also save time and money on indie features because a
</I>&gt;<i> good operator CAN get reasonable lock-offs (witness the multi minute
</I>&gt;<i> end of long Steadicam shot lock off in the interview scene in &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> Shining&quot;) while also simulating crane moves with simple cherry pickers,
</I>&gt;<i> and generally do fun stuff like going up and down stairs smoothly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Center of gravity is the focus of Steadicam operation. Whether you are
</I>&gt;<i> home brewing a Steadicam-like devise, or renting one at some time, the
</I>&gt;<i> object is to keep the center of gravity of you AND your rig as close as
</I>&gt;<i> possible to being simple downward pressure on your feet. Anytime you do
</I>&gt;<i> moves with the rig away from your body, well, get out the Doan's Pills
</I>&gt;<i> for the coming backaches. Operating a Steadicam or clone thereof is
</I>&gt;<i> more like a tango with the rig as your partner. The rig stays as close
</I>&gt;<i> as possible to your body to keep the weight over your feet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As to the Steadicam Jr., as others suggest, your arm may work for a
</I>&gt;<i> short time, but eventually, you succumb to the weight of a PD150 or the
</I>&gt;<i> DVX-100 (which requires EXTRA weight on the sled to balance [wireless
</I>&gt;<i> receivers work well with velcro in this instance] the thing.) There's
</I>&gt;<i> also a problem with panning (Steadicams LOVE to pan, tilt, boom a
</I>&gt;<i> little, and such in the &quot;real&quot; world) on the Jr. because the control
</I>&gt;<i> surface is too small - you find it too easy to disrupt the flow and
</I>&gt;<i> create an annoying yaw, even a rocking yaw as the unit settles itself.
</I>&gt;<i> There's also not quite enough size in the sled to inhibit yaw in the
</I>&gt;<i> first place. That all said, when the Steadicam Jr. works (YOU do
</I>&gt;<i> everything right) it passes for the real thing in DV. It also collapses
</I>&gt;<i> quickly and makes a decent shoulder mount.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Over time, doing a lot of shots with a Steadicam Jr. - you find the
</I>&gt;<i> operator's muscles begin to lock from the oppressive weight of the rig,
</I>&gt;<i> you begin to see a sine wave &quot;pulsing&quot; as the horizon smoothly moves up
</I>&gt;<i> and down in correlation with the footsteps the operator is attempting
</I>&gt;<i> to remove.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now that the patent has run out, apparently, on the Steadicam, the
</I>&gt;<i> generics are beginning to abound. There were many &quot;steadiclones&quot; at the
</I>&gt;<i> NAB show last year, even a sexy one from Sachtler, and so, I should
</I>&gt;<i> think someone will put out a pro DV/DVCAM steadirig which features 1)
</I>&gt;<i> the addition of MASS to the DV camera [heavy as a PD150, DVX-100, or
</I>&gt;<i> the less professional XL1 are, they are not heavy enough to emulate the
</I>&gt;<i> stability equation of a big film camera]  2) a vest and iso-elastic arm
</I>&gt;<i> with spring tension appropriate to the lighter overall weight, and 3) a
</I>&gt;<i> set of accessories for low mode, radio focus, proper docking, vehicle
</I>&gt;<i> rigs, and the like. This, of course, assumes the camera owner has
</I>&gt;<i> already purchased wide angle capability - standard stuff for human
</I>&gt;<i> mounted Steadicams (but not really needed in vehicle mounts!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dispensing with the idea of Steadicam for a minute, the independent
</I>&gt;<i> producer can get a lot of bang for the buck by picking up a good used
</I>&gt;<i> wheelchair. Smooth floors and wheelchairs are a great &quot;poor man's
</I>&gt;<i> dolly.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also useful to add visual dynamics to a show: jib arms, which  can add
</I>&gt;<i> their own stable motion, panning, tilting, and booming with smooth
</I>&gt;<i> lock-offs. You can design shots with the boom arm in mind which can get
</I>&gt;<i> actors walking and talking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Poor man's track dolly: skateboard wheels mounted to an angle iron so
</I>&gt;<i> as to ride on PVC pipe. A small wood platform with such wheels, then
</I>&gt;<i> add your boom-equipped tripod (tie it down!) and suddenly, slick images
</I>&gt;<i> at little cost. Smaller versions of this technology can make for
</I>&gt;<i> interesting tight interiors shooting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, with the small size of the PD150 and DVX-100,  practicing
</I>&gt;<i> handheld operation is well worth the time, and perhaps investment in
</I>&gt;<i> time and experimentation in finding what handheld rigs work best for
</I>&gt;<i> you. Handheld is the stuff of kinetics, which can add to drama.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, 'nuff said for now,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Richard Brown

Richard,

Thanks for a pro's info and viewpoint!
