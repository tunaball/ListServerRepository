Lynn, just to clarify, I was talking about a fixing a Mac virus with Virex,
not a PC virus. As many have mentioned, a Windows/PC coded virus will not
affect the Mac operating system. I can &gt;almost&lt; guarantee (never say never)
that your external drive issue is completely separate from the apparent
spreading of a PC virus from your computer to others.

About all you can do for the latter (preventing the spread of the virus) is
to delete any dubious e-mails with attachments (ie your contractors).
Realistically, it is your PC-using contacts' responsibility to have virus
protection on their machines ... you are a minimal risk to them compared
with other PC users and sites they are in contact with.

As for your external drive issue, if both FW drives are exhibiting the same
problems, it is likely not a drive problem but probably a FW port (hardware)
or software issue.

Out of curiousity, how much free drive space is available on your internal
System drive?
