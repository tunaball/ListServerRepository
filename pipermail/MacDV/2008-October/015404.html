<PRE>I don't have iMovie8, but thought I could find the answer for you 
on the net. The answer I found is dumbfounding -- as you've 
discovered there is no record to camera option in iMovie8!!!

most people seem to be going back to iMovie 6, which you can 
download for free as an iMovie8 owner.
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/imovieHD6.html">http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/imovieHD6.html</A>


If going to iMovie6 is not an option for you, there is a little 
free program from Apple that will let you play quicktime movies 
out your firewire ports to the Canopus box. It's called Simple 
Video Out. There is a good article about it here, and there is 
the link to download the software in the article too:
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/5uvnc">http://tinyurl.com/5uvnc</A>


You would have your students edit in iMovie8, save to a Quicktime 
movie. The Getting Started manual for iMovie8 that I found online 
says, &quot;If you want to retain copies of your rendered movies that 
you can access outside of the Media Browser or iTunes, see the 
topics about sharing and exporting in iMovie Help.&quot; So you'll 
have to study the iMovie Help to figure out how to save a 
Quicktime movie. Once you have that movie, you should be able to 
use Simple Video Out to play it out to the Canopus an record on tape.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are still following this procedure for the advanced students who edit

</I>&gt;<i> how to get the new imovie to &quot;send out to camera&quot; or &quot;print to video&quot; as we
</I>&gt;<i> do in Final Cut. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are a lot of choices under the new iLife'08 menu (apple TV, web
</I>&gt;<i> streaming), but don't include anything as old-fashioned as camera or
</I>&gt;<i> videotape. Even more confusing is that the tutorial explains how to send the
</I>&gt;<i> finished product to iTunes. Why would I want it there? Can that help me?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought someone out there may understand:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. how can I get an iMovie'08 project out to a Canopus box and VCR?
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Why would I export a video product to iTunes? Will that step help it get
</I>&gt;<i> to the Canopus/VCR?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While there may be an answer, down the road, to change our hardware set-up
</I>&gt;<i> to share work on a web server or something, that is not something that can
</I>&gt;<i> be done today. Hope someone can help with my immediate problem.
