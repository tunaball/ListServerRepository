<PRE>It is unfortunate that Apple decided to replace iMovie 06 with a much  
more 'consumer friendly' version in iMovie 08. Unfortunately by doing  
so, they have deprived a lot of users of the almost professional  
touches that can be achieved in iMovie 06 with its editing options and  
the ability to use some of the great plug-ins from GeeThree.

(<A HREF="http://www.geethree.com/slick/index.html">http://www.geethree.com/slick/index.html</A>)

The ability to play a completed project back to the camera tape for  
storage while also having the original footage on another tape for  
future re-editing, is also a much more cost effective alternative to  
buying extra hard drive space all the time.

I am also glad that this has not just been my opinion. I recently  
asked two groups to edit their projects using both iMovie 06 and then  
08. When I asked for thier opinions 96% of all participants chose 06.  
(4% were absent.)
