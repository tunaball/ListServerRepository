<PRE>Hi Don

What you are taking about requires a mixture of techniques
Obviously there is video editing required as the shots have to be  
compiled somewhere using software like Final Cut, Premiere ect.
There are also a few other programs feeding into the final shots that  
the Editor will compile.

The image that does the 'popping' will be sourced either from existing  
film footage, a still photograph or created in a 2D or 3D package, it  
can be any or a mix of these sources and others.

The image/footage needs to be put into a Compositing application, in  
which it can be moved around in virtual 3D to suit the footage it is  
going to composited with.

As you are talking about the camera moving and the composited element  
matching its movement that has to be worked out as well.
This is done with a technique called Match Moving. Match Moving can be  
found in standalone apps as well as in 3D and Compositing Software.
Essentially it watches the background footage and follows points  
within it, and uses those to work out where the camera was, and how it  
moved. Then it is able to Composite in or to give the Compositing  
program that information to allow the inserted element to 'merge' into  
the scene.
Often in programs about the making of 'Big Budget' movies you will see  
computer controlled or tracked cameras, these are used to generate the  
match move data for compositing in Post Production.

Finally the inserted element needs to be lit in virtual 3D to fit in  
with the lighting in the original footage.
This is a major function of Compositing programs.

Then the composited shot is edited into the rest of the footage.

A quick note as to Apple's Motion as it has been mentioned. It is a  
Motion Graphics program not a Compositing Program
That said there is a very large overlap between the two as Motion  
Graphics programs also need to composite and Motion is a very capable  
program.
Also Compositing programs have a need to use motion graphics, thus the  
overlap.
However take note as each has strengths in its area that the other  
does not and each should be used to its strengths.

Hope this helps

Alex

Hi Listers - I'm sure we have all seen documentary slide shows wherein  
an image in the foreground seems to pop out from the background.  Then  
as the viewing angle moves around, the image appears to be 3D.  Can  
anyone share with me how this is done? Is it software or technique?

Thank you,
