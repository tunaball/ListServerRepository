<PRE>Actually I saw most of the recipients at a convention I attended about 
2 weeks ago and most thanked me personally for the disks and made 
comments on the content.  I feel fairly certain that all the disks 
worked on set-top players.  Just for the record our set-top player is a 
Sony DVP-NS415 which has played a large variety brands that I have 
burned.  I really only had one bad batch of disks of 4 or 5 Ritek 
disks, I have purchased 150 of that brand and was very satisfied with 
them.  The strange thing was that it happened at the same time that I 
purchased LaCie drive so my suspicions were directed to the drive but 
it must have been those disks.  I have since burned that brand without 
further problem but I am still puzzled that all the duds were together 
on the spindle rather than spread more equally throughout the disks.  I 
purchased 25 of the Sony 8 x media while they were on sale packaged 5 
to a package and from my experience till now would be willing to 
recommend the 8x Sony brand.
