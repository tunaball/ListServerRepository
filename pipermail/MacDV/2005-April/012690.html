<PRE>I guessed right. That file you've found with the odd undecipherable 
file name isn't what EyeTV intends for you to use. But since you're 
having trouble exporting, then I don't blame you for trying. I was 
never able to do anything more with it than open it with VLC, but from 
there you're really stuck.

I can't imagine why the export menu isn't greyed out unless you haven't 
highlighted the program entry in the EyeTV Program window. When you hit 
record, the program puts an entry in the Program window that you can 
get info on, edit, delete and export. It's not exactly intuitive, but 
you have to highlight the entry to be able to export it.

If you're doing that, report back and describe what the program tells 
you from the &quot;Show Info&quot;. Are you able to edit it?

I can't recall anything complicated about installing the program. 
Perhaps you've moved the EyeTV's Archive document folder where it can't 
find it? In any event it wouldn't hurt to delete the whole thing, 
including the prefs and start over.

Good luck.
