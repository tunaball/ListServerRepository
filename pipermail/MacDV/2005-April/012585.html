<PRE>The dual 2.5 GHz model is like butter when using Final Cut Pro.  I'm 
currently working on a video project that is similar to one I undertook 
three years ago.  It's nothing that special, but it is illustrative of 
how far we've come.  Back then, I used a 867 MHz G4, single processor, 
with After Effects and Premiere.  It was my first experience with DV 
cameras and Firewire and it was a nightmare.  After Effects was okay 
but the Premiere software was not robust (lots of crashing) and 
rendering times were measured in hours.  Today, with the current state 
of hardware and software, I am able to breeze through this project with 
no surprises.  Rendering time is measured in minutes.  FCP is easily 
able to accomplish what it took the two Adobe products to do back then. 
  No question, you want all the horsepower you can afford ...plus big 
hard drives and lots of RAM.  Life is a whole lot more fun now.

I'm planning, probably sometime this summer, to buy a Dual G5, mainly 
to do video work (importing video from ConvertX/Canopus ADVC 110 into 
iMovie/EyeTV)

There is a fairly steep price difference ($900) between the Dual 1.8 
and the 2.5.

As far as I can see, this is mainly due to the processor speed and the 
bus speed.

Looking at this review
<A HREF="http://www.macworld.com/2004/09/reviews/secondg5/index.php">http://www.macworld.com/2004/09/reviews/secondg5/index.php</A>

It looks like the 2.5 is significantly better than the 1.8 or 2.0 
models.  The 1.8 model comes with an 80gb hard drive which is no longer 
large in this day &amp; age, and 256 RAM, which is absurd.

I'm wondering if others who have worked with the Dual G5s can comment 
on their performance.  You know what they say about benchmarks ;-)
