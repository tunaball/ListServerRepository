Well,

That kind of defeats the purpose of doing online research doesn't it?. Additionally, how do you know which lot of DVD's you are getting between purchases? Even brand names switch where they get their discs manufactured. So, I buy a test lot, they work fine. I buy a spindle and they may not work. So much for testing in-store.

So, yes, it's better to burn at 4-6x than 1x, but it's not what I *PAID* for.

Anyway, I'm not looking to get into a pissing match here. I was just wondering who was getting wide compatibility with 8x burned media and what media they were using.

So far only two people have chimed in with answers:

Gerhard got some 8x Sony DVD-R's to work for him on his set-top player and has received no complaints (however, some people will not speak up out of embarrassment that they think they have poor equipment).

Norm has had good luck using &quot;Prodisc&quot; 4X, (only has a 4x burner).

Anybody else have good, wide, compatibility with 8x DVD-R blanks? What brand are you using?
