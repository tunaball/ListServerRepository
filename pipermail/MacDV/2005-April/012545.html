<PRE>Hi all,

As I mentioned in my email to the list yesterday I began doing a testrun 
build of my 2+Hrs footage DVD. The final burn is supposed to be done to a 
dual layer disc but I don't have my LaCie burner yet so I'm cramming it 
onto a single layer build so I can at least test the flow of the disc and 
make sure it all works as it should - especially the 4:3 to 16:9 
changeover.

I started the build last night at 8ish and it went through to 25% complete 
pretty quickly but it then sat on 31% until we went to bed near midnight. 
To my surprise, this morning at 7am or so it was sitting on 36%. My wife 
called me from home not too long ago (12noon) and it was at 38% so it's 
still moving but inordinately slow.

I have the encoding settings up as high as they can go - double pass, 
&quot;Best&quot; for fast motion etc. and I'm on a 17&quot; AlBook 1.0GHz.

Does that about seem right for encoding speed on such settings on such a 
size project?

Should I expect to lose about 2 days if I'm going to do projects of this 
size using those settings on such a Mac? Or is it much slower than it 
should be because I'm trying to cram it all onto a smaller size disc and 
it's having to work much harder to crunch it down?

I could have reduced the quality settings for this test burn but I was 
also interested in seeing what kind of a job DVDSPro was going to do with 
2+hrs of footage to a single layer disc.

Ta muchly,

Cojcolds
