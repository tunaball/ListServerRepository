<PRE>I would definitely recommend to borrow a second camera.  Leave the 
first one on the tripod aimed at center stage, for example, while you 
move around filming the fun stuff with the second camera.  Right before 
the handing out of diplomas, possibly move it to either the left or 
right side of the stage, so you catch the front of the graduates as 
they walk across the stage, shake hands, get diploma, smile, etc..  
Make sure you leave a trustworthy person guarding that first camera, so 
someone doesn't bump into it.

In the same way that motion picture DVDs nowadays have tons of extras 
added to the disk along with the actual movie, possibly you could 
create two movies.  One would be the &quot;real&quot; one, the edited one.  Then, 
you could also have the &quot;boring&quot; one, which would be the stationary 
camera on the tripod, so people can fast-forward to the few seconds 
where they were getting their diploma.

Regarding the lighting, attend the rehearsal so you can practice 
filming, find out which direction the graduates will be walking, and 
get an accurate idea of the lighting.  Possibly attend another 
graduation first, or another event in the same building, and use that 
one as your practice.

Another more complicated and more expensive idea:  For an additional 
fee, you could personalize the videos, adding that graduate's 10 
seconds of glory into the video.  Of course, you would definitely have 
to make that worth your time, especially if you are having to author 
each one.

Our high school graduation was filmed last year by someone that charged 
more for a less quality product.  In fact, he billed the organization 
an additional $400 for additional hours.  I think this guy was just 
getting into the field.  This year we are working with someone with a 
proven record, and his fees are less.

Just some thoughts,
Claire
