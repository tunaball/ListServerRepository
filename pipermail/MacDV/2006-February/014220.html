<PRE>Hi Don,

Thanks for the tip... I clean forgot to look up the KB. Unfortunately it 
produced nothing but a mention of DVDSPro 3.0.1 fixing the muxing error 
with MPEG-1 video files.

While I still don't know what my issue was I was able to get around it by 
re-encoding all of my video again, which was rather time-consuming and 
painful to say the least!

After fixing that I strangely started to get a similar muxing error when 
it was building one of my slideshows. After trying a few tests and drying 
my eyes I finally rebooted and the error seemed to go away. Perhaps a 
reboot may have been all it needed with the previous error also.

I think I'll look up a good DVDSPro list and get some dialog going there. 
There don't seem to be many DVDSpro users in here.

I'm now having troubles fitting my content on the DL disc. I'm getting 
conflicting reports on how big my project is within DVDSPro (8.9GB in main 
window and 8.5GB in build report) and my completed build folder on the 
hard drive is showing 7.9GB but it still warned me that I was 35.1MB over 
the limit (soo.. near... yet... so... faaar). After dropping the encoding 
on one of my video files that error finally went away but I was then faced 
with it not being able to find a suitable marker to make the layer change. 
Out came the tissue box again as I decided to drop the encoding a bit on 
all video files and try again overnight... I made a successful build this 
morning and I think it was at 7.5GB and I was finally able to format a 
disc image but didn't see what the final size was before I left for work.

I thought I had 8.3GB to play with on a DL disc. Does the DVDSpro 
&quot;formatting to disc&quot; add that much more to it, that my 7.9GB &quot;build&quot; still 
wouldn't fit onto the disc?

Cheers,

Coj

No idea, sorry.  Did you try the Apple Knowledge Base?
