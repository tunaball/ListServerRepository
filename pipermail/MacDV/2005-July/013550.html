I've got a TV screen in the bottom corner of my computer screen.

Before that I'd use the laptop in the TV room.

I was in the hollers of Appalachia 10 years ago (this is a very  
rural, very poor area of the USA), and people who were living in  
houses with no indoor plumbing had those huge satellite dishes.

When we asked about it to some folks who worked and lived there, they  
said &quot;It's all they have.&quot;

Which is to say that I would not expect that the &quot;underclass&quot; will  
stop watching TV.


I used to think there was nothing worth watching on TV either until  
we got TiVo.  I haven't seen a commercial for a couple years (and  
although TiVo is going to try to target ads, there's still a 30- 
second skip button.  It's one thing to flash a message before your  
eyes while you fast-forward... but skipping entirely is quite different.

You have to pay an annual fee per TV in your house.  When my sister  
lived there she said it was the first bill they received when they  
moved in.


The idea that people are going to just stop watching TV is great.  If  
that's your decision, great, but thinking that it's going to be a  
huge trend is rather laughable.
