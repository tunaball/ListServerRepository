Reply 1: My you are an optimist :-)

Reply 2: Oh hell no. The whole reason this is happening is that the  
gov't wants to be able to sell that air space:

&quot;Uncle Sam is eager for the transition - going so far as to set up a  
DTV promotional website - since they stand to make an estimated 30-70  
billion dollars off the resale of the spectrum. That spectrum is  
freely loaned to broadcasters, and would be re-used for high-speed  
wireless voice and data services.&quot;

No secret at all, the government wants the &quot;free&quot; airwaves back so  
they can sell them.

It'll be interesting what, if any, problems this causes with  
regulations (what you can/can't say/show on TV) now that the airwaves  
are no longer &quot;free&quot; ...  Part of the ability of the gov't to control  
what is said/shown has been based on the fact that these are &quot;public  
airwaves entrusted to the networks&quot; which will no longer be true (if  
I understand the future situation correctly, which I may not)..
