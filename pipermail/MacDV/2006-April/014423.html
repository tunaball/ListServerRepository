You can't extract video from any camera through the Mac's USB port. 

That's what the firewire port is for.

Unfortunately, the whole digi-cam industry is moving to the DVD Cam model and that is the worst direction they could go for home editors. The DVD format is a highly compressed format that you first must uncompress to edit and then compress back again to write back to DVD. This deteriorates quality. (And isn't this ashame as the whole 'digital revolution' was to eliminate going from analog to digital back to digital again - which caused a loss of quality. The more things change the more they stay the same.)

Can your Mac read and play the DVD's that your camera is generating? If so, you should be able to use MPEG StreamClip to convert the files on the DVD to DV files so that you can edit them in iMovie. (Note: MPEG StreamClip is free, however you will need to purchase Apple's QuickTime MPEG2 Component for $20).

Another way to get the video from your DVD camera to your computer is to play the video on your camera through an Analog to Digital converter like the Canopus ADVC-110. However this adds some expense and just creates an extra step.

Lastly, the best way to edit movies from a DigiCam is to get a camera that writes to DV tape. The compression is much less, the image will stay unaltered until writing to final DVD.

If you are so inclined, you may want to think about Ebay'ing that sony dvd403 and purchasing a DV Camcorder from Sony or others. It may cost you more now, but the time you save later may be worth it.

Good luck,
