<PRE>George: Sorry to jump in here so late, but here goes.

Two things that have been mentioned in earlier posts on this thread were
correct (more or less). For a turntable cartridge, you typically need a
special phono pre-amp which both amplifies the signal and does a de-emphasis
RIAA equalization (someone posted a very good link to Wikipedia on this).

That being said, your particular turntable has a built-in pre-amp which
takes care of both of these issues. Furthermore, it has a built-in
analog-to-digital converter, which is what comes down the USB cable. My
guess would be that the quality of the converter built into the turntable is
of higher quality than the Mac's built-in analalog-to-digital converter, but
you might want to do a comparison test to confirm this - ya never know.

I was just about to give you a list of steps to go through, when I decided
to do a Google on your setup and found the software manual online. The
detailed instructions for audio setup (Mac) start on page 15. I'm reading
from your most current post (below) that you've got Audacity to recognize
the USB input, but you might want to double check the settings in your Mac's
&quot;Audio MIDI Setup&quot;.

I just downloaded Audacity and tried it out ... I see what you mean ... Sort
of arcane dialog boxes, and the thing crashed on me while trying to figure
out how to save!!

It sounds like you have GarageBand already installed. If you can get past
having it find the instrument folder (these are not really needed if you
just want to record into GarageBand), then under the Track menu select new
track and create a &quot;Real Instrument&quot; track. On the bottom right hand corner
of the Track Info panel you'll see the input settings. Check to see if your
USB Audio driver shows up there. If not, quit GarageBand (and any other open
apps), go to your System/Sound preferences and see if you can get your USB
Audio driver to be recognized there, then open up GarageBand and repeat
above steps. If it's recognized there, you shouldn't have a problem using
any Mac software with the USB turntable output. If not, then:

Worse case scenario, you could get a cable/adaptors from Radio Shack or the
equivalent. You'll need a stereo 1/8&quot; phone plug ---&gt; 2 split female RCA
jacks, or you could use a stereo 1/8&quot; phone plug ---&gt; 2 split male RCA plugs
and a couple of female-female RCA coupler adaptors if the other one is hard
to find. Then plug your turntable analog outputs directly into the line
input on your computer and use the &quot;Built-in&quot; inputs in your Sound
Preferences panel. This would also work with any Mac audio apps.

&gt;<i>From what I've heard, Bias Peak has probably got the most elaborate tools
</I>for cleaning up vinyl recordings, at least at the consumer price level.
Sounds like CD Spin Doctor (comes with Toast) also has some vinyl clean up
tools. I guess it depends on how detailed you want to go with it.

Keep us posted on your progress!
