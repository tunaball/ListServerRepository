I'm going to ask what might be a very stupid question, have you tried 
hooking the turntable up to a Stereo Receiver and seeing what you 
get?  Is there a switch on the turntable to switch between the 
internal phono pre-amp, and using an external one?

&gt;<i>I guess I have to go back and struggle with Audacity music software

</I>
Do any instructions on configuring Audacity for the audio inputs come 
with it?  You have a tricky problem there.  Trust me, interfacing 
audio interfaces and audio software on the Mac can be tricky (I've no 
idea how hard it is on Windows).

&gt;&gt;<i>I have a Audio-Technica LP2D-USB turntable. Mac OS 10.4.1 Power PC

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>turntable. But I find Audacity cryptic in trying to use it. Anybody 
</I>&gt;<i>know if you
</I>&gt;<i>have to save a blank space before trying to bring in the signal? How?
</I>
I have no experience with the audio software in recent versions of 
Toast, I'm running V6 so am not much better off than you. :^)  The 
only reason I'm running that new of a version is because I had to 
upgrade 4 years ago when I purchased this system.  I'm quite honestly 
leery of the software with Toast, as I believe it is based on the 
software that comes with Easy-CD Creator.

I highly recommend Bias Peak, I'm currently using the LE version as I 
had both Bias Peak 2.1 and Bias Peak Express 3.3, and was able to 
upgrade to LE from Express during a special deal dirt cheap.  If 
you'll be doing a lot of editing and need to use multiple plug-ins at 
once, the full version is worth the money, as you can only load one 
plug-in at a time in the LE version.  The question is, will you be 
able to interface it via the USB connection?  Is there something that 
allows the USB connection to be made available via Core Audio?

Zane
