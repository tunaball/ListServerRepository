There's actually two parts to the name of this list &quot;Mac&quot; and &quot;DV&quot;.  If you
want to try to burn DVDs with a Beige G3, that qualifies as being on-topic.
&quot;Mac&quot; (G3) and &quot;DV&quot; (digital video on a DVD).

For Chris:

I have a crusty old Beige G3 running Panther just fine, but I have problems
burning DVDs under OS X.  I can burn fine under OS 9 using Toast Ti 5.2.3,
but no dice under OS X using Toast Ti 5.x or 6.x.  So, maybe this is kind of
a warning to not get your hopes up for burning under OS X. (I tried with
both Pioneer DVR-108 and 107 models.)

Your best bet for burning DVDs would be to get a cheapo VIA chipset FireWire
card on eBay and a FireWire burner -- I have a FireWire case on the way for
my DVR-108, so I'll post an update on compatibility when I get that going.
I think the problem on the Beige G3 is the ATA bus the optical drive is on
-- it's just not very good -- it's super-old ATA/IDE technology.  :-\  So
the FireWire solution should negate those problems.

And for display cards, hit eBay for a Radeon 7000 PCI model.  People sell
the PC versions flashed for the Mac and they work fine.  That's what I got
in mine -- and I use an Apple DVI to video adapter for viewing my desktop on
a TV, which works in both OS X and OS 9, *and* I have a 19&quot; monitor
connected to the Radeon's VGA port.  :-)  (at least get a &quot;dual-head&quot; card
with DVI and VGA connections)

OWC would be a good/cheap source for RAM for the old beast, but that's
probably it...

Hope that helps.

- Mark
