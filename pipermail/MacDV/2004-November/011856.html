<PRE>I am a proud owner of a Beige G3/300 Minitower. Bought it brand new and 
it has been my workhorse for years. I do professional audio with it and 
run such applications as Cubase, Logic, and Pro Tools. I bought a new 
G4 last year but kept the G3 set up right next to me at another 
workstation. Why? Because I run the G3 strictly in OS9 for audio apps. 
I still love OS9 and it's fast. I run Panther on the G4.

That being said, I was doing a bit of net shopping 2 weeks ago and 
decided to upgrade the G3 from OWC. I bought a G4 upgrade ZIF card 
(G4/500) and also a Radeon 9200 video card (128 video memory). The 
Radeon card allowed me to do something I NEVER thought I could do with 
my G3 - connect a 22&quot; Apple Cinematic Display. It is gorgeous. Plus I 
run a second 19&quot; flat panel next to it and have the capability to run 
yet a third screen if I wanted. It's great for showing a full 24 track 
mixing board onscreen.

The G4 upgrade ZIF really made a difference too. It is fast and snappy.

I maxed out the memory, installed an 80 gig hard drive, and a 52x CDRW 
a while back. I also put in a Firewire/USB PCI card and now run a 
triple DVD duplicator off of the firewire port. The DVD burner that 
Toast recognizes in OS9 is the Pioneer A07 - the bottom burner in the 
duplicator stack.

I love my G3. I do have Jaguar 10.2.8 installed on another partition of 
the drive but I rarely boot into it. I love having a workstation in OS9 
next to me. But I'm sure I could do some movie editing in Jaguar if I 
wanted to. I just prefer to do that on my G4 instead (which also has a 
23&quot; Apple Cinematic HD Display and 19&quot; flat panel attached).

You can love and utilize your G3 for years to come. It's a workhorse 
and underestimated. The audio and video jacks in the back were removed 
the following year when the B&amp;W G3s came out and I much prefer the 
Beige even though it is not as stylish.

Yours is a 233 Minitower so you would benefit even more from the G4/500 
upgrade card than I did.

Good luck and enjoy your new baby!

KathyMac!
