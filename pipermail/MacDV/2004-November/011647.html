<PRE>I cannot stop...
I don't think anyone is surprised by a cristian winning an election. I 
assume that most americans are christians, my issue is with anyone who 
puts their religious doctrine before that of the rule of law etc...
&gt;<i> It amazes me that so many people do not believe there could possibly 
</I>&gt;<i> be a majority of conservatives in the USA.  It's as if the liberals 
</I>&gt;<i> think it's a fluke, bought, or rigged if a conservative, Christian 
</I>&gt;<i> candidate actually wins an election.  You have to remember that the 
</I>&gt;<i> first ones to relocate to this continent came for religious freedom, 
</I>&gt;<i> not FROM religion, but FOR the right to worship freely.
</I>I expect the right to worship freely as well. My religion says Abortion 
is ok... but you're not gonna go along with that right?
&gt;<i>   (Go back and read the history books before they began being 
</I>&gt;<i> altered.)  As time went on, more came for freedom in general as well 
</I>&gt;<i> as for opportunity.  Hollywood with its news media is NOT the 
</I>&gt;<i> indicator or the voice of the general consensus of the average 
</I>&gt;<i> American.  It appears to some of &quot;us&quot; that those who want a handout 
</I>&gt;<i> usually vote Democrat and those who want to protect their hard-earned 
</I>&gt;<i> investments usually vote Republican.  Speak hatefully against ANY 
</I>&gt;<i> OTHER group, and you might find yourself being sued by that group.  
</I>&gt;<i> But it's always open season on the Christians.
</I>It's only open season on intolerant Christians...
I would suggest you go read some books as well... like some early 
versions of the bible, I think you'll find it refreshingly tolerant, 
unlike the current version which has been endlessly revised and 
manipulated
&gt;<i> Fire away, because they probably won't shoot back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This MacDV list seems to be made up of reasonable and professional 
</I>&gt;<i> people.  Let's get off of this thread and return to our common ground.
