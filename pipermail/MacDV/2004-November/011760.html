<PRE>
One day, making tracks
In the prairie of Prax,
Came a North-Going Zax
And a South-Going Zax.

And it happened that both of them came to a place
Where they bumped.  There they stood.
Foot to foot.  Face to face.

&quot;Look here, now!&quot; the North-Going Zax said, &quot;I say!
You are blocking my path.  You are right in my way.
I'm a North-Going Zax and I always go north.
Get out of my way, now, and let me go forth!&quot;

&quot;Who's in whose way?&quot; snapped the South-Going Zax.
&quot;I always go south, making south-going tracks.
So you're in MY way!  And I ask you to move
And let me go south in my south-going groove.&quot;

Then the North-Going Zax puffed his chest up with pride.
&quot;I never,&quot; he said, &quot;take a step to one side.
And I'll prove to you that I won't change my ways
If I have to keep standing here fifty-nine days!&quot;

&quot;And I'll prove to YOU,&quot; yelled the South-Going Zax,
&quot;That I can stand here in the prairie of Prax
For fifty-nine years!  For I live by a rule
That I learned as a boy back in South-Going School.
Never budge!  That's my rule.  Never budge in the least!
Not an inch to the west!  Not an inch to the east!
I'll stay here, not budging!  I can and I will
If it makes you and me and the whole world stand still!&quot;

Well...
Of course the world didn't stand still.  The world grew.
In a couple of years, the new highway came through
And they built it right over those two stubborn Zax
And left them there, standing un-budge in their tracks.
