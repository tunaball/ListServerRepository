<PRE>I was thinking the same thing...  But even though the Republican party has
historically appealed to the religious right, what is so morally appealing
about waging a war based on LIES?  The only connection I can see is that the
people who are on the religious right have the same narrow-minded low
tolerance for differing opinions (religious, moral, or otherwise) that they
want to make every one in the world as &quot;morally correct&quot; as themselves by
imposing their own beliefs on them whether they like it or not.  And that's
no way to run a government...

More political &quot;fun&quot;:

(definitions from Webster)
-------------------------------------------------
republic 

\Re*pub&quot;lic\ (r?-p?b&quot;l?k), n. [F. r['e]publique, L. respublica commonwealth;
res a thing, an affair + publicus, publica, public. See Real, a., and
Public.] 1. Common weal. [Obs.] --B. Jonson.

 2. A state in which the sovereign power resides in the whole body of the
people, and is exercised by representatives elected by them; a commonwealth.
Cf. Democracy, 2.

 Note: In some ancient states called republics the sovereign power was
exercised by an hereditary aristocracy or a privileged few, constituting a
government now distinctively called an aristocracy. In some there was a
division of authority between an aristocracy and the whole body of the
people except slaves. No existing republic recognizes an exclusive privilege
of any class to govern, or tolerates the institution of slavery.
-------------------------------------------------
(are we getting back to the &quot;old&quot; version of the word as it applies to the
&quot;Republican&quot; party -- being the priveleged few?)

-------------------------------------------------
democracy 

\De*moc&quot;ra*cy\, n.; pl. Democracies. [F. d['e]mocratie, fr. Gr. dhmokrati`a;
dh^mos the people + kratei^n to be strong, to rule, kra`tos strength.] 1.
Government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is
retained and directly exercised by the people.

 2. Government by popular representation; a form of government in which the
supreme power is retained by the people, but is indirectly exercised through
a system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed; a
constitutional representative government; a republic.
