Whatever they're willing to pay! This will be based on a number of things
such as the producer's financial status (ie have they had some success
before or is this their first film and everything's coming out of their own
pocket?), what the supply/demand curve for video editors and video editing
equipment is in your locale, and of course, your expertise and
educational/work experience.

I can tell you that a freelance video editor friend of mine in Vancouver
charges out at between $35-50/hour (no equipment) and he is currently
working two shifts right now as he transitions from one project to another,
he has no &gt;current&lt; shortage of work. &gt;BUT&lt;, he has 25 + years of experience
working on everything from corporate/industrial videos to documentaries,
specialty channel series', and now reality-based series' (ie broadcast TV).

On the other end of the scale, I've recently seen ads on mandy.com (will
include the URL at bottom) in Ontario for video editors WITH their own
editing equipment willing to work on independent films for free.

If you have little or no experience you'll probably end up having to work
for free (or maybe per diem costs, barter, etc.) on your first couple of
independent projects just to get experience and build some sort of
credibility - something to put on your demo reel.

If you need to actually make a &quot;living&quot; at it, you'd be better to target the
wedding/corporate/industrial markets to start. Perhaps look at taking an
assistant position at one of the local video post-production houses so you
can gain some experience and insight as well as some kind of a paycheque.

Check out this link:
