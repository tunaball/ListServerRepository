<PRE>DVD Burning, players, disc types:

I have access to 2 different iMac OSX 10.3.6. 1 has a pioneer burner, 
the other a sony. I have found that if 1 doesn't work, sometimes the 
other will. When I say works I mean copying a DVD. I have also found 
that some DVD's DON&quot;T burn at all in either computer, either in toast 
or iDVD. I have so many coasters I could set up a shop. I have found 
that LGDVD-R 1-4x always work, I have used about 30 of them.
Laser brand vary. I have trouble with the silver, but the white or 
shiny surface seem to be alright  most of the time. I tend to try these 
as they come out cheaply sometimes ( $1 ). LG are $2 a pop in Adelaide.
I also have had trouble playing anything I make on either computer in 
some DVD players. However the cheapest of all DVD players LG Model: 
DV7711P so far plays everything and anything. An LG combo Home Theatre 
System plays only sometimes, and certainly will not play slide shows 
made in iPhoto 4.0.3, imovie, and iDVD !!!  They are the same brand and 
about the same age, but so so different !! Pioneer DVD players are 
always good for me, they haven't shown an error with anything I have 
made so far !!!
I too have had trouble with the crashing before burning, but not with 
the brands I have discussed. All that time, all that effort and nothing 
!!! Another thing too is pixellating - some discs seem to give me that 
problem, but when I put one of my faithful LG's in no worries !!
Hope this helps someone, I do know how frustrating it all is. I have a 
friend who gave me this address and he has helped me no end, he is a 
real gem, we all need someone like him. Cheers Merelyn
