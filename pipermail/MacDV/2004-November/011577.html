<PRE>
It has been a long time since I have seen him post.  He was always
quick to answer and optimistic that updating your software to the
latest available would solve every problem.  I thought he was a pretty
good guy but he did polarize people, other members either liked or
disliked him with very little neutral ground.  I think after the news
article with his bio was posted he was never quite the same and then
there were a few flame attacks directed towards him that seemed
undeserved.
Maybe he is finally editing all the video footage he has taken over
years and no-longer has time to follow this group.

Thanks for that Gerhard and thanks to others for their responses.    My 
sentiments exactly!

Providing you were aware that Kunga kept his ear to the grapevine and 
that you did not take everything he reported as gospel then you could 
quite often glean  useful information.    After all, where there is 
smoke there is quite often fire.   He got me out of a few problems with 
his contributions  and I  still remain amazed at some of the vitriol he 
was subjected to.

It would be nice to be a fly on the wall and see how he attacks all 
that material he has put into storage over the years (a bit like me 
with all my Digital Photography,  iCreate and  Macformat magazines and 
various Manuals I have amassed in the past 4 years).

Best wishes ,
Ian T.
