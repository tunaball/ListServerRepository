Despite the verbal attacks and put downs by both sides, for me this 
election goes beyond Bush and Kerry.  A famous writer named, Dante 
said,  &quot;The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who in time of 
crisis remain neutral.&quot;   And according to , Edmund Burke, &quot;For evil to 
triumph, it is only necessary for good men to do nothing.&quot;  Therefore, 
this election, I will vote for the &quot;issue&quot; that matters most -- the 
right to life for the unborn -- those who are most vulnerable and are 
not able to speak for themselves.

Many people have told me this election is about &quot;the wrong war&quot; and 
about jobs and health care, taxes, etc.  Yes, those issues are 
important -- they affect most people and me.  But, I submit that if, as 
a country, we continue to support a law that makes it &quot;legal&quot; to kill 
over 4,000 babies a day (that's per day) for the sake of convenience, 
our country as we know it will suffer collapse from its own selfish 
bent.   History shows that when a civilization resorts to killing its 
young, it is doomed to defeat and/or extinction.  We have become a 
nation that idolizes the pursuit of pleasure and avoiding pain at all 
costs -- of blaming the other guy and not taking responsibility for our 
own actions -- of turning a blind eye when called on to stand up to 
speak out against unjust behavior.  It's time to begin reversing this 
trend.  I want my grand children to grow up in a society that protects 
their right to think critically and protects the rights of the less 
fortunate.

Putting all politics and spin aside, we have two choices in this 
election -- to vote for life or to continue to support the legal 
destruction of life.  I choose to protect the unborn by voting for 
life.  The issues of war, jobs, health care, social security and taxes 
don't even matter if you don't have life to experience them.  This is 
where I put my stake in the ground when I'm called to account for my 
voting decision.  I hope you will find some wisdom in this and vote 
your conscience on November 2nd.
