<PRE>My apologies to the list but I cannot let this pass. Especially in 
light of the way the election seems to be going.

I not only find this post annoying but offensive as well. You espouse a 
society based on critical thinking and compassion, yet you fail to hold 
yourself to either. Not to mention the (I assume) religious 
affiliations you hold has been the touchstone for the slaughter of 
millions and the doctrine by which countless cultures and civilizations 
have been eradicated.

The practice of &quot;killing ones young&quot; is certainly not unique to this 
country, and has been practiced for ages when too many females were 
born to &quot;peasant&quot; families whom could not support another. Because for 
most of the world (unlike europe and NA) the government does not 
support the poor. Women need dowries and hence become burdens. The 
logic being it is better to kill one than for all of them to starve or 
suffer.

Perhaps if we did make this election about jobs and health care and 
taxes, we would have the time to develop a more compassionate nature as 
a culture. If you would poke your head out of your shell for a moment 
and look at the marvelous array of culture and belief systems that 
exist somewhere outside of your gated community, perhaps you too would 
see that abortion is the least of our worries.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Putting all politics and spin aside, we have two choices in this 
</I>&gt;<i> election -- to vote for life or to continue to support the legal 
</I>&gt;<i> destruction of life.  I choose to protect the unborn by voting for 
</I>&gt;<i> life.  The issues of war, jobs, health care, social security and taxes 
</I>&gt;<i> don't even matter if you don't have life to experience them.  This is 
</I>&gt;<i> where I put my stake in the ground when I'm called to account for my 
</I>&gt;<i> voting decision.  I hope you will find some wisdom in this and vote 
</I>&gt;<i> your conscience on November 2nd.
