<PRE>I'm breaking my LONG reply into two parts so the list server doesn't 
bounce it again (10K limit? sheesh!)

--- Part 1 ---

I outlined the steps in a previous thread on how to successfully go 
from iPhoto to iMovie for output to tape or as a DVD video file (not a 
DVD slideshow which is different):

Frank, a couple of notes about your situation:

- when you're working in iMovie the video does not look very good on 
your computer, but if you hook up a FireWire camcorder to your 
computer, and the video from the camcorder to a TV/video monitor, it 
will look GREAT.  iMovie intentionally only shows a &quot;low-res&quot; version 
of the clip so it can use it's processor time to let you edit faster.  
The same is true when viewing a DV clip in QuickTime Player -- but if 
you open the movie properties (cmd-J) in QuickTime Player (Pro) you can 
enable the &quot;High Quality&quot; option for the Video track -- it may be 
choppy when it plays back, but the image will be sharp (this does not 
affect the actual video file, just how QuickTime Player displays it).

- if you only have a few photos, just bringing them into iMovie will be 
the easiest way to make a video &quot;slideshow&quot; for output to video tape or 
DVD, but if you have *A LOT* of photos, exporting a slide show from 
iPhoto then converting it to edit in iMovie will probably be easier in 
the end (as long as you have enough drive space).

Note:  to do the edits described below, you will need to upgrade to 
QuickTime &quot;Pro&quot; if you have not done so already.

- - - - - - - - - - - - -

Here's how to go from an iPhoto slideshow to iMovie (for output to 
video):

1.  Export the QT slideshow from iPhoto WITHOUT audio at 640x480
2.  Open the slideshow .mov file in QuickTime player (you will need the 
&quot;Pro&quot; version to do these steps)
3.  Open the audio track you wish to add in QuickTime player also
4.  Copy the audio track and &quot;Add&quot; (under &quot;Edit -&gt; Add&quot; in the menu bar)
5.  Trim the movie at the last black frame (shortening the slideshow 
and cutting the music - read below for alternate method)
6.  Export from QuickTime Player (Pro) to a QuickTime Movie using the 
DV codec at 29.97 fps (NTSC) at a custom size of 720x480 with audio as 
16 bit 48k stereo (no compressor)
7.  Add *THAT* to iDVD and see how it works. (should work great)
(this is for NTSC output -- for PAL, adjust settings accordingly)

Notes:

- *DO NOT* initially convert the slideshow from iPhoto to &quot;DV Stream&quot; 
format from QuickTime Player (Pro) -- this doesn't render the 
transitions properly for some reason when exporting, but using the 
&quot;QuickTime Movie&quot; format with the DV codec works fine, and you can open 
those files with no problems in FCP or Premiere, but... (read next note)

- if you want to export this to tape through *iMovie*, you will need to 
convert it (yet AGAIN) to a DV Stream file (ugh) -- but you can delete 
the QuickTime &quot;interim&quot; DV-codec file afterwards if desired (it will 
not recompress the DV information, so no quality will be lost during 
this conversion)

- if you want the slideshow to *fit* the music, you should add the 
video to the audio (rather than audio to video as listed above), and 
when doing this, choose &quot;Add Scaled&quot; when adding the slideshow video to 
the audio track -- keep in mind that this will lengthen or shorten the 
duration of the images and transitions to fit the music, but it should 
not pose a problem technically

- when originally exporting from iPhoto, use a 4:3 frame size like 
640x480 or 720x540, so that it will stay proportional and provide 
sufficient file size for final export to 720x480 (this final output 
will look distorted on-screen but look fine when output to video -- 
this is normal for DV-format clips)

Got all that?  Test tomorrow!  (hehe)  ;-)
