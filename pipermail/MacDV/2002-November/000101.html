Better specs that a high-end CRT? Just asking as I totally agree with
your decision.

&gt;<i> The single most important thing you can do for Final Cut
</I>&gt;<i> is to buy the Contour Shuttle Pro.
</I>
I've heard mixed reviews of the Shuttle Pro. Personally I'm thinking
of getting a FCP optimized keyboard for use with my TiG4 PB. The
Shuttle would definitely be more portable, though.

&gt;<i> However, it is absolutely crucial that you have an NTSC monitor

&gt;<i> all the time in FCP editing. It is the ONLY way to grade color if
</I>using
&gt;<i> color correction, and the better the monitor, the better off your
</I>&gt;<i> results.
</I>
Yep, right on the money.

&gt;<i> I use a Sony Broadcast Monitor normally with SMPTE C Phosphors.
</I>&gt;<i> This allows setting to bars, and doing &quot;standardized&quot; color
</I>correction.

I would have gone with the Sony but my budget was already blown, so I
ended up with a re-furb JVC TM-910SU instead. I haven't done a
side-by-side comparison but the JVC has done the job for me both in
the field &amp; in the studio editing.

&gt;<i> If you look at DVCAM footage from a PD150 on such a monitor and a
</I>Beta
&gt;<i> SP or DigiBeta on another monitor of the same ilk, the similarities
</I>so
&gt;<i> outweigh the differences that when &quot;going home,&quot; they could be
</I>&gt;<i> interchangeable. We have. No one noticed. Brave New World..
</I>
I've gota lot of experience with BetaSP &amp; DVCPRO &amp; totally agree.

&gt;<i> For cutting, short of color correction, using even just using the
</I>TiBook
&gt;<i> for FCP is fine. Newer generation ADS Pyro Drives (the ones that
</I>DON'T
&gt;<i> look like their industrial design comes from 1961) work perfectly
</I>for
&gt;<i> DVCAM/DV streaming relative to FCP editing.
</I>
Do you capture straight to your FW drive? I recently got an OWC Elite
FW drive, but haven't used it for a FCP project yet (soon, *very*
soon! ;-). I've heard of problems capturing to the FW drive, but
nothing spacific, just recomendations to capture to the internal
drive, then copy it to the external. Also, are you using a deck or the
Pd150 to feed to TiG4 PG?

Take care,

Frank Wiewandt
