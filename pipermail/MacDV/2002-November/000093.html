</I>Well that's a damn shame. I reply because I did a similar thing. I 
bought a Sony TRV9 out of the display case at the wiz.
It was clear that they didn't want to sell it to me as the guy took the 
battery off it and told me it didn't come with it.
He wouldn't even look for any of the accesories and so I bought just the 
bare camcorder and a battery.
Luckily for me Sony sold me pretty much the whole kit. PS, book remote.
I use that sucker EVERY day. It is my personal Camera and my DV deck. It 
is my back up. Very handy.
Sony Sony Sony.
