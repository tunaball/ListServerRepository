</I>&gt;<i> differences, or even errors, in resampling digital audio be apparent to
</I>&gt;<i> the layman? Even with a great home theater? Probably not. We have
</I>&gt;<i> resampled a ton of 44 KHz audio from music libraries to 48KHZ, gone to
</I>&gt;<i> DVD as well as VHS with them, and nary a soul has ever complained. Audio
</I>&gt;<i> purists, on the other hand, rip out their hair over this. So do the
</I>&gt;<i> music library producers, who often swear by their 44.1 KHz CDR delivery.
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, based on the continued acceptance of declining quality of
</I>&gt;<i> the broadcast medium (note the &quot;100% Digital Quality&quot; remarks on Direct
</I>&gt;<i> TV commercials and then look at the artifacts within their highly
</I>&gt;<i> compressed signal) it will remain true that content, not technology,
</I>&gt;<i> rules in the end. When we score a project, we just use 48Khz for
</I>&gt;<i> everything: music recording, ADR, foley, etc. because we are primarily
</I>&gt;<i> headed toward DVD release with independent stuff, even industrial
</I>&gt;<i> video.  Keeping things simple is easy to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As to audio solutions in production:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the problems with all Sony camcorders, from the PD150 on down, is
</I>&gt;<i> that none are really regarded highly for their audio, meaning doing good
</I>&gt;<i> ol' double system sound - separate video and audio, is a solution.
</I>&gt;<i> Drifting from sync is not the problem it used to be when shooting film
</I>&gt;<i> in the early days of digital audio. Things have worked out nicely since
</I>&gt;<i> that time, and in DVCAM/DV,
</I>&gt;<i> syncing DAT audio, for example, works quite well, even when not
</I>&gt;<i> resolving the two devices to the same reference. &quot;Wild&quot; audio is much
</I>&gt;<i> less so in the age of digital everything. Just get a film style slate
</I>&gt;<i> with clapper, maybe even a timecode version - it helps in editing later
</I>&gt;<i> on, anyway. Double system also means you can have complete control over
</I>&gt;<i> the audio portion of a show. It requires good working habits, but the
</I>&gt;<i> end result can be a richer sonic experience during both the edit and the
</I>&gt;<i> audio mix.

Yes, I'll be using a double system for interiors.
Various mics with a UA 2-610 to a Akai DR4d or
my PC.
For the time being I'm using the VX2k for exteriors,
but I'm seriously considering getting a Minidisc for
exteriors, and for collecting outside Foley FX sounds.  -doug
