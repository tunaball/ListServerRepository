<PRE>Just seconding the contour shuttle pro remarks.  It rocks!
I zip through stuff with it. Both hands are busy.
And obviously if I was doing something *important*,which I don't, I 
would turn on the video monitor.
On the otherhand not using the outboard monitor gives you the realtime 
dissolves.
I shoot with a VX1000 and a trv900 and have Lacie electronBlueIII 19 
 and crappy panasonic monitors.
Oh and a quicksilver 867.

Really!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is absolutely crucial that you have an NTSC monitor online 
</I>&gt;<i> all the time in FCP editing. It is the ONLY way to grade color if 
</I>&gt;<i> using color correction, and the better the monitor, the better off 
</I>&gt;<i> your results. I use a Sony Broadcast Monitor normally with SMPTE C 
</I>&gt;<i> Phosphors. This allows setting to bars, and doing &quot;standardized&quot; color

</I>&gt;<i> the similarities so outweigh the differences that when &quot;going home,&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> they could be interchangeable. We have. No one noticed. Brave New World..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For cutting, short of color correction, using even just using the 
</I>&gt;<i> TiBook for FCP is fine. Newer generation ADS Pyro Drives (the ones 
</I>&gt;<i> that DON'T look like their industrial design comes from 1961) work 
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly for DVCAM/DV streaming relative to FCP editing. We had eight 
</I>&gt;<i> video and eight audio tracks without a hiccup. Remember to mixdown 
</I>&gt;<i> your audio on complex edits, however. Trying to play back more than 8 
</I>&gt;<i> tracks of 48 KHz is demanding on FireWire.
