<PRE>Hi Folks,
    I have been following a couple of threads about problems finding the 
iTunes library from iPhoto, and finding iTunes and iPhoto Libraries 
from iMovie3 and iDVD3.  I believe that I have simplified and condensed 
the assorted posted solutions.

There is a plist (preferences file) named com.apple.iApps.plist.  This 
appears to be where iPhoto finds the location of the iTunes library, 
and iDVD and iMovie find the location of the iTunes and iPhoto 
libraries.  This file may or may not exist, and it may or may not 
contain correct information.

The simplest solution I have found to create a correct 
com.apple.iApps.plist is as follows

1) If they are running, quit iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto and iTunes
2) Start iTunes
3) exit iTunes
  - at this point, you should have a correct &quot;iTunesRecentDatabases&quot; 
entry in com.apple.iTunes.plist
4) Start iPhoto
5) click on Slideshow
(at this point you should be able to see your itunes library) if not, 
remove com.apple.iApps.plist from your home-&gt;Library-&gt;Preferences 
folder and start over at step 1.
6) click on &quot;save settings&quot;
  - At this point you should also have a correct &quot;iPhotoRecentDatabases&quot; 
entry in com.apple.iTunes.plist

I have also been using iPhoto Library Manager and iPhoto Librarian.  
These two applications allow you to have more than one iPhoto Library.  
At the current time, neither of these applications modifies 
com.apple.iApps.plist.  This means that if you follow the process 
above, then change your current library with one of these two 
applications, then launch iMovie or iDVD, they will still be 
referencing your previous iPhoto Library.  You can get around this by 
following steps 4 through 6 above, each time you change your iPhoto 
library.

   Another note on these two tools: The advantage of iPhoto Library 
Manager is that it keeps a local copy of the com.apple.iPhoto.plist in 
each library.  This means that each library can have its own copy of 
preferences, keywords, etc.  Changes to preferences for one library do 
not affect the others.  The advantage of iPhoto Librarian is that it 
modifies the main copy of com.apple.iPhoto.plist and does not make 
copies of it.  This means that all iPhoto Libraries share the same set 
of preferences, and changes made to preferences, keywords, etc in one 
library affect all of the others.

Another note for the brave: you can edit these plists manually in your 
favorite text editor, or with /Developers/Applications/Property List 
Editor.


Cheers,
     Drew
