Which part of what I said is &quot;not exactly correct&quot;? Please point that 
out to me.

I am fully aware that there are 2 types of recorder, as I'm the one 
that pointed that out. I'm also the one that pointed out the flag on 
the Audio CDR.

You state that &quot;Apart from that, there is no major difference between 
these licensed CDs and their unlicensed counterparts.&quot; However the 
original poster didn't say that there wasn't any MAJOR difference, he 
said:

&gt;&gt;<i> There is no difference between music and data CD-Rs. It's just a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packaging gimmick to charge more.
</I>
which is 100% incorrect as I pointed out and you obviously agree with. 
So again, tell me where what I said was &quot;not exactly correct&quot;

Incidentally, Music CDRs will work fine in computers despite your 
erroneous claims to the contrary. Data CDRs will not work in the vast 
majority of Standalone Audio CDR decks, however music CDRs will work 
fine in computers. The issue of course is why spend more for a disc if 
you don't have to.

Next time you feel the need to &quot;correct&quot; someone, please ensure that 
they actually are in need of correcting.
