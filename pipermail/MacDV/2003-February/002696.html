David I appreciate and believe all that.  But I have no illusions about 
being a talented graphic designer. I am a half-assed graphic designer. 
What I am is a First-Rate Technician and Sofware/Hardwarre wrangler, who 
has learned some graphic design to enhance my work.  Certainly over the 
course of time I have learned quite a bit of both things, and delved 
quite deeply into 3D animation too, (perhaps my true love) enough to 
make an effective program, sometimes even enough to get excited about, 
but as much as I enjoy video and editing it is more driven by my love of 
the technology than the end product that I think I can produce. 
Ultimately that is my edge.
But nuts and bolts and dollars and cents says that a dual procressor 
with FCExpress and an unmarried renter with no one to answer to can 
offer the same work for less than my FCP and single processor w/ wife 
child and mortgage.
Even at the same price I have to give away rendering time already. It's 
a constant calculation against someone's nephew.

Jim
