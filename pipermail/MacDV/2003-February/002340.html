<PRE>    Well,  If says Memorex, I wouldn't touch it with a 20 foot pole....This is based on
my experience with their so-called &quot;Top of the line&quot; VHS and audio cassette tapes...I
have in excess of 500 videotapes going back about 15 years and the only ones that have
consistently been troublesome have been Memorex ones.  I also have an extensive cassette
collection and the same thing there.  The Memorex tapes were bought in their multi packs
at different times and from different merchants around the state of PA and I have had to
return almost all of them due to problems such as jamming or tearing the very first time
that the tape was inserted in my Sharp Video camera or Montgomery Ward VHS
recorder/player , along with 2 different model Panasonic, 1 Hitachi, 1 Sylvania, 2 Sharp
VHS units.   If the tape did make it through the initial recording session,  there was
always noticeable degradation after only a few hours of playback. The audio cassettes
fared a bit better, but the magnetic coating wore off after only a few hours of
recording /playback of favorite albums.
    I have since sworn off anything to do with any products bearing the Memorex name.  I
always contacted the Memorex customer service office and invariably got the excuse that
&quot;  We had a temporary glitch&quot;  or I was the first or only person to notify them of a
problem and it was probably my equipment rather than their tapes that were the problem.
It was funny that after removing the Memorex and using any other brand I had no troubles
at all.  My equipment is meticulously maintained so I am able to rule out equipment
failure.
    So take it for what it's worth.. If there are consistent problems with the VHS
and/or audio tape lines it doesn't bode well for their CD/DVD product line either.
     I got the Philips desk top DVD recorder...model DVDR985 at Circuit City for
Christmas ...Now it is a DVD+ system and I have burned over 15 Verbatim DVD+ discs since
12/26/02 and haven't had a coaster yet.  The DVD+ discs all play in my iMac SE 400,
Pismo w/ LG DVD drive, and an Apex  model 703 table top DVD player unit.
    I am now a firm believer that you get what you pay for..
Regards,
Mike K
