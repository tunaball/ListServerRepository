&gt;<i>Will the TRV-900 do video pass through?  
</I>No, unless you use the &quot;hack&quot; that some people have talked about.  I do not know how to do it though.
&gt;<i>I checked the Sony web site at that time, and it clearly said that the TRV-900 
</I>&gt;<i>would do pass through.
</I>I remember a salesperson, either on the website or at a Retailer, saying that it was an error on the sony website.  Some retailers also used Sony's website information which further confused a lot of people.  If I am incorrect in what I have just shared,
please provide us with an update.  Any Sony people on the list?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My guess is that Sony added the pass through feature at some point, 
</I>&gt;<i>without changing the model number.  So older TRV-900 models can't do 
</I>&gt;<i>pass through, but those manufactured shortly before the TRV-950 came 
</I>&gt;<i>out can do pass through.  I haven't done it, but that's the info that 
</I>&gt;<i>I have found.
</I>Interesting... I purchased a TRV 900 just a few weeks before the 950 came out.  It was backordered from Sony Canada (made in Japan) and the manufactured date was February 2002, and no pass-through. I did a lot of research on both models and discovered
that there were more drawbacks to using the 950 than using the 900.  Such as the new lens that was used, and a few other items that I cannot seem to remember at this time.  But anyway, several people that I contacted (&quot;professional&quot; camcorder reviewers)
all agreed that the 900 was the &quot;better&quot; camera than the 950.  The pass-through capability was a consideration for me, so I also picked up a a very inexpensive D8TRV730 to do pass-through (also used as a &quot;VCR&quot;) for my work (which also meant I could still
use 8mm and Hi8 tapes with my students).
