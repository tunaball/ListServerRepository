Truly puzzling.  I got a report this morning from a friend at work who 
uses iMovie exclusively (I'm more of an FCP type of guy).  I emailed 
him Friday as soon as I found the download and he downloaded it 
immediately (main draw: Ken Burns and the audio track).  After a 
weekend of horror stories I was expecting the worst.  He loves it.  A 
few things to get used to, but it worked well for him.  I didn't have 
any problems over the weekend -- but like I said I use FCP3 more than 
iMovie, so I'm not a good judge on this.  I questioned him on every 
issue raised over the past few days -- he didn't encounter ANY of the 
problems.  Puzzling, indeed.  We both have original issue iMac 15&quot; Flat 
Panels, with SuperDrive.

BTW, I love iDVD.  The themes are wonderful (even though some themes 
only differ in terms of color).  I must get the rest of my videos 
converted to DV and edit more stuff to do a really cool DVD with 
chapters and a cool theme.  I'm quite happy with iLife.

Randy
