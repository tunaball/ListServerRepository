<PRE>I want all you authors out there to know that I have 2 iMovie books, a 
QuickTime 5 book, 4 FCP books, a Premiere 6 book and the FCP Manuals 
1-3 and not one of them has the word &quot;Demux&quot; or &quot;demux&quot; in their index.

Why Erica Sudan? Why Gene Steinberg? Why Tony Reveaux? Why Lisa 
Brenneis? Why Jason Cranford Teague? Why David Teague? Why Tom Wolsky? 
Why Judith Stern? Why Robert Lettieri? Why Antony Bolante? Why all the 
rest of you authors? Why have you ALL ignored the need for a section on 
the process and variables involved in demuxing video and audio into 
separate files to be recombined in the final edit?

You throw that word out like it's the word &quot;chocolate&quot; and I don't 
appreciate me having to ask such stupid questions about something that 
is so easily explained by Steve Rogers in a few posts and NOWHERE in 
any of these tens of thousands of pages. I believe that this is a 
subject that has been grossly overlooked by all of you. Shame on all of 
you! (sarcasm) ; ^ )

Would you please add this topic &quot;demux&quot; to what you are currently 
writing and add the word to the index?

And will any of you who have written pages about demuxing please come 
forward and claim credit for it so I can run out and buy your book 
immediately please?

Thank you all for paying attention to this rant and scrambling to call 
your editors to stop the presses to add this section immediately. This 
is an outrage!! ; ^ )

Love yall,

k

Rumor has it that you can import the MPEG straight into
iMovie by drag &amp; drop. Make sure to demux the video though
to recover your audio.

Haven't tried it myself yet
