No rumors or half-truths, straight from the horse's mouth (from the 
agreement displayed during the install of the Mac version of the 
player):


REALNETWORKS, INC.

6.                 AUTOMATIC COMMUNICATIONS FEATURES. 

 

a)                    The Software consists of interactive Internet 
applications that perform a variety of communications over the Internet 
as part of their normal operation.  A number of communications features 
are automatic and are enabled by default. By installing and/or using 
the Software, you consent to the Software&#146;s communications features.
Once you log into the Software, user information including your 
user id will be sent in communications with RN&#146;s servers. This information 
is used to access your regular account, premium content, non-premium 
content, services, features, and other personalized services. RN 
may match the user id to personally identifiable information in order 
to provide you with products, services, and software that you&#146;re 
entitled to and to provide you with relevant information. You are 
responsible for any telecommunications or other connectivity charges 
incurred through use of the Software.

 

b)                   Cookies: The Software also allows the use of 
cookies, similar to an Internet browser.  This allows any website 
to set cookies for you when you view any of the website&#146;s content 
through the Software, unless you have disabled cookies. If you have 
disabled cookies, you may be asked to login each time you access 
premium software features and services and some RealOne services 
may not function properly. To learn more, visit the RealNetworks 
Privacy Policy link on our website at <A HREF="http://www.realnetworks.com/company/privacy/index.">http://www.realnetworks.com/company/privacy/index.</A>
html. 

 

c)                    AutoUpdate: The RealOne Player, using AutoUpdate,
automatically communicates with RN's servers on the Internet to 
check for updates to RN&#146;s and RN partner&#146;s software, such as bug 
fixes, patches, enhanced functions, missing plug-ins and new versions.
AutoUpdate also has the capability to run independently of RealOne 
Player to perform background update checks. RN may download updates 
during the background checks, when RealOne Player automatically communicates 
with RN&#146;s servers, when you manually check for updates, or when RealOne 
Player detects a file it does not support. AutoUpdate sends information 
about installed RealNetworks&#146; products and components to the servers 
to determine upgrade availability. If you prefer to be notified when 
an auto-update is performed, follow these steps: On the Tools menu,
select Preferences, AutoUpdate, and then de-select &#147;Automatically 
download and install software updates.&#148; However, as we describe above,
certain updates to RealOne Player functionality will happen automatically 
and without advance notification. 

 

d)                   Message Center: The RealOne Player software,
using Message Center, automatically communicates with RN&#146;s servers 
to check for new important messages, including software updates and 
service bulletins.  Message Center can also run independently of 
RealOne Player to perform background new message checks. Message 
Center sends information about installed RealNetworks&#146; products and 
components to the servers to allow receipt of suitable product update 
and other messages. Message Center is set by default to show message 
headlines and to check for messages once or twice a week. You can 
change the way messages are displayed and the frequency messages 
are checked by following these steps: On the View menu, select &#145;Message 
Center&#146;; The Messaging Center dialog appears; On Options, select 
&#145;Delivery Preferences&#146; and select the desired preferences. If you 
sign up for services that send messages more often than the frequency 
you have selected, your frequency selection may be adjusted. The 
first time you use RealOne Player, you will be sent a Welcome Message 
that will enable you to opt-out of receiving Special Offers messages 
and opt-in to receive other personalized messages, depending on your 
categories of interest. Receipt of upgrade information is not optional.
