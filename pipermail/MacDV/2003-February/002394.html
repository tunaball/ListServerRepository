<PRE>Geno,
When you play a video, does the scratch bar location triangle with the 
time code on it roll smoothly with all the frame count displaying like 
iMovie 2 did? Mine stutters across although the movie is playing fine, 
that triangle with time code jumps several seconds at a time instead of 
flowing across frame by frame with all the numbers flying by in iMovie 
2. Let's start with this quirk that I think a lot of us are getting. Is 
your's smooth or jerky?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mike,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You are 100% on target.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This new iMovie 3 is an abomination and an exercise in futility if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to just get your work done. After finishing this morning's school
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> announcements (a 7:00 am job that I can get done in peace before the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kids - middle school, pour in) I tried  iMovie 3 out. Thankfully the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> finished tape was already in hand as we laboriously tried to grind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through some simple editing using a G4 dual 500 with a gig of memory.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I bailed out after wasting 30 minutes, rebooted into 9.2, went back to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iMovie 2.11 and was able to finally load up the file, clean up the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crud
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from version 3. As far as I am concerned, that's the way my machine 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stay too. Life is too short to throw away time trying to nursemaid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apple's folly into a working product.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While I hope that Apple never quits supporting the old working 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that allows simple people like me to finish their work efficiently, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think the writing is already on the wall. I'd rather switch to a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows system that just works than put up up with this foolishness 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apple.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I really wanted to like iMovie 3, but I'm having enough trouble with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it I think I'm going back to 2.1. I'm hoping that by posting my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> experience some of the experts on the list may be able to help me 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> out.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The system I'm using is a dual 1 GHz Quicksilver with 1.5 GB RAM
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> running OS 10.2.3. For video in I'm using a Sony Digital Media
</I>&gt;<i> Convertor.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Launching iMovie 3 takes much longer, but I think that's related to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the last edited project. So if I open a project that was created in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> iMovie 2, it seems to take forever. Opening projects made in iMovie 3
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> takes less time, but even opening a &quot;blank&quot; project seems to take
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> longer than iMovie 2.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Importing video seems to work fine, except when I switch from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> importing to editing, then back to importing, I get the no camera
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> message. I have to quit iMovie and restart to get it back (this works
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> every time).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I guess the other thing to mention is that during the import I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sometimes get a wide black band either on the left of the view or on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the top and bottom. This had me really worried, but when I go back to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> look at the clips after capturing them, the bands are gone. I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wondering if the display is messed up because I resized the window 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it has to take a few shortcuts to display in real time.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The user interface seems very slow. I click on a clip and it will 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> take
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a second (literally) for it to show in the viewer window, then 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> another
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> second for the &quot;scrubber&quot; triangle to appear. I'm actually over there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with the mouse pointer waiting for it to appear. OTOH, the non-UI
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stuff seems to be just as fast if not faster. If I push the right
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> arrow on the keyboard to view a clip in iMovie 2, I can watch each
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> frame go by, In iMovie 3, it seems to scroll by faster than real 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Can anyone explain the clip selection logic? Seems like if I move a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> clip, or sometimes just click on it once, it does not become the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> selected clip. I have to click on it a second time.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So I've done a bit of editing and its time to export to QuickTime.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Because of some problems with iMovie 2 coming to a halt if in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> background, I've gotten in the habit of exporting to &quot;Full Quality 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> DV&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then using Quicktime Pro to do the conversions. The good news is that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this is now unnecessary because iMovie 3 will continue at full speed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> even when in the background. The bad news is that when I export to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Full Quality DV my audio ends up out of sync. That's never happened
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> before. I was hoping to use this method to get to VCD until Roxio 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> gets
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their plug-in updated.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Some other things I've noticed with exporting:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you Export to QuickTime and use &quot;Expert&quot; you get the same dialog
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> box you get when exporting using QuickTime Player and QuickTime Pro.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You even get the same progress bar, which means you don't get an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> estimated time to completion.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> When I finally hit the &quot;Export&quot; button and get the file dialog to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tell
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it where to export to, more funny things happen. First, I want to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> change the default name of the output file, but I can't select just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the part before the &quot;dot&quot;. I either get the whole file name or just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fhe dot and what's after. I can however use the arrow and delete keys
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to accomplish the task or just type in the whole name.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> When I try to navigate to a different drive to save the file, part of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the file listing pops up outside the dialog box. With a few repeated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> attempts I can get what I want if I ignore the &quot;ghost&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Three times now I've had exports that didn't work. There is no error
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> message and no file created other than  a 4 kB .mov file in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> project folder. I haven't figure out what happened in these cases, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I did notice that the export did not take as long as it should have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (twice I was exporting to mp4, once to full quality DV).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My plan for now, since I installed iMovie3 using the System Update
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> method, is to go on a seek and destroy mission to get rid of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> everything iMovie related, then do a &quot;clean&quot; iMovie 3 install. If 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't clear some things up its back to iMovie2.
