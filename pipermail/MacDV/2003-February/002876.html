Wrong. Where did I state that the Audio Discs would work *only* in a 
Stand Alone recorder? I said nothing of the sort.

Here is my original post:

&quot;Music or Audio CDRs are watermarked and contain a flag that tells the 
standalone player that these are certified for use in that player. 
Typically, these discs use a better quality dye as well, resulting in 
better burns, especially at high speeds.&quot;

Show me where I state that &quot;Music&quot; CDRs can *only* be used in a 
standalone recorder. Once again, Kunga made a false statement, i 
corrected him. Then you tried to claim that what I said was &quot;not 
exactly correct&quot; when in fact it was entirely correct.

In fact, *YOU* made an erroneous statement when you claimed:

&gt;<i> The concept of
</I>&gt;<i> this licensing system never really took off as it became perfectly 
</I>&gt;<i> possible
</I>&gt;<i> to burn CDs for personal use using a standard CD-R in any computer, 
</I>&gt;<i> which

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;licensed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> discs, which won't work.)
</I>
Which is incorrect as I pointed out already. Computer CD-R/Ws will use 
a &quot;licensed&quot; CDR just fine, contrary to your incorrect assumption.

That's 3 times now you've claimed I said something I didn't, I'd 
suggest you read things a little more carefully from this point forward.

&gt;<i> Here in the UK, where we didn't sign up for the Athens agreement that
</I>&gt;<i> promoted the so-called consumer CD-R system using licence-paid discs
</I>
Wonderful. However that means exactly squat to people living in the 
U.S, which is the majority of this list.

And incidentally, ALL CDRs marked as &quot;Music&quot; here in the U.S. are of 
the licensed variety. I am in the U.S. and so is Kunga, so what I said 
applies. In your zeal to
