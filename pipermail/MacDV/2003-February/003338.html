Seriously I think your steps are no solution try a reinstall.  I have a 
800 iMac with superdrive and have had some audio issues with iMovie 3, 
after updating to 10.2.4, that seems to be fixed (touch wood) and iDVD 
3 has successfully burned several l disks for me.  I found that with a 
project made in iDVD 2 the buttons in the menu were screwed up but were 
easily repaired. Generally my experience with iLife has been positive.
