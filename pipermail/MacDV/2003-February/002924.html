<PRE>&gt;<i> All Right,

</I>&gt;<i> Please knock it off, or take your cat fight off line!
</I>
I sent exactly one previous message on the originating thread, which 
picked up on a statement made by Ric. I said (in part), &quot;I've heard the 
same from many places, but it just doesn't make sense to me&quot;, and 
stated why it didn't make sense to me. He wrote a polite response 
explaining why it did make sense and yesterday I sent an off-list 
thank-you to Ric for his explanation, since it obviously took a bit of 
time for him to write it.

IMO that's exactly the type of exchange lists like this are for. I 
didn't understand something, he explained, I sent a thank-you note.

Messages like the one above, however, accomplish nothing positive, just 
more off-topic posts. If I may be a bit presumptuous here, if anyone is 
having a problem with the type of post someone is sending to an email 
list, its much better to email them directly, off-list prior to 
singling them out on-list. There's simply too much room for misreading 
people due to the variety of backgrounds and language abilities 
represented on the list, which by its very nature is an imperfect 
communications medium to start with.

My apologies to the list for this off-topic reply, but after debating 
with myself for a while, I decided to go ahead and send this to the 
list (yeah, I know, I'm not following my own advice). However, this 
will be my only post on this subject, any further correspondence will 
be off-list.

-Mike
