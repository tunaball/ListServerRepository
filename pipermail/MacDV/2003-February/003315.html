<PRE>When I originally read the terms of use for FreePlay's music, I got a 
different impression than I have been reading here. I went back to 
their website and checked and found that their usage policy isn't as 
obvious as you might think.

As was said, they do grant rights for personal non-commercial use but 
in addition, they also grant free commercial use for programming and 
even advertising if the resulting product is to be broadcast or 
transmitted on TV, internet, or...well let me just quote them.

&quot;Freeplay Music, Inc.'s musical compositions and recordings may be 
broadcast and/or copied for the purpose of being included in any 
programming or advertising being produced for transmission over any 
medium (including television, satellite, wireless or internet media) 
worldwide. Freeplay music may also be synchronized in programming for 
the purpose of retail videotape or DVD distribution, if such 
distribution follows broadcast or transmission of the synchronized 
Freeplay music in the programming over television, satellite, wireless 
or Internet media. These rights are also granted for personal, 
non-commercial uses. These reproduction rights (known as mechanical, 
synchronization and master recording rights) are absolutely FREE, and 
are granted in perpetuity.&quot;

Anyway, we are using some of their music for Public Access cable 
television. The usage rights seem pretty generous for music that can be 
downloaded for nothing. It's true though, if you are looking for music 
for a commercial production only distributed on DVD or videotape, they 
want to sell you a license.
