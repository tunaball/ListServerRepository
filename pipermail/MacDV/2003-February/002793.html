<PRE>Here is a link to a hack to enable the pass-through capability of the Sony
TRV900 video camera.  Although I have not yet tried this hack myself on my
own TRV900 (which I have had for several years and dearly love), the TRV900
video camera apparently does possess the capacity to do analog-to-digital
pass-through (but, as I understand it, this mode is ordinarily not enabled
in the video camera as it comes from the factory):

John Beale has created an astonishingly complete resource archive centered
primarily around the Sony TRV900 video camera but with an excellent
discussion of other digital video cameras and all sorts of other digital
video-related topics.  The site contains an excellent FAQ and some very
useful links.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I checked the Sony web site at that time, and it clearly said that the

</I>&gt;<i> I remember a salesperson, either on the website or at a Retailer, saying that

</I>&gt;<i> I have just shared,
</I>&gt;<i> please provide us with an update.  Any Sony people on the list?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My guess is that Sony added the pass through feature at some point,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without changing the model number.  So older TRV-900 models can't do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pass through, but those manufactured shortly before the TRV-950 came
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out can do pass through.  I haven't done it, but that's the info that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have found.
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting... I purchased a TRV 900 just a few weeks before the 950 came out.
</I>&gt;<i> It was backordered from Sony Canada (made in Japan) and the manufactured date
</I>&gt;<i> was February 2002, and no pass-through. I did a lot of research on both models
</I>&gt;<i> and discovered
</I>&gt;<i> that there were more drawbacks to using the 950 than using the 900.  Such as
</I>&gt;<i> the new lens that was used, and a few other items that I cannot seem to
</I>&gt;<i> remember at this time.  But anyway, several people that I contacted
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;professional&quot; camcorder reviewers)
</I>&gt;<i> all agreed that the 900 was the &quot;better&quot; camera than the 950.  The
</I>&gt;<i> pass-through capability was a consideration for me, so I also picked up a a
</I>&gt;<i> very inexpensive D8TRV730 to do pass-through (also used as a &quot;VCR&quot;) for my
</I>&gt;<i> work (which also meant I could still
</I>&gt;<i> use 8mm and Hi8 tapes with my students).
