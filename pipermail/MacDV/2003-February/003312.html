<PRE>Thesteps which Bill outlined, while they may all been required to get 
to a state where things were working, are somewhat unrelated.  They 
will not be required for each disk you burn, or each project you edit.  
It sounds like some things were amiss on your system, and burning dvds 
in iDvd is a pretty high level task that requires many things to be 
working properly.

Corrupted file and folder permissions does seem to be a fairly 
pervasive problem with Mac OS X.  It can cause any number of strange 
behaviours.  Fortunately, it is easy to fix with repair permissions..

While I have not yet burned with iDvd3, I did have issues with the 
previous version of iDVD (on a previous release of X), if my system was 
set to let the hard drives go to sleep.

I have also had issues with iMovie and iDvd being able to see my itunes 
and iphoto library.   I have discovered a simple solution for this 
which does not require trashing plists or reinstalling software.  I 
will post this under the subject &quot;Solution to Problems finding iTunes 
and iPhoto libraries from within iApps&quot;   I will also address issues 
regarding iPhoto Librarian and iPhoto Library Manager.
