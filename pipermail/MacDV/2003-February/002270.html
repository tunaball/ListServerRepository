<PRE>Hello to all;

I'm a newbie and have been lurking for a month or so, trying to gain a bit
of knowledge.

I too wish to transfer 8mm film (old home movies) into video.

Equipment available - dual USB iBook, 500mhz, 386MB, Jag; elderly analog VHS
camcorder; JVC (mini cassette - not digital) camcorder; and VCR. Haven't got
Toast, but will get it; have iMovie 2; Quicktime 6.1 (not Pro - but will get
also, if needed). Will soon be purchasing an 80 GIG La Cie firewire external
drive for this project.

Wish list includes a digital 8 or miniDV camcorder but not in the immediate
future.... If I can do this with what I've got, I'd be most pleased.

I've found a good reputable company who will clean and transfer the film to
VHS, digital 8, miniDV or DVD - my choice. Leaning towards VHS based on
current equipment, etc. I'll go the digital 8 or miniDV route if I can find
a friend or neighbour with a Digital camcorder that I can borrow...

As few family members have yet embraced DVD's, that format is out. VHS would
be an acceptable format from which to edit and distribute copies to family,
with the long term plan being to convert VHS to digital - most likely
digital 8 or miniDV. Is there a preference out there regarding the choice of
digital 8 and miniDV formats? Pros and cons other than being able to play
older VHS tapes in the digital 8?

Acknowledging the fact that the quality of the home movies is not the
greatest, and that VHS would be good enough quality for the transfer at this
time, does anyone have ideas or pointers as to how best to get the VHS video
into the iBook, so as to edit and transfer back out to VHS?

Can I just hook up the old-fashioned VHS camcorder to the iBook, as one does
to the TV? Are any special cables needed? I believe one of the cables which
came with the computer is to allow it to hookup to the TV. Or does one
record from the TV or VCR, either of which are playing the video??

Sorry for all the questions - it's totally new territory for me, but I know
it can be done with a little help from the experts!

Thanks in advance

Brenda
