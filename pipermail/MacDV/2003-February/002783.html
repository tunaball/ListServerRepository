<PRE>Visited the Art Gallery of Ontario on Friday morning with a group of grade 5 and 6 students.
In one wing, there was an exhibit from a &quot;video artist&quot; (insert your own word/s between the parentheses) where he had set up three 27&quot; t.v. sets &quot;side-by-each&quot;. Underneath each unit were wooden cabinets, which were housing DVD players.  

Anyway, on the first set was a DVD loop of a handheld-camcorder-closeup of the full moon with the sound of a campfire as the soundtrack (2min 45sec in length).  

On the second screen was a DVD loop (1hour 45min) of mosquitoes flying (including the sound of their wings) in front of a screen-door somewhere in the wilderness as the sun was setting.

The 3rd screen displayed a DVD loop (3min 30sec) of a forest scene, with &quot;forest&quot; sounds, where the background was a still picture (not video) of a combination of deciduous and coniferous trees but there was one lone deciduous tree that appeared in the
foreground and was in a time-lapse mode (leaves and branches were moving quickly in the breeze).
Anyone care to share how this effect was achieved. 
(Mask, blue/green screen, picture-in-picture, other ???)

By the way, only 1 of the 25 students thought that these DVD loops were considered &quot;art&quot;.  And this was the student who last year came up with the idea of creating a &quot;claymation&quot; iMovie as a class project.

This got us thinking, if we contacted the right people and sent a copy of our claymation movie to them at the AGO, perhaps we could set up our own &quot;art&quot; for everyone to view.  (it does have the &quot;sculpture&quot; aspect)  Very cool indeed!

By the way, please don't &quot;steal&quot; our idea, or we'll react like Cosmo Kramer from the Seinfeld episode where Calvin Klein &quot;steals&quot; his idea about perfume that smells like the beach. And then maybe we'll have to hire Jackie Childs to file a lawsuit !   ;-)
