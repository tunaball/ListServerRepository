<PRE>Maybe the &quot;new&quot; ADS case I have doesn't have the same functionality of 
the good-ol' ADS cases (mine's from 2002).

</I>&gt;<i> I bought a pair of tin snips at the hardware store. I removed the 
</I>&gt;<i> plastic front panel and pulled the drive and the 5.25&quot; and 3.5&quot; frame 
</I>&gt;<i> it is in after I unplugged the drive's IDE, power and audio connectors 
</I>&gt;<i> of course. Then I used brute force to cut the corners of the part of 
</I>&gt;<i> the front metal frame that was designed for only a 3.5&quot; zip drive. It 
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't easy. I had to use a lot of strength and perseverance to clip 
</I>&gt;<i> those thick metal corners off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Next I used a pair of pliers to bend what metal was left out of the 
</I>&gt;<i> way including the bottom part down and out the front opening (there is 
</I>&gt;<i> no hope of putting the plastic face back on ever again) so there is 
</I>&gt;<i> now a full two 5.25&quot; hole in the front. Inside I had to also use the 
</I>&gt;<i> pliers to flatten the 3.5&quot; stubs left on the bottom that were keeping 
</I>&gt;<i> a 5.25&quot; drive from laying flat on the bottom of the metal shelf.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After getting everything flattened and bent out of the way, I placed 
</I>&gt;<i> the DVD-RAM drive on the bottom (set to Slave) and hooked up one of 
</I>&gt;<i> the two power connectors and the middle IDE cable to it. Then I placed 
</I>&gt;<i> the DVR-105 (set to Master) above it with the other power cable, the 
</I>&gt;<i> end IDE connector and the audio cable (because I plan to play DVDs and 
</I>&gt;<i> CDs from the DVR-105) connected to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's it. Closed the door and fired up the computer. No problem. 
</I>&gt;<i> Everything works like it should. You need 10.2.3 of course since that 
</I>&gt;<i> is the first version of OS X that supports the DVR-105.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I put the PowerLogix G4 ZIF 550 upgrade in there today and it's 
</I>&gt;<i> running just fine at 600 MHz with a 300 MHz 1MB L2 cache. So I'm iLife 
</I>&gt;<i> compliant and ready. Not super fast, not slow either. The G4 only cost 
</I>&gt;<i> me $255 so it was worth it to get Altavec in the old '99 B&amp;W so I can 
</I>&gt;<i> run iDVD 3. Already tested it with a copy of iDVD 2.1 I have and it 
</I>&gt;<i> works just fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's really an aesthetics thing. I don't look at my computers. They 
</I>&gt;<i> live under my tables, not on them. So if you care more about the value 
</I>&gt;<i> of having two drives in there than you do about how cute it looks, 
</I>&gt;<i> this is a no brainer. I plan to copy my DVD-RAM discs over to DVD-R 
</I>&gt;<i> disks and then put a fast 40x12x48 CD-RW drive on the bottom. Then 
</I>&gt;<i> ripping MP3s will be really fast in there. The read speed of the CD 
</I>&gt;<i> drive is the bottleneck of MP3 ripping NOT the processor speed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After I cut the corners off with the tin snips, I returned them back 
</I>&gt;<i> to the hardware store the next day and got a refund.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does that completely answer your question?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had the intention to do the exact thing Jim Soriano mentioned in

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in my G4/500 at work and put the factory DVD-RAM drive in an ADS 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FireWire case.  It didn't work.  I returned the first ADS case 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because I thought it was defective.  When I got the second one and it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *still* didn't work, I called ADS support and they basically said 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;yeah, those don't work with optical drives unless you can flash the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> firmware from a PC&quot;, of which there are none here (at work) with a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FireWire card, and the PCs that we *do* have are highly-used (can't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get access to for something like this anyway).  ADS offered for me to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> send it to them so *they* could flash it, but then I would be stuck 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with it as an optical drive (DVD-RAM) case, so I wouldn't be able to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> install a hard drive later on if I wanted...  So now I have a Pioneer 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DVR-104 installed in my G4/500, an empty ADS FireWire case, and an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> orphaned DVD-RAM &gt; drive...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just a heads-up.  If you get an external case for your DVD-RAM drive, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talk to the *manufacturer* first to make sure it will work for your 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kunga, how'd you &quot;hack&quot; your BW G3 case to support two 5-1/4&quot; optical 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drives?  I remember seeing some case mods for that somewhere on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'net a while back, but I don't have that info any more.
