<PRE>You can buy each family HH a DVD player for $39 each. But transfering 
film to DVD would be among the lowest resolution ways.

Transfer to mini DV. Get two copies each. One for backup. The other for 
use. That is the highest resolution way. It will still be radically 
lower resolution than your original film. You can buy a cheap MiniDV 
camera to use as a deck for $299 on sales now. Just keep studying the 
Sunday inserts.

Forget about VHS any more. The cheapest new or used MiniDV camera will 
record radically better video. You can use the DV camera to transcode 
your original VHS video into the DV format on your iBook. And you can 
record them to the DV format to preserve maximum &quot;quality&quot; of what you 
have in the obsolete and YOU WILL NEVER USE AGAIN VHS format.

OK Brenda. Promise me that. Make buying a cheap DV camera your #1 
priority. Not Digital 8. Horror stories of Digital 8 eating tape.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm a newbie and have been lurking for a month or so, trying to gain a 
</I>&gt;<i> bit of knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I too wish to transfer 8mm film (old home movies) into video.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Equipment available - dual USB iBook, 500mhz, 386MB, Jag; elderly 
</I>&gt;<i> analog VHS camcorder; JVC (mini cassette - not digital) camcorder; and 
</I>&gt;<i> VCR. Haven't got Toast, but will get it; have iMovie 2; Quicktime 6.1 
</I>&gt;<i> (not Pro - but will get also, if needed). Will soon be purchasing an 
</I>&gt;<i> 80 GIG La Cie firewire external
</I>&gt;<i> drive for this project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wish list includes a digital 8 or miniDV camcorder but not in the 
</I>&gt;<i> immediate future.... If I can do this with what I've got, I'd be most 
</I>&gt;<i> pleased. I've found a good reputable company who will clean and 
</I>&gt;<i> transfer the film to VHS, digital 8, miniDV or DVD - my choice. 
</I>&gt;<i> Leaning towards VHS based on current equipment, etc. I'll go the 
</I>&gt;<i> digital 8 or miniDV route if I can find a friend or neighbour with a 
</I>&gt;<i> Digital camcorder that I can borrow...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As few family members have yet embraced DVD's, that format is out. VHS 
</I>&gt;<i> would be an acceptable format from which to edit and distribute copies 
</I>&gt;<i> to family, with the long term plan being to convert VHS to digital - 
</I>&gt;<i> most likely digital 8 or miniDV. Is there a preference out there 
</I>&gt;<i> regarding the choice of digital 8 and miniDV formats? Pros and cons 
</I>&gt;<i> other than being able to play older VHS tapes in the digital 8?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Acknowledging the fact that the quality of the home movies is not the 
</I>&gt;<i> greatest, and that VHS would be good enough quality for the transfer 
</I>&gt;<i> at this time, does anyone have ideas or pointers as to how best to get 
</I>&gt;<i> the VHS video into the iBook, so as to edit and transfer back out to 
</I>&gt;<i> VHS?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can I just hook up the old-fashioned VHS camcorder to the iBook, as 
</I>&gt;<i> one does to the TV? Are any special cables needed? I believe one of 
</I>&gt;<i> the cables which came with the computer is to allow it to hookup to 
</I>&gt;<i> the TV. Or does one record from the TV or VCR, either of which are 
</I>&gt;<i> playing the video??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for all the questions - it's totally new territory for me, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> know it can be done with a little help from the experts!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance
</I>&gt;<i>
