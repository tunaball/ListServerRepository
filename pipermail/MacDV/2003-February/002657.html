<PRE>DVD-RAM is more like a very slow hard drive. You can drag and drop to 
write to it like you do to a hard drive. You can trash files and delete 
them like you do from a hard drive.

I'm not clear about 105 DVD-RW's multi-session capability. I think it's 
more like CD-RW. I just got mine three weeks ago. Haven't gotten into 
it yet. The reason for putting them both in there is so you can 
duplicate DVDs you make or others (not illegally) easily. I don't claim 
to be an expert on all the copy and duplication ways with this drive 
yet.

I'm sure you can make a disk image and copy multiple times with Toast 
5.2. You have that? I think Toast 5.2 is an essential utility for 
writing CD-Rs and DVD-Rs. I realize that Apple has made multi-session 
burning easier with the new Disk Copy features for that 
(File&#8212;&gt;New&#8212;&gt;Blank Image or &quot;Command N&quot;). But Toast is much more 
versatile and you don't have to know how big the image is in advance of 
creating it like you do with Apple's way.

Somebody else care to take this ball please. Anyone spend much time 
rewriting to a Pioneer DVD-RW drive yet?
