<PRE>If you were like me looking to find an iDVD-type of software to run 
on an external DVD drive then don't bother with Formac and their 
Devideon software. 'Cause, if you don't like it or anything about 
their external DVD drive package they will sting you with a 20% 
restocking fee.

I purchased their external Pioneer DVD-105 based drive and software 
and was disappointed in both the software and their external case 
design. No deal on the price either as it was higher than most 
packages at $399 but I thought if their Devideon software measured up 
then it might be worth the extra dollars.

Poor external case design,  their extremely slow response to tech 
support questions, Devideon software that was deadly slow and 
unreliable encoding to MPEG2 showed me, in short order, that this was 
not worth an extra money and I returned it for a refund.

Only after I returned it for a full refund did find out it was not to 
be. Formac has a policy to charge a 20% restocking fee to everything 
returned to them. Even though their Devideon software didn't perform 
as advertised and their external case design was not acceptable. 
IMHO. They refused to lower or even considering renegotiating the 
restocking charge telling me there are - NO exceptions.

I feel the company misrepresented itself when I was not informed at 
purchase (directly from Formac)  of this onerous restocking fee. If I 
had known that, I would have given them a wide berth. I don't like 
companies who try and hold you hostage to bad products with 
outrageous restocking fees.

I ended up buying a bare Pioneer DVD-105 drive and an excellent 
external case from FW Depot.

If you are interested in more detailed specifics of my situation with 
Formac you can email me off the list and I would be happy to send 
them to you.
