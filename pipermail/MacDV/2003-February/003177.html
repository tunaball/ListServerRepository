<PRE>Yes but the art work and music involved with Apple's iDVD 3's templates 
is so outstanding that it will be a hard act to follow. What Mac are 
you trying to get iDVD 3 working on with a SuperDrive for yourself

</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, you can contact www.lacie.com to get more information.  I will

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have never used or seen it.  I have just read about it and talked to
