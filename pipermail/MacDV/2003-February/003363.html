<PRE>&gt;<i> No rumors or half-truths, straight from the horse's mouth (from the
</I>&gt;<i> agreement displayed during the install of the Mac version of the
</I>&gt;<i> player):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Um, did you actually read this before pasting it? It says *exactly* 
what I did -- that it does *not* report on the nature of what you are 
listening to/watching, and that you can turn off any and all reporting 
functions if you want to. Thanks for making my point.

&gt;<i> RN
</I>&gt;<i> may match the user id to personally identifiable information in order
</I>&gt;<i> to provide you with products, services, and software that you&#8217;re
</I>&gt;<i> entitled to and to provide you with relevant information.
</I>
This can very clearly be turned off in the Preferences. It's not 
hidden, it's not difficult. I believe it is off by default, actually 
(can't recall).

&gt;<i> Cookies: The Software also allows the use of
</I>&gt;<i> cookies, similar to an Internet browser.  This allows any website
</I>&gt;<i> to set cookies for you when you view any of the website&#8217;s content
</I>&gt;<i> through the Software, unless you have disabled cookies. If you have
</I>&gt;<i> disabled cookies, you may be asked to login each time you access
</I>&gt;<i> premium software features and services and some RealOne services
</I>&gt;<i> may not function properly.
</I>
As this clearly says (and as I said, and as is again obvious in the 
preferences if you'd just care to have a look), it refers to cookies 
stored for premium access (ie login username/password info). Again, it 
can be turned off and you will never be bothered for it AT ALL unless 
you decide to sign up for Premium content.

&gt;<i>  To learn more, visit the RealNetworks
</I>&gt;<i> Privacy Policy link on our website at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.realnetworks.com/company/privacy/index.">http://www.realnetworks.com/company/privacy/index.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> html.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It should also be pointed out that spyware, by its very nature, doesn't 
actually TELL you what they are going to do and give you the option of 
turning it off, ergo NOTHING in RealOne Player qualifies as &quot;spyware.&quot;

&gt;<i>  AutoUpdate: The RealOne Player, using AutoUpdate,
</I>&gt;<i> automatically communicates with RN's servers on the Internet to
</I>&gt;<i> check for updates to RN&#8217;s and RN partner&#8217;s software, such as bug
</I>&gt;<i> fixes, patches, enhanced functions, missing plug-ins and new versions.
</I>&lt;snip for space&gt;
&gt;<i> If you prefer to be notified when
</I>&gt;<i> an auto-update is performed, follow these steps: On the Tools menu,
</I>&gt;<i> select Preferences, AutoUpdate, and then de-select &#8220;Automatically
</I>&gt;<i> download and install software updates.&#8221;
</I>
1. The Mac version of RealOne Player does not HAVE a Tools menu. Hmmm, 
is it possible that this bit is just copied wholesale from the Windows 
version of the agreement? Nah, it's clearly a vast conspiracy.

2. Autoupdate can be turned completely off by unchecking a very obvious 
box in the preferences.

I don't know if you've noticed, but a huge number of OS X applications 
automatically check on startup for new versions. If this bothers you, 
you may want to consider abandoning computing altogether, or at the 
very least disconnecting from the internet. How you make the leap from 
this to &quot;I'm being watched&quot; is  a complete mystery. Lord only knows 
what sort of thick folder of info Apple must have built up on you by 
now, seeing as how &quot;Software Update&quot; sits there silently, built right 
into the system, always waiting and watching and learning ...

In any event, this section has clearly been copied over from the 
Windows agreement, because on the Mac version of the player this can be 
TURNED OFF ENTIRELY. As can cookies and guid's (yes, COMPLETELY). In 
short, the Mac version of the player can send NO OUTGOING INFORMATION 
WHATSOEVER if that's what you desire. But it's more fun to quote 
obsolete user agreements than it is to (heaven forbid!) actually 
investigate the thing yourself.

&gt;<i> d)                   Message Center: The RealOne Player software,
</I>&gt;<i> using Message Center, automatically communicates with RN&#8217;s servers
</I>&gt;<i> to check for new important messages, including software updates and
</I>&gt;<i> service bulletins.
</I>
More proof that this is copied wholesale from the Windows agreement. 
The Mac version of this software does not HAVE a Message Center.

Again, thanks for making my point. I think your tinfoil hat might need 
some adjusting.

_Chas_

&quot;To use the Mac is to be confronted, over and over, with the idea that 
the most mundane task can be done artfully and compassionately, 
beautifully and invitingly. &quot; -- Glenn McDonald
