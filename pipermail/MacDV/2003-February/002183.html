OS X is certainly not &quot;super bloated&quot;. The OS might not be perfect, but 
I wouldn't call it buggy now.

The main benefit of OS X is that it is basically a well known operating 
system. One of the main reasons Macs didn't catch on in the business 
world is that sys admins didn't like them because they're different. 
Now the Mac is a known quantity - just another unix box. Moving the Mac 
to BeOS would be incredibly stupid because there is effectively zero 
programming community for that OS and zero support for it in schools 
and businesses across the country.
