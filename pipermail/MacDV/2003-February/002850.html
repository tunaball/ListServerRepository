<PRE>I feel that the confusion comes with the fact that there are effectively
three types of CD blanks that are commonly available:

1) Those that are for _domestic_ stand-alone audio CD recorders only. The
only batch of these that I have ever bought would not function in the
SCSI-based CD burner that I was using at the time. This would have been
about four years ago. These are the CDs with the licence-fee applied. You
appear to have had success with these in a computer-based burner, but that
is not my experience. In the UK at least, these CDs are pretty rare.

2) CDs that are specified as being for audio use but do _not_ have the
licence fee applied. These should not work in the stand-alone recorders,
although there were various hacks that were supposed to let you use them.
These will work quite happily as data CDs.

3) CDs that are specified as being for data use. Most of these will work
quite happily as audio CDs and the blanks that we are currently using are
Imation 700 MByte disks that are specified as being for data or audio.

&gt;<i> Which part of what I said is &quot;not exactly correct&quot;? Please point that
</I>&gt;<i> out to me.
</I>
The original post and your reply were as follows:

&gt;&gt;<i> There is no difference between music and data CD-Rs. It's just a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packaging gimmick to charge more.
</I>
&gt;<i>This is absolutely false. If it were true you could just use data CD-Rs
</I>&gt;<i>in a standalone CD recorder and not pay the extra $$ right? Well, you
</I>&gt;<i>can't.
</I>
Well, that depends on what you mean by a stand-alone recorder. Both my
stand-alone recorders - a Marantz and an HHB, work with discs that fall into
categories 2 and 3 above. The Marantz pre-dates the licence-paid CDs and the
HHB works fine with non-licence paid audio and data CDs. Therefore, in my
world at least, what you wrote is not exactly correct.

I stand by what I said about the relative merits of different dye layers.

I trust that this clarifies my statements.
