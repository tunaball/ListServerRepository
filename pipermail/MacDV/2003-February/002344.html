<PRE>Very reluctantly I have decided to revert back to iMovie 2 (v2.1.2) at least
until I can figure out what, if anything, I can do to get iMovie 3 to work
on my system (a Beige G3 upgraded with a Sonnet 500Mhz G4 and 640 MB of RAM
and running Jaguar).

Since I couldn't find any remaining downloads for iMovie 2 on Apple's
website (they appear to all have been replaced by iMovie 3) and because when
I installed iMovie 3 as a part of installing iLife, my old copy of iMovie 2
was de-installed, I used a shareware program called Pacifist (downloadable
from <A HREF="http://www.charlessoft.com">http://www.charlessoft.com</A>) to extract and install iMovie 2 from Disk
#2 of my Jaguar installation CDs.

Although video capture did work OK on my system using iMovie 3, the
following did not: 

1. As has been reported in some other systems, iMovie 3 playback of existing
iMovie project files was very choppy with lots of audio dropouts

2. Unlike what others have reported, on my system, exporting DV back to tape
on my video camera produced severe audio dropouts and missing frames on the
tape (the drive I use for iMovie import, export and processing is a LaCie
80G external firewire drive -- no video was imported to, exported from or
processed on my internal boot drive)

Although I have been reading about other people's experiences with iMovie 3,
I haven't tried using the other features of iMovie 3 because of the extreme
performance problems mentioned above.

What I tried in order to improve iMovie 3 performance:

1. Following Thubten Kunga's suggestion, I downloaded MacJanitor 1.2 and ran
it.  I did not try running Xoptimize 1.0a because the difficulties I was
experiencing with iMovie 3 did not seem to be related to loading and
launching times as far as I can tell.

2. I also tried exporting all of the iMovie 2 project files in one of my
iMovie projects into QuickTime format and then importing them into a new
iMovie 3 project.  The playback performance did not improve.

I will be upgrading my video board to an ATI Radeon 7000 fairly soon to
enhance my ability to play DVDs on my system, but I don't know what to do
regarding iMovie 3.  At this point I, too, am a bit disappointed.
