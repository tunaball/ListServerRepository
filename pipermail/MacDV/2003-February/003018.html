<PRE>It's also at Staples.com for $239 with a $50 mail-in rebate and a $40 
online coupon. That brings the price to $150. Has anyone used this 
drive in an external firewire enclosure?

I'm not interested in doing the internal/external hack, but I'd like a 
Firewire burner. I just want to make sure that this drive will work 
with Toast and OSX burning apps.

No Problem Hal. It will work find that way. Check out the new version 
of the hack that lets you keep you core in the case and only involves 
unscrewing and rescrewing 12 screws.

DVR-105 $149 at Staples.com

I picked up a double male connector and a long Y splitter at Fry's 
today for $3. I'm going to use the double male to just add one of many 
flat IDE cables I have laying around for just 12 inches more or maybe 
the whole 18 inches if it will still work.

The Y Splitter is the kind that daisy chains from the male to a first 
female and then continues on to a second female with a second set of 
lines running out of the first female to the second. So without the 
first female connected it is an 18&quot; single power extension cable.

I couldn't find a round IDE extension cable there like what we've found 
online. I have so many flat ones laying around that I don't see the 
point of going that way if I can get it to work with one of these.

I also bought a new &quot;Cendyne&quot; 16x DVD-ROM, 48x24x48x CD-RW drive at 
Fry's for $70 after $30 rebate. I will test that drive to see if our 
Cubes see it. It's a SAMSUNG model SM-348. I have two cubes. So I want 
to be able to have them both use external burners with your hack. Will 
let you know how it goes.
