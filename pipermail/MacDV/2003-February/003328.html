<PRE>&gt;<i> From: BURTON Chris &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/macdv.html">chris.burton at swift.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Was just curious ... I have a bunch of digital photos and some small 
</I>&gt;<i> video clips that I wanted to create a web site around. What
</I>&gt;<i> webpage design app should I choose?
</I>
Best thing would be the HomePage feature of .Mac. Well worth the money 
you'd pay to join, and you won't find a classier, more elegant or 
impressive way to present your photos and Quicktime movies unless you 
happen to be a whiz with Flash.

&gt;<i>  I'm looking for something somewhat simple and not outrageously priced 
</I>&gt;<i> ... and for OS X. Would
</I>&gt;<i> something like Dreamweaver be the best solution?
</I>
We can't really answer this question until you tell us your level of 
skill with HTML and what you mean by &quot;outrageously priced.&quot;

Since I presume you are looking for a WYSIWYG html editor that allows 
you to put up a relatively basic page with little or no HTML coding, 
here are my suggestions:

CURRENT PRODUCTS:
I think Dreamweaver is WAAAAAY overkill for what you want to do and 
would suggest you look at Freeway (www.softpress.com). Retail is about 
$250 but I suspect you can find it for less. It's probably the best 
&quot;visual&quot; page/site creator that's not &quot;industrial strength.&quot; If you 
have any experience with Quark Xpress or Pagemaker you will almost 
certainly find Freeway's &quot;boxes&quot; metaphor a quick one to pick up. 
Softpress also have some EXCELLENT tutorials on their website so you 
can get a feel for how the program operates before you buy, and I 
believe they may even have a free demo.

You might also want to experiment with Composer, the free HTML 
authoring component of Mozilla 1.3/Netscape 7. It's actually much more 
&quot;visual&quot; than most people think, there are plenty of good tutorials out 
there, and it's FREE.

DISCONTINUED PRODUCTS:
If you look around ebay, you might find copies of Adobe's discontinued 
but highly-regarded PageMill software, or even Apple/Claris' original 
HomePage software (same name but entirely different from the .Mac web 
service). For simple pages/sites these things are really hard to beat. 
It's a pity there aren't more products like them still being made for 
consumers who want to do simple sites but don't want to spend more 
than, say, $50 or so.
