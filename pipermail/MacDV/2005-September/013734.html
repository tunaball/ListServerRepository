EXCUSE ME!!!  I was being very polite in my original post.  I had no 
way of knowing what the story behind the original post was.  He's now 
said he meant to say he was trying to install 3rd party apps that 
he'd downloaded and burned to DVD+R on a different system, to a newly 
installed Tiger installation.  I have no reason to doubt this, and it 
sounds more believable than what the original post seemed to indicate.

I used to be a registered Mac developer, and as a programmer, I tend 
to take a *VERY* dim view towards Piracy.

Furthermore as someone who now works professionally with data 
retrieval and preservation, I find your comments that people should 
make copies of their original software to be questionable.  If we 
were still using floppies, I'd whole heartily agree, however, with 
commercially pressed CD-ROM's there is basically no need (the jury is 
still out on DVD's, but I'm inclined to agree with you as I don't 
trust the format).  How many commercial CD's have you ever had go bad 
that weren't attributable to someone's carelessness?  The humorous 
part of all of this is that copies of a commercial CD will normally 
go bad before the commercially pressed CD itself.

I won't even comment on the copy protection issue, other than to 
point out that I had said, that maybe this was a problem.
