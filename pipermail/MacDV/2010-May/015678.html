They have a free demo download version to try before you buy.

&gt;<i> My daughter has a long term project that involves making a stop-motion video of a dance performance she's choreographed.  My thoughts are to tape a performance, probably in a dance studio, or maybe on a stage if she gets permission, and then use iMovie to select frames for the stop motion frames and copy them over the other frames to create a stop motion effect.  I'm also thinking that using an older version of iMovie for the editing would be much easier than the new version.  Or is the newest version of iMovie now more friendly for this sort of detailed timeline editing?  I have an old version of FCP 3, but I never got comfortable using it and the learning curve and the time available to complete this project may make using it unrealistic.  Ideally I need a pretty simple workflow that I can demonstrate to her and then let her do the grunt work on her own.  Since my old G4 MDD has power supply problems and is out of commission, she will have to use both her brother's C2D iMac
</I>&gt;<i>  that has FW for import, and maybe then use her Macbook for editing.  Getting the newest version of iLife is not out of the question, if it would work, and I might be willing to get Final Cut Express if it would be the best tool for the job.  Just soliciting opinions on the best way to approach this project.  The dance has already been choreographed and will be performed in a show Thursday night.  I could tape it then, and perhaps again in a studio setting, but mixing the two performances is probably a bad idea since it at least doubles the amount of importing time...
