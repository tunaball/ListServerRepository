<PRE>I sent this email last week but our Servers were having issues so I don't 
think it made it to the list. My apologies if it did and I didn't receive 
a confirmation...

Hiya,

I've mentioned this previously on this list (in passing I think) but 
didn't get any response so I'll mention it again.

I've just completed authoring a project which contains a DVD Studio Pro 
slideshow. Previously I used to import my pics into DSPro (direct from the 
camera or iPhoto in their full size) and set the slides with the dissolve 
transition but the final produced slideshow (burned to disc) would show 
the *transitions* between the shots with crisp images but when the images 
are *still* it looks dreadfully low-res, eg. you could read words on a 
sign in the background of an image during the transition in and out of the 
slide but when the slide was still the words looked pixellated and 
illegible. Sometimes I'd resort to using FinalCutPro to build the 
slideshows - more time consuming but gives more control.

This time, hoping to avoid the pixellated look when making a DSPro 
slideshow, I thought I'd crop and re-sample all my pics in Photoshop to 
720X576 (PAL) so DSPro didn't have to do any re-sampling. The results are 
better but in many slides I could still see a pixellation happening, eg. 
my wife's mouth in one slide almost looks missing but when the transition 
kicks in the details of the lips appear clearly (BTW, this is a standard 
crowd-type shot, not close-ups).

Anyone have any thoughts? Is DSPro lousy at re-sampling. maybe?

The project is 16:9 but the slideshow is set to 4:3. Perhaps that's my 
issue, should I be down-resing my images to 640X480 instead?

Your pointers are most appreciated!!!

Cheers,

Cojcolds
</PRE>
