<PRE>I've read many posts debating the PAL/NTSC format and thought I'd throw 
in two cents worth...

Why not consider shooting in a more universal format capable of being 
converted either to NTSC or PAL...?

1) Shoot 16mm film or 35mm film, which can easily be converted from 
24fps to either NTSC or PAL... where the caveat would be (at the 
feature film level) the six figure cost for film and lab, and, well, 
the additional film transfer cost, adding quite a bit more to the 
bottom line.

However to save a ton of money...

2) Shoot 24P (frame based 24 frame (not field based) per second video, 
starting with the Panasonic AG-DVX100 at $3,379.95 (B&amp;H Photo), which, 
given the digital format, and true 24P capability, should digitally 
translate either to NTSC or PAL even with the slight magnification of 
image size this might entail. There are a variety of digital frame rate 
conversions, where 24 frames per second is a perfect jumping off point. 
Getting to true FRAMES (not field based video) is the key, and is 
possible with the inexpensive Panasonic described . When the footage is 
in 24P format, it will be possible to convert it relatively 
universally... and the result will be superior to converting ordinary 
NTSC to PAL, where field and frame rate conversion-based artifacts 
always limit the quality of the conversion. Certain countries, Germany, 
in particular, are very quality oriented as to their video, and until 
24P video arrived to democratize translation possibilities, only a very 
few NTSC to PAL conversions were acceptable to them.

While high def, such as the 24P video produced by the Sony CineAlta, 
due to its higher than broadcast video (NTSC _or_ PAL) resolution, 
offers the best possible conversion to NTSC or PAL, even the lesser 
video resolution offered by the DVX100, due to its ability to generate 
pure 24P (see www.dvfilm.com for more info), and due to the clean 
manner by which well shot digital images can be slightly enlarged 
without massive problems, I suspect DVX100 24P to PAL should surpass 
any standard definition NTSC to PAL transfer, even that of many 
broadcast cameras. The translation to NTSC, of course, is de facto 
within the camera itself, which utilizes a 3:2 pulldown to record 24P 
to an NTSC tape.

Thus, I would suggest this new Panasonic should be the camera of choice 
for all working independently, with what some producers might call 
&quot;micro budgets&quot; with the intent to distribute globally.
