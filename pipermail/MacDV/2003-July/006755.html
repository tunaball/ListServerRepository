<PRE>Another note as to mixing media:

No problem at all in Final Cut. You could mix DigiBeta, Beta SP, 
MiniDV, DVCAM, and even XL1 Video (pseudo MiniDV.) You would either 1) 
translate the lesser formats (MiniDV) upward, or 2) transfer the Beta 
formats to DVCAM. It is becoming a popular option to transfer older 
Beta and Umatic formats to DVCAM for archiving here in Los Angeles. The 
4:1:1 color depth of DVCAM is a little more problematic as to post 
options such as blue and green screen work, but even these issues are 
being addressed currently. &quot;Going home&quot; to the viewer, DVCAM is 
essentially indistinguishable from Beta, given you use a camera like 
the PD150 in a professional manner, with all the other trappings being 
the same as you would find on a Beta SP shoot. Good lighting, good 
tripod, etc.

I had a show where Beta SP, DVCAM, and MiniDV were all mixed. The 
MiniDV cameras gave themselves away with their limited image quality, 
but were still very respectable after color and density correction (via 
Final  Cut's Three Color Corrector, primarily.) The DVCAM from the 
PD150 and the Beta SP from the broadcast cameras are essentially 
impossible to tell apart. Equals. The PD150 looks so good next to the 
broadcast Beta SP footage, that one of the producers involved actually 
switched to the PD150 from his Beta gear. He has a weekly show on ESPN, 
and no one has seen the change. Equivalency at a fraction of the price. 
This is referring to standard editing. No blue or green screens.

But then, it's just a sports show...

As to the 24P format on the AG DVX100A, Apple has been working with 
Panasonic to ensure Final Cut's position as the editing solution of 
choice for the camera.
