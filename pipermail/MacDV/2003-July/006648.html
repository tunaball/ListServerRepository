<PRE>When I first read the complaints about the G5 advertisement, I thought 
a &quot;kid&quot; aka baby or small child under the age of 10, was blown through 
the wall. I finally saw the G5 ad on VH1 last night. The &quot;kid&quot; is some 
high school or college aged person.

If a complaint should be raised, it should be that this ad, like all 
Apple ads, doesn't say much about the hardware or show it in use. Jeff 
Goldbloom's voiceover doesn't mention any of the special features of 
the G5 (world's first 64-bit processor in a desktop computer, up to 8 
GB of RAM, up to 1 GHz front-side bus, etc.).

A much better version of the ad would go something like this:

Establishing shot of woman and man in a doorway. Woman kisses young man 
on cheek and says she'll be ready in a few minutes. Guy replies great 
and he will do a little work while she is getting ready. Cut to shot of 
guy as he sits down in front of G5 and 23in Cinema Display. Cut to 
camera panning around the G5 as Goldbloom's voiceover begins touting 
G5's unique features. Cut to close up of hand reaching for G5 power 
button or Apple optical mouse. Loud explosion of noise. Cut to doorway 
and woman comes in and asks, &quot;Honey, are you OK?&quot; She looks up. Cut to 
close-up. Cut to her POV and we see a hole in the shape of a person 
through the walls of the house. Cut to view from outside of house 
looking back at holes. Cut to close up of guys face. Goldbloom's 
voiceover says, &quot;The new PowerMac G5: It will blow you away.&quot;

(Then of course there is the wonderful T2 style promo featuring an 
Arnold voiceover that I have had in mind for weeks.)
