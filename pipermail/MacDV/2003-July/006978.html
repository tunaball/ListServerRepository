<PRE>Okay, here comes my reply :)  Thank you, everyone, for your help!:

</I>
Yes, that was pretty much my interpretation too.

Darn =(  I suppose I shouldn't jump on the bandwagon.

Thank you for the info :) Fortunately I won't be doing anything too 
significant with the photo montage videos; they will be for the 
customers' personal use (I hope).

Darn again, and thanks very much :)

Good point. Not that Steve Jobs is right (now that I have read all 
replies to my thread), but like others have said, there is no real harm 
done so no one seems to care.
