<PRE>I have the Panasonic AG DVX100A, the Sony PD150, and have an entire 
feature film shot on the Canon XL1 and XL1s (not my cameras.)

The Canon XL1, all flavors, is AMATEUR level video. Poor low light 
handling, and worse, offers something called &quot;frame mode&quot; which 
essentially wrecks a shoot with very soft footage. Funny it offers 
interchangeable lenses...

The Panasonic and Sony cameras are definitely several levels above the 
XL1, and make for usable 2-camera shooting in regular video modes.

HOWEVER, the Panasonic's 24P shooting option, particularly under the 
right filtration, is 1) in a class by itself, and 2) allows post 
producing, with relative ease, to all the world video standards. This 
is something the Sony PD150 cannot do, unless you buy the PD150 in each 
of the world video standards (PAL versions are available in the U.S. 
through places like B&amp;H.)

The Panasonic also has a lot of promise with its pseudo manual focus 
ability, which is the ONLY focus option in 24P shooting. By the way, 
the AG DVX100A has TWO 24P modes, one real, one not.

If you took the guts of the Panasonic or Sony and gave it the XL1's 
lens interchangeability, THEN you'd have something very cool.

Now, the Panasonic records in MINI DV, which, like the XL1, is an 
amateur format. HOWEVER, the Panasonic, UNLIKE the XL1, uses a PLL 
circuit to sync the audio to picture. The XL1 records using an ODD 
variable bit rate, and is the PRIME REASON Final Cut Pro has the &quot;Sync 
Adjust&quot; option. The XL1 records &quot;out of sync&quot; as standard. Loads of fun 
when duping! Not only that, but the XL1 does not record standard Mini 
DV format, it records a Canon variant of Mini DV. This has driven many 
people NUTS in post when basically nothing Sony will play anything 
Canon XL1 (but not ALWAYS, because the XL1, as it drifts, eventually 
records so that a Sony deck might read it.) The solution to XL1 is the 
JVC Pro Mini DV Decks, which read ANYTHING XL1, including its average 
to not so great video quality. It is unfortunate the XL1 looks so cool 
and thus has all its adamant believers. The video, especially in frame 
mode, is, well, not so great.

The PD150 records in DVCAM format, which is a broadcast format, unlike 
MiniDV. It is in sync all the time. Like Beta SP or Digi Beta, etc.
This is not to say the PD150 cannot shoot in Mini DV, it can, but why? 
True, DVCAM runs faster, and a 60 minute tape becomes a 40, but this is 
immaterial, unless you are shooting solely for fun as an amateur.

The PD150 is on par with the AG DVX100A, and both are heads and 
shoulders above the XL1 in many ways, beginning with their inclusion of 
  color LCD viewfinders, making handheld work impossible for the XL1 a 
piece of cake. True, you can strap stuff on the XL1 to try to make it 
like the Sony or Panasonic (remember the cult of the XL1), but all the 
strapped on stuff is INCLUDED on these more professional cameras. Like 
XLR audio with phantom power for real mics. The XL1 uses amateur audio 
that requires amateur connectors and much care to NOT screw up when 
shooting. More variables for error. Essentially, it's a stretch and a 
balancing act to make the XL1 do what the Panasonic or Sony does, and 
ONLY the Panasonic does 24P.

Sorry for the rant,

Richard Brown
