<PRE>The $259 price of the Canopus transcoder is exactly the same for both 
platforms and the drivers are in the operating systems, Quicktime and 
the video editing applications - not in the Canopus hardware. Not only 
is your plan out of date and your budget non-existent, your information 
is wrong. You need a sponsor.

To the person who thinks it is unethical to buy a camcorder for 
transcoding and return it within the unlimited return time for a refund 
- this guy is broke. This is not illegal. It is within some store 
return policy guidelines. Therefore it is not necessarily unethical to 
get his job done this way. It is a matter of opinion. The ethics of it 
is debatable. I understand where you are coming from. I agree with you 
to some extent. It's not something I do myself. But this guy is BROKE. 
How else is he going to get it done if he thinks that $259 for a 
Canopus transcoder is too much money and he even thinks it is 
overpriced because he's going to use it on a Mac - which is totally not 
the fact of the matter?
