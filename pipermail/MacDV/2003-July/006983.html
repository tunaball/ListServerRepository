<PRE>My point is that DivX (or DIVx, who cares) is a rip-off of MPEG-4 
before the standard was finalized.  Those who did that and now use it 
are doing the same frustrating thing that Microsoft is trying to do 
with its &quot;Microsoft MPEG-4 V1/2/3 VKI Codec&quot; -- embrace, extend, 
fragment, and make the standard their proprietary product.  Why can't 
we all just get along?  Why do we have to suffer through fragmentation 
of every standard that is attempted?  DivX doesn't improve on MPEG-4, 
it just confuses and fragments the market and causes playback 
compatibility problems that spawned this discussion thread.
