<PRE>Hi Richard,

I'm also in Japan; own the MX5000 (953 in the US, MX500 in Europe). It
compares favorably with the 950, not quite as good as the VX2000 -- but
at less than half the price it shouldn't be as good as the VX2000.

Tapes shot in the MX5000 play fine in my Sony decks (WV-DR5, DSR80 and
DSR20). Panny is being very aggressive on pricing -- best bang for the
buck out there in my opinion. We've taken footage from my MX5000 to air,
no problem.

Now, they've just released the replacement for the MX5000 -- called the
GS100k. It improves a bit on low light (still not nearly as good as the
VX2000), better lens and ccds and does 16:9 better for use on the wide
screen TVs here. It's only a bit more than the now discontinued MX5000
-- but I haven't seen any reviews of it's picture quality.

No real experience with the Canon camera.

&gt;<i> Hello
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been using a Canon PV1 (Elura I think??) But I have had a dead pixel,
</I>&gt;<i> battery performance is poor and have had trouble playing tapes back in Sony
</I>&gt;<i> decks and camera's which most of the studio's/output centers that I work
</I>&gt;<i> with are using.  I am also doing more video work on a semi proffesional
</I>&gt;<i> basis and need a bit more performance, but I would not like it to be too
</I>&gt;<i> big, the vx-2000 was a bit big for my liking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am considering 3 models, the Sony DSR-TRV950, the Canon XV2 and the
</I>&gt;<i> Panasonc MX5000. I am in Japan and have a budget of about 230,000yen (2000
</I>&gt;<i> dollars)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Will the footage shot with the Panasonic and Canon models play back tapes in
</I>&gt;<i> a Sony deck/Camera?? This is my main concern, but I was also wondering what
</I>&gt;<i> the performance was like on the Panasonic was like compared with the Sony
</I>&gt;<i> which seems to be the obvious choice amongst the Japanese. I noticed that on
</I>&gt;<i> the VX2000 even the quality of the tape mechanism was so much better than
</I>&gt;<i> the cheaper options could this also be said in the TRV950?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would love to hear your experiences!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Richard
