<PRE>Hi!

I have also been interested in transferring some old 8mm films to 
digital media, though I think it may really be an excuse to satisfy my 
urge to tinker.

Anyway, I am in the process of digitizing my 8mm film through my Nikon 
Coolscan 4000.  I've got it set up to accept strips of 8mm film (which 
have been cut from the roll) and scan the individual frames 
sequentially.  This takes an enormous of amount of time (tedious work 
with no &quot;tinkering&quot; fun), so I am in the process of building a 
motorized transport to feed the 8mm film automatically through the 
scanning unit.  I'm trying to program a controller (an old Mac IIci), 
which controls the motorized transport (an adapted motor and film 
transport mechanism from an old 8 mm projector)  to feed the film 
through the unit one reel at a time ... stopping every so many frames 
so that the Coolscan can scan the loaded frames, then resume feeding 
the film through until the next set of frames to be scanned.  I am 
having some problems with the alignment using this method.

Once I have this test reel digitized, I can clean, manipulate, correct 
each individual frame or section of frames.  I haven't begun this 
process yet.

My questions really relate to the processing of these frames (which are 
individual image files) after they have all been acquired.  Do I bring 
them directly into a video editor and combine them to form clips which 
will play at an appropriate frame rate?  Do I need to convert them 
first?  I have a feeling that QT Pro will accomplish what I need and 
then allow me to export the finished project into DV format, but I have 
really looked into it.  Any ideas?  What is the frame rate for 8mm and 
super 8mm?

Looking forward to any comments ...

L
