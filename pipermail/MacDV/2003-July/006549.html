</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes to both queries. I find that AAC provides a fuller, richer sound 
</I>&gt;<i> than MP3 overall (particularly on well-known MP3 &quot;trouble spots&quot; like 
</I>&gt;<i> high-hat cymbals or deep bass). In addition, AAC (while still a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lossy&quot; compression like MP3 and therefore inferior to AIFF) provides 
</I>&gt;<i> better fidelity at lower bitrates than MP3, saving space. For example, 
</I>&gt;<i> a 128 AAC is roughly akin to a 192 MP3 ... a savings of about 33% 
</I>&gt;<i> space-wise, with no appreciable loss in fidelity. Over the course of 
</I>&gt;<i> several gigs of music, that can REALLY add up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More importantly from the point of view of Apple and other companies 
</I>&gt;<i> that want to sell songs, AAC has provided for levels of Digital Rights 
</I>&gt;<i> Management (DRM), aka copy protection. Apple has their sets EXTREMELY 
</I>&gt;<i> lightly and the average consumer wouldn't even notice it. Microsoft 
</I>&gt;<i> has taken a more ... &quot;draconian&quot; ... approach so far and looks like 
</I>&gt;<i> they will continue to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, in a nutshell: AAC provides benefits to consumers (better sound, 
</I>&gt;<i> less space) and producers (copyright protection). Honest consumers 
</I>&gt;<i> will not notice the DRM so it's not onerous, determined pirates will 
</I>&gt;<i> find a way around it anyway (but are now subject to prosecution). AAC 
</I>&gt;<i> may never REPLACE the MP3 format, but with lawsuits now being filed 
</I>&gt;<i> against individual music &quot;traders,&quot; it's likely to become the format 
</I>&gt;<i> of choice for honest music fans who want to buy music online.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does iTunes still have the full functions with mp3 and aiff?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why won't it just make mp3's out of them if it will makke aiff's?  seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> silly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not if you've ever heard of &quot;Kazaa&quot; it doesn't. Apple has a strong 
</I>&gt;<i> vested interest in making it difficult for people to rip Apple Music 
</I>&gt;<i> Store tracks and spread them around on the file-&quot;trading&quot; services. 
</I>&gt;<i> And I suppose the reason that unprotected AACs are *also* difficult to 
</I>&gt;<i> make into MP3s is a) there's no reason to make them MP3s if you have 
</I>&gt;<i> an iPod, and b) they're trying to discourage you from choosing MP3 as 
</I>&gt;<i> your format of choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for encoding the physical music you already own, you're free to 
</I>&gt;<i> make MP3s out of em if you want to. And there is a way to re-encode 
</I>&gt;<i> AACs as MP3s if you're really desperate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Is this format going to become a thing to encode one's uploaded 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> music with?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nope. I don't see the &quot;stolen music&quot; crowd going with AAC much, 
</I>&gt;<i> despite the space savings. It's just not universal enough yet.

Thanks Charles,

 When I speak of uploads I am mostly talking about  either original 
music produced by myself or &quot;one-off&quot; things for friends and colleagues.
 I just don't like the idea of MP3 becoming difficult t use and then 
maybe a client gives me his company song as an MP3.
  I have heard of Kaaaza but I use limewire. I am not ashamed. There 
have always been three types of pirating going back to cassettes for me 
(well 8trk too)
 One type will take a cassette (MP3) and then if they like it, buy the 
product.
another type just wannts to expand their horizons a bit and can't afford 
every record in the store.
Third type isn't gonnna buy no matter what you do and does not care 
about fidelity.
With the demise one might say, of free-form radio and the loss of the 
ability to progarm a listening show in general as well as corporate 
takeovers, the file trading market serves the same purpose as college 
radio (which can be pretty spotty) and the old style stations, for 
exposing people to new and old stuff.
 When my nephew asks me about &quot;hideaway&quot; on the first John Mayall and 
the Bluesbreakers album I figure he didn't hear it on the radio. I 
didn't even hear it on the radio when it was new. To me it is gratifying 
that this material can live in this forum.
Then therre's like &quot;woodstock&quot; by CSNY . Hey I already bought the album 
twice, can't I have a downlaod?
Or &quot;Drifting&quot; by Jimi Hendrix. I have paid full price for this item 
twice and been satisfied. If I pass the legend along am I really doing harm?
I would like an Mp3 of the American Idols singing Burt Bacharach's &quot;what 
the world needs now&quot;. They owe me that for watching the stupid show.
I am a songwriter and ASCAP member but I do have these opinions.
Rant mode off.
 Thanks again Chas,
 Jim
