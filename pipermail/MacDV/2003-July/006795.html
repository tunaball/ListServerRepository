<PRE>The only way I'm aware of for merging clips together into one is using Quicktime Pro. 

What you do is put the clips on the timeline in iMovie in the order you want, editing it however you wish. You export that to a full quality Quicktime movie.

Outside of iMovie, you open your exported mov file (Quicktime movie file) in Quicktime Player. Under the File Menu you go to Export. In the dialog box that appears for saving you choose &quot;Movie to DV stream&quot; as the format to use and save your movie as a DV file.

That DV file can then be imported into iMovie as a single clip.

Subject: [MacDV] iMovie question
From: KathyMac! 
Message-Id: &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/macdv.html">27E856F8-BD63-11D7-BA21-00306556DE24 at MusiCareOnline.org</A>&gt;

When working with clips in the right pane of iMovie is there a way to 
&quot;merge&quot; 2 clips together to form one? For instance, I have an 
introductory screen for 28 seconds and then the intro to a show for 
1:03. They are broken into 2 clips. Rather than have it that way, I 
would like to combine both of those clips to form on that is 1:31 long.

How do you do that? I don't see any merge feature. I know you're 
probably thinking, &quot;what does it matter how long the individual clips 
are in the clip holder pane? You can build your movie timeline below 
any way that you want.&quot;

That's not the point though. I like my clips organized. I hate having 
one that is a few seconds especially when it fits nice and logical at 
the front of the next clip - hence, they should be one.
Without reimporting, is there a way to manipulate clips like this and 
reorganize them and customize them?

By the way, I notice that when importing an hour or two of tape each 
clip captured maxes out at 9:28 in time before breaking off to make a 
new clip. That is the reason I am having some of these problems when it 
comes time to cut things up accordingly. When I start cutting clips to 
sort them according to scene and act 1, act 2, etc....I end up with 20 
second little clips leftover that need to be merged with it's mother 
clip!

Someone help this neurotic movie maker....
