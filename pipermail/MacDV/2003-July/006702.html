What ever happened to the idea that what you *do* with the computer is 
more important than which one currently has the fastest CPU?  That's 
Windows marketing - because they're all the same aside from a few tech 
spec details.

The tank ad was good, because back then the Mac still suffered from 
folklore wisdom that its &quot;slow&quot;. It was a problem than needed to be 
addressed. That's not a problem now. Does Apple really think that the 
most important thing it delivers to its users is a faster CPU than a 
PC? Its a slap in the face of the whole Mac concept.
