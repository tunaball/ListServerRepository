Considering the time and hassle involved running things through the 
computer in order to burn a DVD of your tapes, have you looked at 
standalone DVD recorders?

I have a Panasonic DMR HS-2 that I got a heck of a deal on from Best 
Buy because it was a customer return.

I got a $1K+ machine (at the time) for $499, which was even less than 
the price they'd stuck on the box. Only the manual was missing, and I 
downloaded it from the Panasonic website as a PDF, then printed it.

The major benefit of this device is that I don't need to spend a whole 
day tying up the computer just to schlep a 2 hour VHS tape to DVD.

I can burn directly to DVD in real time, or go to the hard-drive if I 
need to do some trimming or whacking.  A playlist feature lets me burn 
to DVD files (recorded programs) that stored on the hard drive in the 
order I want.

I use this flexible tool to burn client review copies of ongoing 
projects, create DVD's of clients' VHS tapes, transfer  Powerpoint or 
Keynote presentations to DVD (S-Video out of computer into S-video in 
on DMR HS-2), and to time-shift programs using the 40GB Hard Drive.

I've also used it as a long-form recorder when a customer needed to 
have her sleep recorded over an eight-hour period for her doctor to 
review.

A Sony camcorder w/Nightshot supplied the infrared illuminated video 
(no lights on in the room) and sent audio from a lav mike attached to a 
headboard. The hard-drive recorded the entire evening's snooze.  All I 
had to do was set it up, show the older lady how to roll the hard drive 
in record (that's a new phrase) and then burn a set of DVD's for her.

If you are pulling dozens of clips from your VHS tapes and editing them 
into a program, then by all means, you need to burn from the computer.

For the simple transfers as I've described, I can't see why anyone 
would go through several hours of sucking the content into the 
computer, then have to use DVD creation software to continue the 
process for the half-a-day or longer (generally longer) it will take to 
see whether you've burned a coaster, or not.

My 50 kroner.

Ted.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have the machine (MDD Dual), the software and am ready to get the 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware
</I>&gt;<i> to convert my tapes, etc. to DVD. The local store has both the 
</I>&gt;<i> Pinnacle and
</I>&gt;<i> Pyro units in stock. So, before I buy anything, I wanted to tap into 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> collective wisdom of you on this list. Here's what I'd like: I'd like 
</I>&gt;<i> an external
</I>&gt;<i> converter that goes both ways with most of the common ports. I'd also 
</I>&gt;<i> like to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to watch and record stuff off my cable system. I'm guessing that 
</I>&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;<i> require two different purchases. I'd like it to be Firewire based. Of 
</I>&gt;<i> course, the
</I>&gt;<i> option of being bus powered would be a nice addition. Mostly, I'd like 
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> recommendations and suggestions regarding the units you've used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A while ago, I had looked at the unit from Formac, but have heard a 
</I>&gt;<i> number of
</I>&gt;<i> negative reports, so I'm hesitant. I've read reviews of the DAC, Sony,
</I>&gt;<i> Canopus and one other that I can't remember, but i wanted to get your 
</I>&gt;<i> input before
</I>&gt;<i> buying. So, if any of you have had good or bad experiences with any of 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> converters, please speak up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> STeve
