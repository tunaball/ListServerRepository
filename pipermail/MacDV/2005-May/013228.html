&gt;<i> This is probably a bit OT, but might be of use to those who have

</I>&gt;<i> I am surprised that there has not been  a lot of postings regarding
</I>&gt;<i> the operation, or rather,  non-operation of third-party Applications
</I>&gt;<i> following upgrading to  10.4  (&quot;Tiger&quot;).    From memory,  only one
</I>&gt;<i> member has raised an issue.
</I>
I waited about a week and a half after 10.4 was released before I
upgraded. During that time I watched VersionTracker for updates for
3rd-party apps and applied them as they came along. So by the time I
upgraded to 10.4, most of the apps I use were already ready for it.

&gt;<i> In speaking to several other Mac Users I have found that I am not the
</I>&gt;<i> only one to be having trouble in running such Applications as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Cocktail&quot;, &quot;Techtool&quot;, &quot;SnapZPro&quot; &quot;,ffMPEG&quot;, &quot;Graphic Converter&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Virex 7.5&quot;,   and so on.....             Those, including me, with
</I>&gt;<i> Epson Printers are finding they must also reload the Drivers.
</I>
For Tiger, you should have these versions:
Cocktail 3.6.1
Techtool Pro 4.0.4
GraphicConverter 5.6.1 (or one of the more-recent betas)
Virex (I've never upgraded from 7.2, and it seems to be OK with Tiger)

As for the other apps you mentioned, I don't see specific Tiger
versions yet in VersionTracker.

I too had a problem with my Epson Stylus Photo R200 printer, but
removing it and re-adding it in the Printer Setup Utility got it
working.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All Apple Apps. are working OK  as far as I can determine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apparently the kernel for 10.4 is quite different from 10.3 and Third
</I>&gt;<i> Party developers need to come up with patches etc.   As these
</I>&gt;<i> developers were provided with Beta copies of 10.4 as early as the
</I>&gt;<i> last Mac Developers Conference in San Francisco it would have been
</I>&gt;<i> hoped that they could have been ready for the release of Tiger.
</I>&gt;<i> An Apple Club member here in Adelaide has suggested to me not to try
</I>&gt;<i> and run any maintenance Applications until they have been upgraded.
</I>&gt;<i> These include&quot; Cocktail&quot; and &quot;TechTool&quot;, but do not include Mac&quot; Disk
</I>&gt;<i> Utility&quot;.  I think his suggestion is a good one and I am heeding his
</I>&gt;<i> advice.    In the meantime I am going back to my OSX 10.3.9 partition
</I>&gt;<i> to use some of the Third Party  Apps..
</I>
As mentioned above, new versions of Cocktail and TechTool Pro are
available (as well as DiskWarrior).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For those &quot;Tiger&quot; users that may be interested,  I quote from a
</I>&gt;<i> portion of an IT column in last Tuesday's &quot;Australian&quot;:-
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A nastily designed widget, once installed and running, could erase
</I>&gt;<i> files and directories, run malevolent scripts, change ownerships and
</I>&gt;<i> permissions. or capture passwords and send them out to an unknown
</I>&gt;<i> server.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far no one has reported any such widget, but it could happen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's a simple step Tiger users can use to protect their Macs;  go
</I>&gt;<i> to the Preferences file for Safari, look for the &quot;Open Safe Files
</I>&gt;<i> after downloading&quot; box and remove the tick that it contains.
</I>
The OS X 10.4.1 update addresses some of those security issues. Now,
when you download something (like a .dmg) that contains an app or
widget, Safari puts up an alert that says something similar to &quot;[name
of file] is [or contains] an application. Are you sure you want to
download the file [name of file]?&quot;

&gt;<i> Now you can download widgets to your heart's content.   They won't
</I>&gt;<i> run until you instruct them to and a non-running widget can do no harm.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The journalist suggests  Apple should supply future versions of
</I>&gt;<i> Safari with the auto-install-and-run option disabled by default.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ian Tucker.
