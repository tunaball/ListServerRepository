<PRE>I needed an A/D converter for some of my old VHS tapes and, since I 
didn't want to invest too much for the low quality videos, I ended up 
buying a Miglia Alchemy TV DVR for $149.95.  It has composite and 
S-Video inputs and also a TV tuner build in.  For the purpose of 
digitizing VHS it has all the quality I needed.  Just as a test I ran a 
commercial DVD through the S-video to my old Mac and it happily 
converted it to a Quicktime file  (8.6 GB for an hour and 55 minutes 
with the setting I had there at the time) and the quality is pretty OK 
considering the very reasonable price of the unit.  I have not tried to 
digitize a commercial VHS tape, but my feeling is that it would do that 
as well.
I was running the DVD on my old 400 Sawtooth and it was working all the 
way on the max, processor running between 92 to 97%, occasionally maxing 
at 100 (no easily detectable drop-out though).  The unit is compatible 
also with G5, but I haven't tried that yet, because I have other things 
I want to do on my G5 and seldom would have time to tie it for long 
digitizing runs.  It says in the package that &quot;Full screen MPEG-4 
requires G4/1GHz&quot;.
For the purpose I acquired the unit, it performs in a satisfactory way 
and also gives me an opportunity to record TV programs, should I need 
that function.  It also has iCal scheduling and TitanTV support (haven't 
tried either one yet).

Rauno.
