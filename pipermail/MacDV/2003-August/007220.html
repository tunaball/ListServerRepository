<PRE>When I got the Erica's first iMovie book as I looked through it my first
thoughts were that Erica had to much free time on her hands to play with
iMovie because of all the different project ideas and details steps she
when to to find ways to do things in iMovie.  Within weeks I had
purchased QT pro and discovered I was referring to her book all the time
for ideas and how to do things to make iMovie perform like alot more
expensive package.

I know without her book I would not have done nearly as much with iMovie
as I have done in the last year.  I no longer loan my out because I
refer to it so much I tell people they can look at it at my house but
they will have to go buy one if they want to try any of the projects.

The down side of this is that without Erica's book I don't think I would
have stayed with iMovie as long as I have.  I would problably upgraded
to FCP or FCE but I am not sure I would have made it as far as I have
with them as I have with iMovie and Erica's book.

Thanks Erica......
