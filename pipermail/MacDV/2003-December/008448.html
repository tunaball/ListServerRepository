</I>&gt;<i> Hmm. I'm not sure what you mean by equivalent repeatability, but 
</I>&gt;<i> here's what I meant. Using Capture Now means that you don't spend any 
</I>&gt;<i> time looking through the footage and logging it. You only log the 
</I>&gt;<i> reel, so that if you do need to recapture, you will know which tape to 
</I>&gt;<i> fetch (assuming, as I can with you, that you've properly labeled the 
</I>&gt;<i> tape). Then, while that project remains active, you are using a lot of 
</I>&gt;<i> HD space. But that's why you have a large HD for that purpose. Then, 
</I>&gt;<i> when you are finished with your project and have exported your final 
</I>&gt;<i> product, you can dump your media files off that HD. But, by keeping 
</I>&gt;<i> the project file, if you should later wish to go back and edit, you 
</I>&gt;<i> can simply open the file. FCP will then ask you to either reconnect 
</I>&gt;<i> the media (which you can't because you've deleted it), or to 
</I>&gt;<i> recapture. At which point, you will be asked for said tapes, which you 
</I>&gt;<i> then let FCP capture again. No logging involved (save the reel number) 
</I>&gt;<i> and minimal wear and tear on your tapes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By using this method, you can avoid both needless logging, and you can 
</I>&gt;<i> avoid the need for much deep storage space since tapes are still much 
</I>&gt;<i> cheaper than HD space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure this is what you need, but I think it would more than do for 
</I>&gt;<i> the original poster in this thread.

Yes that is pretty much what I had in mind.
I'm beat and I am in the Middle of editing and making DVD's. 
(standalone philips yuck)
I don't multitask as well as I'd hoped.
