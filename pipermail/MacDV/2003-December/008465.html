Gibberish in the context of this discussion.

not stupid. I know how a disc works and what are the illusions and what 
are the realities.
  The reality is we need 10's of gigs all ina row so that we miss not 
1/60th of a second of video looking for someplace new to put it. And 
when playing it back after messing with it (more files distributed by 
the software and discs)  the demand for fast location and processing is 
even more important. My stuff has to deliver 3.6 megabytes of carefully 
sequenced material in a continuous stream for two hours. IT gotta be 
clean man!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On top of that, you have all the buffering and cacheing done by the 
</I>&gt;<i> kernel I/O subsystem.  And on top of that, you have unrelated disk 
</I>&gt;<i> accesses done by the OS, such as swap, tempfs, journalling, and i/o 
</I>&gt;<i> for other processes.
</I>
That is why we have dedicated video discs. It bugs me that even the 
muzak comes from the
boot disc but it makes it quicker to reformat the video scratch/capture 
disc. Muzak is like 4 gigs.

&gt;<i> These are going to put the disk heads wherever they want, and attempts 
</I>&gt;<i> to make files contiguously allocated therefore yield insignificant 
</I>&gt;<i> performance improvements except possibly under pathological &gt; conditions.
</I>
Realities of capturing  and playing back video music and rendered 
filles have not changed to the point of pathology. Or people with iMacs 
wouldn't run into brick walls with this stuff.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A separate drive for video is a good idea, but because of dedicated 
</I>&gt;<i> performance, not because of fragmentation.
</I>That one never gets fragmented much. It has no chance.
It's the boot drive where I play. I dl a game, a song, an image,I 
render an animation, I write a letter , I use iPhoto and then delete 
images, all this stuff decreaes contiguous space ( desired for large 
media filles and related renders) and occaisionally the startup comes 
into play in work. Hence it is kept optimized.

&gt;<i>   If you're a true believer in defragmentation then putting your video 
</I>&gt;<i> on a separate partition on the same drive is a terrible idea - it 
</I>&gt;<i> guarantees that all other references to disk will reposition the &gt; heads.
</I>
No partitions, because of what you imply. It splits the heads too, and 
then access and performance suffer. I tried it. No good.

Use Xbench. record your score.
Use Speed disk and Disc warrior.
Reboot.
  Use Xbench again. Compare scores.   Arbitrary but consistent.
