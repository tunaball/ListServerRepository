<PRE>Personally I'm against using Toast as well, but not because of audio sync problems (I didn't see any in the 45 minute test disk I made).  I was most displeased with the quality.  I tried Toast and all the free solutions I could find, and not a single one could produce a decent quality VCD.  They all had way to much pixalization.  I'll continue to make my VCD's on my WinXP system, even though it takes 4-6 hours to encode 30 minutes of video, since by using TMPGenc Plus, I'm able to get better results than some of my *Commercial* DVD's!  I can't wait for the G5 version of Virtual PC, as I want to see how fast I can encode video using TMPGenc on a G5 2x2.

The sad thing is, it looks like it's cheaper to buy a dirt cheap PC and spend $50 on TMPGenc Plus, than it is to buy a decent MPEG1 encoded for the Mac!  I find this very frustrating as I was hoping to switch back to only using the Mac once I got my G5.

&gt;<i>Eric has been very adamant about not using Toast 6 to burn VCD's because of audio synching problems. Is it only when buring VCD's from iMovie that the synching problem occurs? I have been using Toast, both 5 and 6, to burn VCD's since February of this year. All play fine, but I am burning my EyeTV recordings. The VCD format works well because most of the programs I am recording are a half hour in length. The recording quality works fine for programs recorded off of TV. The only audio synch problems I have had have been with an early version of the EyeTV software, but that problem has been fixed. I have gone back and played several of the CD's in my sony dvd player and on my computer and they show no out of synch audio.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have been hesitant about upgrading Toast 5 on my laptop with the superdrive because of the problems that Eric has talked about. I have Toast 6 on my G4 Cube with no DVD burner, just an external CD burner and it works fine.
