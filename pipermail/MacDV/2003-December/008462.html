What would you use. Lousy Drive10?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion would be to have a completely separate drive *just* for 
</I>&gt;<i> video (or even an entirely separate partition on the same physical 
</I>&gt;<i> disk as your System/apps) which you can reformat periodically as

</I>
I do exactly that but occasionaly there is overflow that must have 
somewhere to go.
And personal projects nearly always end up on the startup drive.

&gt;<i>  Nothing defrags a drive like a good formatting...  ;-)  And even if 
</I>&gt;<i> you don't reformat your drive in between projects,

&gt;<i>  the fact that your media files don't have to contend with your system

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's *my* 2 cents anyway...
