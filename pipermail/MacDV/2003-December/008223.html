<PRE>Randy,

You have nothing to worry about. I was in the same boat as you earlier 
this summer, having spent several hours making high-res designs in 
Photoshop. When sent to Final Cut Express and then exported to iDVD, 
they looked gawd awful. I drove myself nuts trying to figure out a 
solution. Turns out I had nothing to worry about.

In a very watered down explanation, iMovie and iDVD take your high 
resolution computer images and converts them into the appropriate 
quality for a television. A television has a much lower resolution than 
your Apple Cinema Display. (Only 512 horizontal lines of resolution for 
a standard television). When you view your rendered project in iMovie 
or iDVD, you are viewing that lower &quot;television quality&quot; image through 
the &quot;high quality&quot; computer display. This highlights the difference in 
resolutions. In the end, everything will be fine.

</I>&gt;<i> completed it in iMovie, he went to &quot;Create iDVD project&quot; and sent it 
</I>&gt;<i> to iDVD 3.01.  When we viewed
</I>&gt;<i> the DVD on an Apple Cinema Display, we noticed that the stills looked 
</I>&gt;<i> horrible.  Basically, they look like low-resolution preview images. 
</I>&gt;<i> However, when you watch closely, the images look nice &amp; sharp DURING 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> transition phases of the image (both at the beginning &amp; end of the 
</I>&gt;<i> photo).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During the time the stills alone appear, they look jagged &amp; very 
</I>&gt;<i> low-quality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're thinking that it's because the stills themselves have not been 
</I>&gt;<i> rendered by iMovie (whereas
</I>&gt;<i> the transitions, obviously, are rendered portions of the video).  We 
</I>&gt;<i> know that if you have the Ken
</I>&gt;<i> Burns effect checked before importing JPEGs, the stills begin 
</I>&gt;<i> rendering once they pop into the shelf.  However, all our JPEGs were 
</I>&gt;<i> imported without the Burns effect selected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our big question is:  now that the iMovies have been completed (ie all 
</I>&gt;<i> the titles &amp; cross-dissolves in place), how do we go about rendering 
</I>&gt;<i> all the digital stills in order to get them to appear high-quality in 
</I>&gt;<i> the final iDVD-created disc? Do we have to remove all the transitions, 
</I>&gt;<i> apply the Burns effect to each still image in  order to make iMovie 
</I>&gt;<i> render them, then re-apply all the transitions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like a huge pain in the butt to me.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Randy
