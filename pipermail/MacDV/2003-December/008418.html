Norm:

My suggestion is to get an external hard drive.

Internal hard drives right now cost less than $1/ per Gigabyte.

Check Staples, Office Max or CompUSA for deals. Get a, as a minimum, at 
7200 rpm, 8mb cache IDE hard drive. You should be able to install this 
pretty quickly in your G$ tower. I forget when the next open forum is 
but someone could do it for you if you want. It is very simple to do. 
Don't worry about drivers, it will work. the trickiest part (IF you 
have to do this) is to get the master/slave relationship between the 
two done correctly the first time.

Alternatively, you can do what I have done and that is buy an internal 
drive and put it in an external case.

go to <A HREF="http://www.compgeeks.com/specials.asp?cat=MAC">http://www.compgeeks.com/specials.asp?cat=MAC</A>
and check out the external cases there. I managed to find one 
(firewire) that accommodated two hard drives (for about $55). To 
install those hard drives took about 15 minutes. To connect it to the 
Mac took about 2 seconds. I did this since I am constantly connecting 
these externals to different computers that don't have the ability to 
add another hard drive (iMac and powerbooks).


to check for deals, go to <A HREF="http://www.dealmac.com">http://www.dealmac.com</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.dealsontheweb.com">http://www.dealsontheweb.com</A>

there should be a number of HD available at very good prices both 
before and after rebates.

I would get at least 120G and devote it entirely to video and NOTHING 
else. Once you are done with a video project download the video files 
on to one or more DVDs (4.7G/DVD) for safe keeping. When you off load a 
file delete it from the hard drive and then run some utility on the 
hard drive to remove any fragmentation of the hard drive to keep it 
moving quickly.


good luck


Juan
