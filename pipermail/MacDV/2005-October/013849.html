Hash: SHA1

I've been having intermittent failures of the USB ports on the back  
of my 17&quot; Studio LCD display that has the ADC connector.  Finally  
called AppleCare and they had me reset PRAM and then boot into Open  
Firmware (hold down cmd-opt-o-f on restart).  That led to a bunch of  
USB errors being generated and replicated the failure of those USB  
ports.  (I've kept a card reader that has a green light pugged into  
one port so I can see when I've got problems...)  The tech had me  
type reset-nvram and then reset-all which rebooted.  So far the  
problem hasn't happened again.  I may take the monitor in anyway  
since I have less than a week of AppleCare coverage left.  The tech  
left and spoke to his manager about the problem and came back and  
told me that it is very likely the display that is causing the  
problem.  This is a known problem.  If you got AppleCare on the  
display I'd take it in just in case.

Regards,
                     Joey Kennedy.
