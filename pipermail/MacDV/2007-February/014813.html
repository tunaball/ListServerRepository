<PRE>To speed things up, you could probably record directly to the DVD
recorder, &quot;live&quot;, bypassing the tape step. In other words, you would
have the camcorder connected to the DVD recorder during the interview,
recording on the DVD recorder as the interview is happening.

</I>&gt;<i> year.  Another purpose is for research to see how the grade is
</I>&gt;<i> progressing and the level the students.   The files are suppose to be
</I>&gt;<i> for each child and also for the class.   The files have to be
</I>&gt;<i> transferred from the tapes.   I am looking for the best and easiest
</I>&gt;<i> and fastest way to transfer them off the tape.   Also the interviews
</I>&gt;<i> will be used in workshops so that is why they need to be on dvds.
</I>&gt;<i> Also the program was part of a grant.  The grant requires we keep
</I>&gt;<i> records of each interview.  By the way we have been using the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> white board with the child's name.

</I>&gt;<i> You didn't give quite enough information to give good advice
</I>&gt;<i> (like, are the interviews for the kids to take home? Stored at
</I>&gt;<i> school? Need to look good? etc.) but assuming this is for
</I>&gt;<i> research, and not for kids to take home to their families, I'd
</I>&gt;<i> use a little white board, write the kid's name on it. Hold it in
</I>&gt;<i> front of the camera and roll the tape. Ten seconds later pull the
</I>&gt;<i> white board away to show the kid, and let the interviewer start
</I>&gt;<i> asking questions. Two interviews per miniDV tape, no copying or
</I>&gt;<i> dubbing (or editing) needed. Two hundred miniDV tapes shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> take up more than 3 shoeboxes worth of storage space.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I am working with a teacher who has a project to interview with a video
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  of each interview for 400 children. The interviews are about 15 -25
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  minutes each.  The only editing is just to make sure the beginning says
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  the child name.  We are using a Sony camcorder with MiniDV.   At the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  present time, we are making DVD's by combining at least 12 interviews on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  one DVD by using a simple DVD recorder/burner. We never save anything to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  a hard drive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  This is time consuming since you have to spend the time to send it the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  DVD recorder.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I am looking for a better solution.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  option #1: So far, it was suggested that we purchase a camcorder that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  will make mini DVD automatically.   For each student there will be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  mini DVD.   No one has to spend the time switching the tape to a DVD.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  The disadvantage is that nothing can be edited and there has to be 400
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  mini dvds which will have to be filed for each child.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  option #2:  Buy a camcorder which has an internal hard drive, edit it on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  the camcorder and then send to a dvd.  This eleminates the wait between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  the interviews and hopefully will allow chapters after each interview.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Otion #3 continue what we are doing and paying someone to edit and switch.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Does anyone have any thoughts on a better way of organizing all these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  interviews in a timely manner.   If we can have to pay for someone to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  switch the interviews we have the money to buy the camcorder for either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  option #1 or #2.
