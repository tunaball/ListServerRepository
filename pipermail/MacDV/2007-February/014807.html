<PRE>
Thank you for your responce.  I did not give you enough information 
because each person gave me a different purpose.  You were correct 
that the interviews are for saving for two purposes.  One purpose is 
for the teacher to see how well a child has improved from year to 
year.  Another purpose is for research to see how the grade is 
progressing and the level the students.   The files are suppose to be 
for each child and also for the class.   The files have to be 
transferred from the tapes.   I am looking for the best and easiest 
and fastest way to transfer them off the tape.   Also the interviews 
will be used in workshops so that is why they need to be on dvds. 
Also the program was part of a grant.  The grant requires we keep 
records of each interview.  By the way we have been using the idea of 
white board with the child's name.

You didn't give quite enough information to give good advice
(like, are the interviews for the kids to take home? Stored at
school? Need to look good? etc.) but assuming this is for
research, and not for kids to take home to their families, I'd
use a little white board, write the kid's name on it. Hold it in
front of the camera and roll the tape. Ten seconds later pull the
white board away to show the kid, and let the interviewer start
asking questions. Two interviews per miniDV tape, no copying or
dubbing (or editing) needed. Two hundred miniDV tapes shouldn't
take up more than 3 shoeboxes worth of storage space.

</I>&gt;<i>  Otion #3 continue what we are doing and paying someone to edit and switch.
