No need to be hostile toward him. He uses his PCs to run Linux &amp; Unix. 
He tried to use XP so he could watch the DVD on it. I think his main 
intent is to watch it on his home player, and that should work fine. He 
was just informing me of his inability, not getting on my case for it. 
He's just as critical of M$ as anyone I know.

I was just trying to find out if others have had trouble. Thanks for 
letting me know that you haven't.

I think that Erica may be right, some kind of combination of media (I 
did use a cheapie for this) and laser. Anyway it plays fine on my 
PowerBook and on my home player (old Sony model), so it'll probably 
work fine on his home player.
