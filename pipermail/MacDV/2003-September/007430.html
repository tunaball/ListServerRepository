<PRE>You're right.  I over-reacted.  Sorry.  I spend many hours of my days 
in defense of Macs where I work.  I've developed a short fuse in this 
area.  Often the problem is user error, but Mac-bashing has become a 
common thing on this campus.  I can't decide if it's actual hatred, 
jealousy of superior technology, or just to watch mac users squirm.  
The best defense is a good offense.  It wasn't called for in this case.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that Erica may be right, some kind of combination of media (I
