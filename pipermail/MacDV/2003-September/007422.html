<PRE>Yes, it should recognize it.  All I know is that I've burned dozens of 
projects to DVDs using iDVD.  They have worked fine on a few PCs I've 
tried them on, but that's not really important.  More important, they 
have worked without fail in every DVD player I've ever tried them on, 
or for those to whom I've sent them.

If some guy's wintel computer using XP can't run DVDs made on a Mac 
that comply with published standards, guess who's problem it is.

No help, or sympathy for your friend, here.  Maybe he should check his 
config.sys.  (Sorry, couldn't resist.)
