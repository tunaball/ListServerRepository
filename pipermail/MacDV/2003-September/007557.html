</I>
Make a copy of your iMovie project file. Then open it in
TextEdit. Scan through the file and make sure that all
the media actually appears in your original project Media
folder. I suspect you lost a clip or two along the way.

As a rule, don't mess with your Media folder unless you're
really confident about what you're doing.

As for the reference movie, it will rebuild when you open
and save your iMovie project.
