This is beginning to give me a headache...

My problems began with this project when I found that iMovie 3.03 would 
not allow me to import footage from two other events w/o crashing.  To 
get around this limitation I did each event as a separate iMovie 
project and saved each finished project to disk as a full quality QT DV 
stream.  This gave me two .mov files.  The third project is short and 
maybe 8 minutes, and I didn't bother saving it as a QT DV file, but 
instead dropped the iMovie reference movie from the project folder into 
iDVD instead...  (a light goes on in my head already!)  When I preview 
the DVD in iDVD before burning the sound is there.  But when I burn to 
a disk image (following instructions using the hurz/pfurz hack 
discussed earlier here...) the resulting image has both a video_ts and 
an audio_ts file at the root level of the disk.  When I open this in 
DVD player to preview it before I begin the massive burning of the 
disks, there is no sound.  These need to be ready by Wednesday!  Any 
ideas?

By just writing this note I was forced to analyze what I've done so 
far, and I now suspect that if  I were to save the third part of the 
project as a QT DV .mov that I might yet succeed...  At least this 
seems like a good first step, since it shouldn't take long compared to 
having to start over again, which would really make the deadline 
impossible to meet :-)  On a more positive note, when I made a DVD 
using the .dmg, the DVR-109 offered to burn it at 4x on the DVD-R's 
that I believed to be 2x...  That in itself cuts the burn time in half 
yet again!

Still hopeful.
			Joey.
