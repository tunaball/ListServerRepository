I do get it and I do listen.  I may not have been a Mac user long 
enough to be one of the Mac &quot;faithful&quot; as I switched just last year and 
have no use for OS 9 myself, but I think I have a different, and 
frankly, clearer perspective on this whole situation than some of the 
&quot;faithful&quot; who want things to stay the way they've always been.

They aren't penalizing you - none of you OS 9 users.  They're not 
sending out evil rays to disable your perfectly functioning machines.  
They're just not expending any further effort (nor should they) to 
support you with respect to their current product offerings.

You say &quot;there is no reason they can't...&quot; as if it is a fact.  In 
fact, there is a reason - probably alot of them, in fact.

I joined this list almost a year ago and I saw lots of discussion on 
this topic and variants of it - basically, &quot;boo-hoo, Apple isn't doing 
enough to support us OS 9 users - they're trying to make us move to OS 
X.&quot;  I saw people comment that it was too soon, that they supported 
Apple pushing OS X but that they shouldn't force people to do it too 
soon.  Well, they're *not* forcing you to move to OS X.  It's more than 
a year after the iLamp and iPhoto caught my attention and I know people 
who are running OS 9 on those cool black Powerbooks like the woman uses 
on Sex and the City and they're running OS 9 on them just fine.

You want current development effort to be wasted on people running old 
machines and running outdated OS's.  That's ridiculous - and that's an 
opinion of mine, but it is obviously shared by Apple, which makes it a 
reality.

&gt;<i> There is no reason they can't have a very small team doing some 
</I>&gt;<i> support.
</I>&gt;<i> Don't you think they could SELL some of the iApps, if they made them 
</I>&gt;<i> for OS9?
</I>&gt;<i> I think they could. Shoot, they have a whole team working on OSX on 
</I>&gt;<i> Intel
</I>&gt;<i> machines, that obviously isn't making them any money. We all know that 
</I>&gt;<i> OSX is

</I>&gt;<i> career.
</I>
Yeah, and Microsoft could keep coding versions of Office for Windows 
3.1 or Windows 95 as well - do you think they do it?  Heck no, and I 
bet the number of current Win 3.1 &amp; Win95 users far outnumber the 
number of OS 9 users.

On a more personal level - you can't afford a new machine.  I feel for 
you, even though I certainly can.  But it is simply unrealistic to 
expect Apple to keep one foot in the past while struggling to maintain 
and even gain ground in the market of the future.  Sorry, but Apple's 
already decided it isn't important to sell iApps and other things to 
people in your shoes - not much to be done about it but deal with it 
and move on.
