&gt;<i> You can still run your 9 apps in Classic mode which is often times
</I>&gt;<i> faster than running them natively Kathy. Do you know for sure that what
</I>&gt;<i>  you think you &quot;need&quot; isn't available in X or doesn't run perfectly in
</I>&gt;<i> Classic mode? What apps?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It's really more of a situation that I much prefer working in the native OS9
environment. I like the control of the system folder and the fact that I
know the OS so well for tweaking, customization, tricks etc...
OSX is harder to control and it's not that I don't want to go thru the
learning curve of how to master and control a UNIX system like OS X, it's a
matter of not interrupting my work and stopping life to do so.

I use Cubase for audio. The X version is not as stable and it is different
enough that it too would require some more of a learning curve, slowing down
my work. 

In general, I just want the ablitity to have an OS9 drive AND and OSX drive
for use of the iLife suite and all video work - which will end up getting me
more and more into the world of X without being forced to stop 9 suddenly.

&gt;<i>However Apple is going to
</I>&gt;<i> continue to offer the dual 1.25 GHz MDD with native 9 booting
</I>&gt;<i> capability  maybe at a lower price than now since that speed will
</I>&gt;<i> become the middle model when the next refresh is released. It will be
</I>&gt;<i> the fastest last OS 9 native booting Mac. Maybe it'll have some 2003
</I>&gt;<i> features like FW800. Who knows? Steve.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Are you sure about this? Why would they make the middle model still bootable
in 9 when they said all computers would not have that option? If they do
choose one to stay in an OS9 configuration why do you think it's the 1.25
model? Maybe it would be the 1ghz model?

Kathy
