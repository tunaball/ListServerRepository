It may be great for you, but it's baloney for me, OK? As I said, there are
many who are really thrilled with OSX, incl. Jag. I am not one of them. I
learned as early as system 7 that one does NOT adopt any Apple product
right out of the box unless you want a wrestling match. I usually wait
about a year to move to any new system, especially on mission-critical
machines like those in my audio recording and editing suite. It's long been
part of Apple's corporate culture that they release products in a less than
ready state. No less a luminary than Deke McClelland has been quoted as
saying words to this effect:  the so-called Public Beta was an Alpha. The
actual release was a Beta. And only with 10.1.3 (I may be off here by a
.something) has OSX reached a stage of being a reliable system environment.

And even with that reliability, there are many popular hardware and
software packages that remain unsupported, or sketchily supported, in X,
and that includes your beloved Jaguar. In fact, problems have arisen for
some with 10.2 that seemed to have been resolved in 10.1. Do you read the
posts on this list?

Don't misunderstand. I am aware of the problems involved in a system change
of this magnitude. It's unprecedented in even the innovative history of
Apple. In time, OSX will be a worthy scion of the Apple family, heir to its
legacy of inventive and powerful software that changes the way we work. But
it isn't there yet. And that being the case, it was premature and
inconsiderate of Apple to slam the door on the possibility of staying with
9 until X is right. I'm glad your experience is better than mine. But don't
think everyone is in your shoes. Apple should continue to allow users the
choice to boot in 9. Period.
