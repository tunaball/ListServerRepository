My only intention was to thoroughly slander single chip cameras, not strive
for absolute engineering accuracy. The post was in response to a question
seeking basic orientation.

I would not agree that any 1 chip consumer DV camera of today equals or
comes remotely close to the performance of a $60,000 Ikegami of
yesteryear... you've got to be kidding. Those cameras made spectacular
images. The remarkable thing is how good inexpensive 3-CCD video cameras
have become.

The concept of latest &amp; greatest has its limits. Even today, if you were to
seek out the ultimate in high fidelity audio, you would find a dedicated
group of adherents to analog vinyl records. Same type of case might be made
for pure, raw, full bandwidth, never compressed analog video. Last I
checked, D1 was still the reference in uncompressed NTSC digital video.

&gt;<i> I've shot stuff in bright sunlight with a single-chip Hi8mm camera that
</I>&gt;<i> integrated quite well with sunlight footage shot by a Sony BVW-400 Beta SP
</I>&gt;<i> camcorder.  The photog remarked how good it looked, and compared it
</I>&gt;<i> favorably with his BetaSP footage.
</I>
Sorry, I don't believe this.

What I can believe is some news stringer might have said such a thing. Do
you know what the pay scale is for broadcast journalism? I've met plenty of
these guys I would not let touch my camera. I've also heaped praise a bit
unwarranted on amateurs to encourage those who show enthusiasm and promise.

&gt;<i> On the other hand... the content of the footage, and how well it's shot will
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes render irrelevant what the footage was shot with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Stuff I shot in 1997 with the same Hi8 Sony at a 5,000 acre night-time fire
</I>&gt;<i> went to most major broadcast and cable networks.
</I>
The 1963 Zapruder film gets airtime to this day, but this is no case for
general use of Standard 8mm film cameras as a primary acquisition format.

I don't doubt you have done great things with Hi8 -- but the credit is
yours, no thanks to the video format. A definitive shot of an important
event beats technically excellent missed opportunities any day. Or as Mark
Twain said about using the right word at the right time, &quot;It's the
difference between lightening and a lightening bug.&quot;

A compelling story is a compelling story. Nobody asks make and model of
cameras which caught airplanes hitting towers on 9-11.

This thread started as an inquiry about blowing DV to 35mm for theatrical
release, and degraded to limitations of DV from there. I stand by my
recommendation of 3-CCD video cameras for serious work.

BTW - in a strange way, I agree with the premise of 1-CCD cameras being
theoretically superior to 3-CCD cameras. Absence of an optical block, for
one thing, and compatibility with standard still &amp; motion picture camera
lenses, which can save thousands of dollars on optics. Perhaps someday the
megapixel imager madness being funded by digital still camera R&amp;D will
evolve into a low cost single-chip video design that is superior to any
3-CCD alternative*.

Even if one of the currently proposed HD video formats sticks as an
exhibition medium, I hope to someday see that acquisition resolution is a
multiple of the distribution format. Perhaps the new Foveon imager or
something like it will play a role. Just as HD cameras of today produce
superior SD NTSC, I think there is big benefit in acquisition and post at
higher resolutions.

*On a practical level today, the Canon Optura consumer 1-CCD video camera
has an imager of higher resolution than NTSC, and downsamples in camera
before recording to DV... this concept could get very interesting, in
competition with conventional 3-CCD, or if it evolves into HD recording. It
might also be useful for improved combo 16:9 and 4:3 performance in a single
camera, useful digital zooming, etc.
