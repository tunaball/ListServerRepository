<PRE>My response was meant to say &quot;Do you really think Apple is going to 
sell an OS 9 compatible package in 2003?&quot; rather than sarcastic against 
Sean.

But I'm glad I inspired such an eloquent case for the continued use of 
OS 9. Now you've got me thinking that the new lower priced 15&quot; GHz 
SuperDrive TiBook might be the last great PowerBook Apple will ever 
make. Seriously.

I know about the problems you explain so well. But I allow myself to 
forgetaboutthem under Steve's Reality Distortion Field.

You are right and welcome to remind us of these horrific and unattended 
to realities Bobbo. Apple is in much to big a hurry to sell OS X than 
they are willing to devote resources to help important big and small 
third parties solve their compatibility challenges.

</I>&gt;<i> throats may be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize no one is forcing me to use X... at least until I buy a new

</I>&gt;<i> an option I'll weigh and consider when that time comes. In the

</I>&gt;<i> new Powerbook 1Gig boots up nicely in 9 or I would not have bought it,
