Since upgrading to X, my ATI XClaim card is now impotent :-( Ahh the 
price of progress). I still use it for a 2nd monitor but my real use 
was to import analogue video in BOTH NTSC AND PAL, the TV feature was 
kinda cool though.

I know, times have changed, if I want to import NTSC I can just pass it 
through my DV camcorder but I still have a need for PAL (parents in UK, 
young child etc... etc..).
Does anyone have any input on which of the following work or any other 
options, obviously if I am going to shell out $200-400 in hardware, 
some advantages over just the 'pass through' option would make me feel 
better justified. I also need (occasionally) to import/convert audio 
only through a small mixer board. My current setup is Jaguar on a 
G4/400 sawtooth which has a Mic jack so this is more of a required 
option if I upgrade.
I have stayed away from the USB (cheap options) because I assume 
quality is going to be an issue (I just ordered a DVD burner).

I have looked at the following but not in great detail, if your are a 
user and/or can offer advice, I would appreciate hearing it on/off list 
is fine.

Canopus ADVC-50 @$200
PAL&amp;NTSC, DV in/out, analogue in (Out?) S video, composite (Out?) audio 
locked. internal and external mounting.
ADS Pyro A/V link @ $250
Seems to be similar spec as above but in external only box
Syncrotech DAC-100 @ $275
Canopus ADVC-100 @$300
Seems like the pro/sumer version of the 50 but an external only box
Formac studio DVTV @ $400
This is the only one I found with a TV tuner  option, but is also the 
most expensive, the non TV is $289. Specs seem comparable with the 
other models mentioned ?

I know I have missed a couple, the sony DVMC-DA2 is NTSC only, the 
Dazzle DV bridge? well feels/looks kinda 'Chintzy'?

What do You think?
Is an external box on the desktop with easy access to cables the way to 
go? The Formac looks cool, which is the best bang for the buck? The 
Canopus with locked audio? I Dunno :-)
