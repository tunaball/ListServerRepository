<PRE>DVCAM/MiniDV has a data rate of  25 Mbps, or just over 8 MB/sec at 
about a 5:1 compression ratio. The spec of DVCAM is equal or superior 
to Betacam in every important category, according to the SMPTE.  High 
definition MPEG 2 (which the prototyped JVC High Def DV uses to record) 
is spec'd by broadcasters at 19.4 Mbits/sec, which implies tremendous 
compression, perhaps 30:1. Basically, DVCAM and MiniDV should visually 
wipe the floor in terms of picture quality with JVC's consumer high def 
in terms of compression artifact degradation.

The JVC High Def DV uses a special (unto JVC alone) recording process 
because it is recording highly compressed MPEG-2 high definition video 
onto the MiniDV tape. The fact that it is so compressed will allow 
ordinary Firewire and ordinary hard drives to handle the content. This 
is not broadcast quality high def by an stretch of the imagination. The 
inevitable presence of compression artifacts will also make this 
consumer high def useless for esoteric things like transfer to film. 
It's one thing to blow up clean video, and quite another to blow up 
uncorrectable compression artifacts. SDI video on DVCAM would look soft 
due to the tremendous up-resolution required, but the JVC consumer HD 
will shout its compressed origins under such conditions.

The BIG question will be -- how will this JVC oddity fare in post 
production? MPEG - anything has always been intended solely as a 
distribution (after the Final Cut - pun intended) medium, and has never 
been consider a viable editorial medium EXCEPT for online compressed 
streaming content purposes.

However, given the fact that a large segment of the television viewing 
public apparently enjoys highly compressed, horribly artifact laden 
(wherein a movie like &quot;The Others&quot; has dozens of unintended additional 
apparitions), the puzzlement becomes - as the viewing public accepts 
lower quality for quantity, will an independent producer be able to 
take advantage of this odd JVC concoction without the public taking 
notice? The near term novelty of HD TV might fuel this possibility as 
well...
