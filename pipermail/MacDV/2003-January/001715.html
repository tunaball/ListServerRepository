<PRE>The beige G3 will accept a plug-in Firewire and/or USB card and work 
just fine.  The PCI architecture used on that machine's motherboard is 
version 2 of the standard.  My wife has a 300 MHz. model.  It has 
extended the useful life of that machine another year or so.  I've even 
tried capturing video on it, using a second Maxtor 60 GB hard drive set 
up as a slave to the original, smaller hard drive (6 GB, I think). 
Works great.  No dropped frames in either capturing or printing to video.

Older Macs, such as the 7100/7200/7500, 8500/8600, and 9500/9600 models 
also had PCI architecture, but they were built to version 1 specs.  They 
will not work with a Firewire/USB card.  You can install the card, but 
the system will not be able to see it and the drivers won't work.
