<PRE>Kathy,
Apple already announced that this is their plan to appease folk like 
yourself last Fall. I am dead sure about the model. So far they have 
only committed til June to continue to offer it that way. Have you 
written Steve Jobs of your concerns yet?

Since what you want to keep using OS 9 for is available in OS X, you 
are going to have a difficult time getting much sympathy from him. But 
I'm sure he'd like to know you think the Cubase for OS X is less stable 
than Cubase for OS 9. Can't you run Cubase for OS 9 in Classic mode or 
not?
