<PRE>This is all simple and kind of off topic. QUIT whining! If you have an 
8600, this monitor couldn't be used anyway. If you are doing audio 
production and your machine works, why do you care about the new stuff. 
Just like the rest of us, when you save up the money or deem it 
necessary to upgrade do it. IIRC, ALL Apple computers will use a CRT 
with no problem! Apple has taken a group of very nice displays and 
priced them so that many MORE people can actually get one without 
giving up the family vacation. Please let this die and GET OVER IT. 
Your Mac works like it is and there is plenty of time to become 
&quot;modern!&quot;
