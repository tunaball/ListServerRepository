<PRE>I never said Jaguar was a fix. I said that 10.1 was not the greatest. 
Compare it to the auto industry. The first year run of a new model line 
is generally plagued with lots of design problems that are fixed in the 
second and third year. Do you expect Ford or GM to trade even for a 
redesigned model? They fix the problems that are deemed dangerous. 
That's it. I think there should have been an upgrade price, but I'm not 
going to beat my chest over $30 or $40. It's still far better than 
anything out of Microsnot. And yes, I do work with Windoze at the 
office. It makes me appreciate what we have with Apple.
