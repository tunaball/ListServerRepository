Yeah, I knew that, really!  But I'm eagerly awaiting the delivery of 
my iLife discs (released this Saturday), so just got my wires crossed.

I do that now. But I shot 6 hours of tourist video in Europe last 
May-June, and after cataloging it with CatDV, I discovered that there 
were several instances where a momentary gap caused the time code to 
reset. I think the primary cause was turning off the camcorder, and 
then later turning it on without checking the queue position on the 
tape. I plan on editing this video to create a DVD (I'll be leaving 
out a lot, of course), and I've been thinking about getting FCE to 
edit it with instead of using iMovie.

&gt;<i>Alternately, you can go for a digital dub (assuming you have two
</I>&gt;<i>cameras or a deck) of that reel's contents so that the dub will have a
</I>&gt;<i>new set of time code on it that FCP can consistently relate to.
</I>
Probably more trouble than it's worth (especially since I have only 
one camcorder handy). I think I would just treat the gap as the 
beginning of a new source tape, as far as FCE is concerned.

So I take it this means that I can retain the original tapes, and 
just archive the project file? Then at a later date I could recreate 
the FCE project by using the Project Capture function with the 
archived project file and the original tapes. That would be cool if 
it works.
