<PRE>Kunga--

It wasn't attributable until you you attributed it.  :-)

If your original quote had said something like &quot;ThinkSecret reported 
that...&quot; or &quot;A reputable news site reported that...&quot;, I probably 
wouldn't have responded. When I know something about the source, I 
know how much credibility to assign to the information.

The reliability of &quot;unnamed sources&quot; can be kinda spotty. I always 
take such information with a grain of salt. As an example, here is 
the last paragraph from the ThinkSecret archive for January 3, 
reporting about the upcoming expo:
&gt;<i>Laptops and Power Macs will also not get a makeover, sources 
</I>&gt;<i>confirm. Most speculation was that iBooks and PowerBooks would not 
</I>&gt;<i>see upgrades, as they were just upgraded this past November. 
</I>&gt;<i>However, Apple is expected to update the Power Mac line, like the 
</I>&gt;<i>iMacs, in late January or early February.
</I>That contains a mix of incorrect and correct information coming from 
unnamed sources. I never take that sort of thing as gospel.

Your iLife pricing information may, in fact, be correct. But I 
wouldn't state it without some qualification.

But thanks for alerting me to the ThinkSecret site. It looks like a 
handy source of information and speculation, and I've added it to my 
list of Mac news sites to check frequently.
