Hello Everyone,
I am a big time Apple fan.  Fan of their products- not politics.  I purchased an Apple
computer that included lifetime support.  Apple decided to just cut it off.  A
class-action lawsuit was brought against Apple and now my lifetime support on that
computer is back.  It took awhile, and I wonder in the meantime how many people bought
new machines, thus eliminating Apple's need to provide the support?  I am not going to
tell you anything you don't know, but just repeating the way I see it.  Apple is in the
business of selling computers.  Whatever they can do to get you to buy a new computer is
what they will do.  Firewire, iMovie, iTunes, iPod, iDVD then iDVD2.  Granted, the newer
computer are able to do more- and I like improvements, so there is a certain amount of
antiquity being built into the machines, but I believe that iDVD could be written for G3s
on OS9. Apple makes their OSX only products.  It might not have rendering in the
background, but it would work. Adobe's new products are both OS9 and OSX.  It can be
done.  Apple is selling software now, too.  Some people think that is their new
direction.  I think they are just beginning to see the added money to be made from it.  I
think their focus is still- sell computers.  As long as they make what I believe to be
the best, most stable, user friendly machines available- I will be a happy owner.
Just nickel's worth
