<PRE>Bobbo is coming from a from the need for a very specific and esoteric 
set of audio applications in his professional audio production business 
environment. He is correct in believing that Apple hasn't done enough 
for his very small but important market segment to safely make the 
transition to OSX with all of his expensive hardware and software 
investment left in tact and fully operational as it still is if he 
keeps using OS 9.

Mike is correct too. The problem is that Apple has to keep innovating 
its system software while it also trys to manage the very complex 
transition from the legacy OS 9 to the modern OS X while also trying to 
help developers do the dame for applications. Some developers simply 
can't afford the cost of the transition and Apple can't help them all 
get through it for a market that may be as small as the one Bobbo is a 
part of. The audio and music market is highly visible and very 
important. But it's not as big as many of the other markets that Apple 
has had to deal with so far in these transition years 2000-2004.

Audio and music parts of OS X are just now getting documented for 
developers.

I'm hoping that Apple's acquisition of eMagic will help divert more of 
Apple's attention and resources to this market segment.
