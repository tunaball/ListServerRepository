<PRE>  Mark ,
Thanks very much for that very timely warning.  It was seeming likely 
that I would have had to buy the Western Digital model.
And Richard, thanks too for clearing up the difference in Maxtor drive models:

&gt;<i>One important note, their are Maxtor MaxLine drives, which are much
</I>&gt;<i>higher specification than all other Maxtor IDE drives,
</I>
STOP PRESS:  the potentially significant news is that yesterday I 
heard that Apple has just announced that, in March, it will put on 
the market a 200gig FW drive, designed especially to be suitable for 
digital video users.   I understand that it is using a new type of 
*bridge*  (whatever that is I don't know) called either Oxford or 
Cambridge -- I don't remember which.  I have an URL to refer to but 
it is at work.   I will post it to the list, probably tomorrow.  No 
mention of price though.

I am currently using a NewMotion 40gig FW drive with OS 9.2.2 and 
Adobe Premier 6.5.2 and apart from the fact that it is too small,  I 
can capture to it and render and export from it successfully.   Even 
real time previews work if I don't ask for too much at once.

Bythe way, during the earlier part of last year, Macformat had a 
couple of surveys of such external drives including Western Dig. 
the 80gig one came out top.

I imagine it should do.


&gt;<i>It will export the  stills I have embedded in the show but not the

</I>&gt;<i>Bad drive?  I'm going to return it as soon as I get my movie and media
</I>&gt;<i>off it.  I hope QT isn't the best I can do.
