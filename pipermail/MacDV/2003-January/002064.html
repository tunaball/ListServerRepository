What's not true? So it kinda works on some other systems. Apple does 
not want to provide support for the monitor on those systems due to the 
known problems, not to mention there may be many other problems that 
come up. That's the difference between supported and not. Apple is 
selling the monitor stating what systems they will support it on. As 
with any other piece of equipment, it may work for uses outside those 
supported, but you are on your own to do the research and take the 
chance.

Just like its a half truth to say you can't drive a screw with a 
hammer. Who wants to be responsible for the potential mess? Not Apple.

And any time they state that something works, even partially, they 
become obligated to support it.

Just trying to provide a different view. I seem to be the official 
&quot;Apple Cheerleader&quot; today.
