<PRE>on 1/29/03 3:45 PM, Thubten Kunga &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/macdv.html">Kunga at FutureMedia.org</A>&gt; dropped through
the skylight and said:

&gt;<i> I have a Canon XL-1 and I was disappointed in its performance (lousy in
</I>&gt;<i> low light). I do like the improved feature set of the Canon XL-1S
</I>&gt;<i> though. I have heard (not experienced because I do all my transfers
</I>&gt;<i> with a deck) of incompatibilities with Canon cameras in transferring
</I>&gt;<i> video.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been using Sony cameras ever since the early 90's with no
</I>&gt;<i> problems to speak of. I think that if you are choosing between those
</I>&gt;<i> brands at the lower price points that Sony is better. It's really
</I>&gt;<i> personal bias. I like Sony. All my TVs are Sony because the are the
</I>&gt;<i> only ones that have the brains to allow audio swap between small and
</I>&gt;<i> large PIP windows. And I believe in the Trinitron CRT as a superior way
</I>&gt;<i> to display TV. So the Sony brand loyalty bias goes way beyond which is
</I>&gt;<i> a better camera.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure there are some on this list that swear by Canon. Perhaps they
</I>&gt;<i> should come forward to balance out this &quot;debate&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> k
</I>
Okay, here's a viewpoint from a &quot;lower-end&quot; Canon user. I got a ZR25 for
Christmas 2 years ago and have been pretty satisfied with it. For basic
&quot;home movie&quot; type shooting (i.e. holidays, kids' sports events, vacations,
special occasions, etc.) it's done a pretty good job. I've never had any
capture issues with it (500mhz iMac G3 DV SE &amp; iMovie 2.0 --&gt; 2.1.1). I love
the size of it. Recently spent 2 weeks in Orlando and often had it in one
hand, and my Olympus C720 still camera in the other... yes, a double-fisted
shooter!

The image stabilizer feature seems to work fairly well. At least I've had no
complaints yet.  For the price range, Canon's single-CCD camcorders seem
like a good value for many consumer-level shooters.

On the other hand, I have no cause to disparage Sony products. I've had a
Sony TV for a couple years now, and have been extremely pleased with it. I
would definitely consider Sony electronics when looking to purchase again.
