<PRE>Got a 10 gig for Christmas. Love it! The earbuds went the first day. 
Guess my ears are too small, but they are just plain uncomfortable. 
Gave the case to a friend, as I don't do belt clips. I'm using an iSkin 
case for it with a Marware neck lanyard. Haven't tested the length of 
charge, but I don't think the charge indicator is terribly accurate. 
Controls are very easy to use. Gets very warm while charging. Have it 
less than half full, and there are over 700 tracks on it. This includes 
a large number of 1 and 2 hour tracks and a couple of 9 hour audiobooks 
that are broken into 45 minute segments. Also have it synced to iCal 
and Address book. That's nice for those who don't have a PDA. After 
struggling with a USB MP3 player, it's beautiful to be able to upload a 
new album in a matter of seconds instead of 20 or 30 minutes. Only way 
to go. Friend of mine was playing with it the other day and he asked me 
to PLEASE not show it to his wife. She'll want one, too. My favorite 
toy.
