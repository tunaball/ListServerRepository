<PRE>Kunga,

&gt;<i> Yes DVDSP works with external DVD-R drives.
</I>
Thanks for your reply.

If you mean *any* external DVD-R drive, including my CenDyne (Pioneer)
DVR-105 / TT-345U2F combo, and not just certain *supported* DVD-R
drives, that is welcomed news. This is the problem I ran into with
Retrospect.

&gt;<i> But for less than that
</I>&gt;<i> $1,000, you can sell your TiBook 800 and buy the GHz 12&quot; APB
</I>SuperDrive
&gt;<i> for $2,000 or the 15&quot; TiPB for $2800 and get to use iDVD3 with it.
</I>
I'm sure iDVD3 would be OK for awhile, but I do video professionally &amp;
think I'll want the additional features of DVDSP in the near future
anyway. I might as well start the learning process for that app.
sooner than later.

&gt;<i> This route will probably only cost you a few hundred dollars to
</I>&gt;<i> graduate to the 15&quot; SuperDrive TiPB.
</I>
A few hundred here, a few hundred there, what's the big deal? ;-)  All
this buying (and/or selling) really isn't what I want to be doing. I
spent more than I really wanted to in the first place. Now I'm
supposed to take a hit on my &quot;old&quot; PB *&amp;* pay a few hundred more to do
something that, IMO, I should be able to do now anyway? I see your
point but I don't think I'm going in that direction.

I haven't yet begun to regret my fairly pricey &quot;Switch&quot;, but I've got
to say I never expected it to be the money hole it's turned out to be.
When all is said &amp; done, I just want to be able to use FCP to edit my
video, then output to DVD-R using the above mentioned FW DVD-RW. If I
need DVDSP to do that, so be it. Above &amp; beyond that, I'm not sure
what I'm going to be able to do without, what seems to me, more
expense &amp; hassle than the PC counterpart. Just the early opinion of a
fairly new (&amp; somewhat frustrated) Mac owner.

&gt;<i> Plus you'll be faster and won't
</I>&gt;<i> have to be asking these questions about Retrospect Express.
</I>
Well, maybe yes, maybe no. I haven't heard that the 1Gig TiG4 is that
much faster, if any, than the 800MHz machine. Ultimately, I might be
better off with the DVR-105 (not *yet* supported in Retrospect) for
the purpose of burning video DVDs, than going backward to the DVR-104
in the Gig TiPB, as well.

I guess I'll have to step up to the plate &amp; order DVDSP now that I
know it'll work with my hardware. As to my Retrospect problem, if I
can't find a way to make it work with my DVD-RW, I'll just have to get
a bunch of CD-RWs &amp; use the combo drive that's built into the TiG4 &amp;
supported in this app. until Dantz upgrades the list of supported
drives.

Life goes on ...

Take care,

Frank Wiewandt
