<PRE>Previous posts lead me to believe that if you care about your code 
numbers an logging, you can forget about FCE. If you have a reel with 
multiple zeros due to unrecorded gaps, someone else fill in the answer 
please. I'm inexperienced with that problem. I think FCP doesn't know 
where to go beyond the first gapless part. Somebody else knows right?

In future, try to make a point of not rewinding tape you are shooting 
or always be careful about the cue if you do. Always tape a few seconds 
beyond the shot you want to allow yourself some resume space if you 
plane on rewinding and reviewing a shot before taking the next one.

Alternately, you can go for a digital dub (assuming you have two 
cameras or a deck) of that reel's contents so that the dub will have a 
new set of time code on it that FCP can consistently relate to.But any 
dub may have dropouts, just like any original may have drop outs except 
maybe more.

Tape is inherently fragile and drop out prone. It doesn't usually 
happen. But it does happen from time to time.
