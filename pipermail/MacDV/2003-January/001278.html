<PRE>You must be the kind of customer they dream of, one born every minute.  
Using analogy then if I bought a car that broke down every other day it 
might be safe but I would should not expect it to be fixed?  If they 
told me that my car was still being developed when I bought and that if 
I were to only BUY these additional parts it would work just as it was 
advertised to in first place would you expect me to be happy?  You may 
be a happy Yugo driver but I certainly would be p*%% off.

The iDVD program not recognizing outside the box DVD-R drives is 
another Apple policy that rubs me the wrong way (though not affecting 
me since I have a superdrive) and in my opinion is a money grab by 
Apple at the expense of their loyal followers.  It has made many 
perfectly fine machines obsolete for no really good reason.  I know 
someone will pipe in with the licensing issue but they charge for iDVD 
so just charge a little more and pay for the darn license.
