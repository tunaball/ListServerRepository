<PRE>You can still run your 9 apps in Classic mode which is often times 
faster than running them natively Kathy. Do you know for sure that what 
you think you &quot;need&quot; isn't available in X or doesn't run perfectly in 
Classic mode? What apps?

You can't do the 9 native boot in the 2003 Macs because Apple is making 
the ROM non-native 9 insistent. It won't matter what you do with the 
hard drive. It still won't boot into 9. However Apple is going to 
continue to offer the dual 1.25 GHz MDD with native 9 booting 
capability &#8212; maybe at a lower price than now since that speed will 
become the middle model when the next refresh is released. It will be 
the fastest last OS 9 native booting Mac. Maybe it'll have some 2003 
features like FW800. Who knows? Steve.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I'm trying to wait until the new towers are announced so

</I>&gt;<i> can scoop up the current 1ghz model at a much lower price - and the
