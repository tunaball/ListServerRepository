<PRE>If you want an archival copy of the movie, miniDV tape or a highest-quality
DV file on a disc would retain the best quality. What I've been doing
recently is to backup the iMovie and iDVD projects and associated media
files to a set of DATA DVDs.
Printable TDK DVD-Rs can be purchased on 100-disc spindles at CostCo for a
bit over $30, which works out to a bit over $0.30 per disc, so it can be
more time- and cost-effective than backing up to miniDV tape. I'm not sure
about the lifetime of the media, though.
