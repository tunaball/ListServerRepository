I would have to disagree with you on these points.

Firstly, I believe the original poster was talking about outputting the
final video sequence to DV tape. This is not a file - it is linear digital
video. You can access and capture any part of it (albeit much slower than a
hard drive) a number of ways. The easiest would be to do a batch capture in
something like Final Cut Pro or Premiere, where you can simply input the
time codes of the clips you want (TC is on the DV tape) and they will
automatically shuttle the DV machine to the appropriate points to capture.
Alternatively, you can manually shuttle to the desired points and capture
them in iMovie or other programs that don't deal with time code.

While tape has it's issues (degradation over time), for long term archival
storage it is far superior to a hard drive. All it takes to lose a file on a
hard drive is to have a head crash (slight bumps at the wrong time), have
the directory or a file corrupted, or sometimes the drive just stop
spinning. I have a box full of dead drives that have bitten the dust over
the years, and with most of them there were no early warning signs. Hence
the absolute requirement to always have a complete backup.

Let's say you had a single 12 GB file that held the complete contents of a
one hour DV tape. One flaw in that data file and everything is gone. If you
get a dropout or two on the DV tape, the media before and after it is still
good and you can still salvage the rest of it.

Ultimately no matter what format you choose, it's wise to have a regular
backup strategy and also have a plan to move your archives to new forms of
media as they come into play. At least with digital stuff, you're not losing
quality as you do this.

For what it's worth, my suggestion would be to keep the stuff on DV tape,
get a Blu-Ray burner and make two copies of everything that is important
enough to back up, keeping one copy at a separate physical location. Save
the hard drives for shorter term works in progress.
