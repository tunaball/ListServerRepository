<PRE>After reading all of this thread I am left with a question. When I  
finish an edit in iMovie I export it
to the camcorder mini dv tape. From that tape I can make VHS or DVD. I  
have always selected
the &quot;Render and Proceed&quot; in the process. Do I understand that this is  
not a preferred choice, or
dose it only apply to using iDVD?
