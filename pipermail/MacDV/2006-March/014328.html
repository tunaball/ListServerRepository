<PRE>Your best bet would be to take the audio and make a .mp3 file out of it. 

You have two ways of accomplishing this. 

First, for both options, you export the audio from iMovie as a QuickTime 
movie. You will have to put a single frame of video on the iMovie track to 
export it. I usually put a still image from iPhoto on the video line to 
accomplish this. Then, you go into QuickTime, extract the audio track and 
save it as an .aiff file. 

OPTION 1: iTunes 

Drag that file into iTunes. Open up your preferences and choose the Advanced 
button, then the Import button. Select the Use .mp3 encoder and choose the 
Higher (192 Kpbs) setting if you want the best audio. If the track is of 
someone speaking, you could choose a lower setting. Choose Custom under the 
Setting below the .mp3 encoder and choose 96 Kbps. This will give you an 
acceptable sounding file, plus make the file size smaller. 

Then, go to your iTunes Library and make sure the check boxes next to all of 
the items in the Library are off EXCEPT for the one by the .aiff file you 
have drug in (it may be at the bottom of the list, depending on its name). 
Then, hit the Import button in the upper right and the file will be 
converted to a .mp3 selection and stored in the Music folder on your Mac in 
the iTunes Library folder. You can then take the .mp3 file and give it to 
the folks who are wanting it for the Web. 

OPTION 2: QuickTime Itself 

This option is easier, but you have fewer controls over your .mp3. After you 
extract the audio track, you select Export under the File menu and you 
choose Movie to MPEG Audio Layer 3. This also creates a .mp3 file from your 
audio track; however, you will have to accept the default settings in 
QuickTime for the export (which I think is 128 Kbps). That will also give an 
acceptable .mp3 file, but it would be larger than the 96 Kbps file in iTunes 
we discussed earlier. This may work for the Web folks, but they usually like 
smaller audio and video files since many people still have a dial-up 
connection to the Internet. 

If I haven't been clear on anything, please e-mail back and I'll try to 
straighten up any confusion.

Hi, 

Sorry if this seems a bit away from the normal stuff discussed on the list, 
but I am looking for advice on something. I video recorded a charity show 
last Sunday at which there was an opening monologue which ran for about 
20mins. A number of people have asked if the audio part of the recording can 
be extracted and used on the web. I know how to extract the audio, but I am 
not sure what way to format the audio for use on the web. 

I will be using QuickTime to do this. I know the audio file needs to be as 
small as possible without losing so much quality that is can not be 
understood. First thing I guess is to convert it from stereo to mono, next 
what format is best for the web... wav, mpg, aiff..... ??? 

What settings do you suggest I should use in the 'Sound Settings' options. 

Any advice would be welcomed as this is my first time to use a recoding for 
the web.
