<PRE>Two years ago, I started a community video project, which I finally
completed this last January.  At the time we started, we were unsure
whether we would circultae the final product in VHS, dvd, or both.  By
the time we got to the end of the project, it seemed clear for a number
of reasons that we would put it out only on dvd, even though a few
people had told us they didn't own dvd players and wanted VHS tapes.  My
sense is that they somehow managed to get hold of dvd players.  Anyway,
we didn't offer VHS tapes, and there have been no complaints.

I'm about to start another, similar 2+ year project, and I'm asking the
same question.  Two years from now, what should we think of the final
format being?

In this case, I'm wondering about HDTV dvds -- which would entail buying
an HD middv camcorder. I'm very pleased with my Sony TRV 900, and would
want the equivalent.  What is the HD equivalent, and approximately what
would it cost?   And will an HD dvd play in non-HD players?

I'm also curous about double-layer dvds and dvd burners.  Forgive my
ignorance, but will they play on ordinary dvd players?  I have a Pioneer
105 in my GF dual.  What might I replace it with to burn double-layer
dvds, and what would it cost?

The overriding question is, in the crystal ball, will it make sense to
commit to HDTV now, for something put out in 2007 (and hopefully used
obver subsequent years)?

Judgments?  Opinions?

BobLL
