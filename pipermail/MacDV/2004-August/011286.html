&gt;<i> After 18 months and hundreds of hours of preparation, interviews, 
</I>&gt;<i> etc., I'm finally editing a community video in FCE. Some accumulated 
</I>&gt;<i> problems I'd really welcome help on:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Some interviews, with multiple people, were recorded with a 
</I>&gt;<i> boundary mike which produces mono sound on one track only. They sound 
</I>&gt;<i> weak when I project them, since they come from only one speaker. Is 
</I>&gt;<i> there any way to get that sound onto the second stereo track, so we 
</I>&gt;<i> keep stereo sound throughout? I tried copy and paste one track onto 
</I>&gt;<i> the other in the time line, but it doesn't work. I have a couple of 
</I>&gt;<i> sound editing programs (Peak and Amadeus II), but I haven't used them 
</I>&gt;<i> much, nor do I know how to connect them to FCE sound track. Can you 
</I>&gt;<i> help me with this?
</I>Perhaps the audio is panned to the left channel.  try changing the 
audio pan on the cloned audio clip.  Triple and quadrupling the number 
of tracks might create a more robust sound.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. When fading between scenes of the same still shot to successively 
</I>&gt;<i> brighter levels, during the fade the level goes up to beyond the level 
</I>&gt;<i> of second scene than drops back down (in a fraction of a second). Is 
</I>&gt;<i> there any way to get a smooth ramp up to the second level, with no 
</I>&gt;<i> drop back? I've explored the cross fade control windows with no 
</I>&gt;<i> success. I finally used a dithered cross fade which makes the drop 
</I>&gt;<i> back less obvious, but I'd prefer a straight, smooth cross fade.
</I>Are you selecting cross dissolve?  Sounds like you are trying an 
additive dissolve.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. In some interviews, the light level fades in and out, I'm guessing 
</I>&gt;<i> because of some auto level response on the camcorder which I didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> notice at the time. Can this be corrected in the editing process?
</I>Not very well.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Some of the sound bites start abruptly (in order to get rid of 
</I>&gt;<i> previous sound fragments). Can I add a space of silence before the 
</I>&gt;<i> sound starts? How? Is there a way to fake ambient sound?
</I>Go back to the same location and record ambient sound.  It will most 
likely sound very similar.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6. The quality of some of the still shots (from slides), which look 
</I>&gt;<i> fine on the computer monitor, look lousy on the video monitor. But 
</I>&gt;<i> some of them look terrific, which baffles me. I have struggled with 
</I>&gt;<i> taking them into and out of Photoshop with no consistent results. Most 
</I>&gt;<i> of them have been processed by PhotoWorks, who send them back on disc 
</I>&gt;<i> in three different resolutions -- 384x256 pixels, 768x512 pixels and 
</I>&gt;<i> 1536x1024 pixels. I have been using the middle range, which seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> offer the best results, but still often not great on the video 
</I>&gt;<i> monitor. How can I improve the quality of the poor ones -- which look 
</I>&gt;<i> just fine on the computer monitor in FCE and Photoshop? They are all 
</I>&gt;<i> jpeg images. Is there some standard procedure for maximizing the 
</I>&gt;<i> quality of slides inserted into a FCE? This is a big problem for me 
</I>&gt;<i> because the slides are a very important part of the message of this 
</I>&gt;<i> project. It's hard to believe that with all this magical electronic 
</I>&gt;<i> equipment, something better can'tbe made to happen.
</I>You need to ensure that the color is corrected to NTSC standards in 
Photoshop and the broadcast quality standard is set to conservative.  
100-110 ire units.  If the tape is to be telecast over a licensed 
broadcaster the maximum IRE should be 100 and minimum 7.5.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I make a tape and play it through a TV set, the images look a 
</I>&gt;<i> little bit better, but the landscapes still look pretty flat and 
</I>&gt;<i> pixellated (is that a word?). What is going to happen if I try to 
</I>&gt;<i> publish on VHS?
</I>A VHS layoff will look even worse.  Colors muddied by lack of NTSC 
compatibility,  inattention to signal quality, and stills that don't 
move all make for a pretty crappy signal.  (768x512 is not a size that 
lends itself well to panning and scaling)  Images that were 500 lines 
are reduced to 240 lines or less.  Dubs from the VHS master or 
transfers to a cable systems server will result in further bleeding of 
color and a symptom called cartoon effect which blends slight color 
differences into a single flat color.

But then some clown will just say.  &quot;well, its just access television&quot;
