That actually solved your problems? Did you create a new user with 
administrative privileges?

I bought my Mac from Online Micro LLC. As far as I know, the 512Mb it 
came with was installed by Apple. I also have 2Gb worth of second party 
RAM. I tried authoring/burning my project with just the 512Mb installed 
(I removed my 2nd party RAM), but that didn't make any difference. I 
tried for an entire day with just the original 512Mb, and it didn't 
make any difference. I've run diagnostics on all my RAM, and no 
problems are evident.

When I get a chance, I'll take a look at the 256Mb modules. I'm curious 
as to whether they have any Apple branding marks, or indications that 
the retailer may have swapped Apple installed RAM for some second party 
RAM.

I haven't tried burning the project using just the 2nd party RAM.

I'm currently trying to burn just the video. A single menu with a 
'Play' button. I'm also investigating the use of ffmpegx to author and 
burn the video.
