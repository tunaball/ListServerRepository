I did update my QuickTime, I updated it as soon as the update came out, 
but I can't recall whether I attempted to encode/render using iDVD 
after the upgrade.

</I>
I've tried using the Hurz/Pfurz hack with iDVD. All it does is create a 
disk image. You still need to burn the data to a DVD. You can't simply 
copy it to the disc, as that will only create a data disk. The disc 
needs to be burnt in UDF format in order for the DVD to play in a 
stereo component/set-top DVD player.

The Hurz/Pfurz hack didn't help me because my problems were in the 
rendering and encoding phase (Stages 2 &amp; 3), not in the burn phase 
(Stage 4).

&gt;<i> I am curious about this because I have a Dual 2.0 Rev. B and have 
</I>&gt;<i> created about 8 DVD's using iMovie 4.0.1 and iDVD 4.0.1 without 
</I>&gt;<i> experiencing any sort of the problems you report.
</I>
My Mac is a Dual 1.8Ghz model. I'm thinking that the codec that iDVD 
was using was compiled on a machine with a processor different than 
mine (possibly a 2.0 model), and that there were subtle differences in 
the way the code was written/compiled. Subtle enough to cause serious 
problems. Give the number of 1.8Ghz DP users with the same (or similar) 
problem, I wouldn't be surprised if this were true.

I'll post again after I've given iDVD one more try, now that QuickTime 
has been updated.
