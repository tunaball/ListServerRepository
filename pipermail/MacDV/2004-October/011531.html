Gerhard -

I've left it for 20 hours at one time (with power management/screen 
savers off). About 30% of the time it crashes, when it crashes, it 
usually crashes within 30 minutes or so. If it doesn't crash, it 
experiences what I call a &quot;freewheel&quot; symptom. I was recently able to 
complete a burn (of the iDVD tutorial), but the quality was so bad it 
was unusable. The burn that completed took about 5 minutes to complete 
stages 1 - 3, and another 5 minutes to complete stage 4. That project 
had a menu, a transition, motion graphics, some music, and 5 seconds 
worth of video.

I'm begining to think that the codec used by iDVD for video/audio 
rendering and encoding is not compatible with my processor. ffmpegx 
uses two different codec's. I've been trying both, with limited 
success.

I'm still tinkering with ffmpegx. I have suceeded in producing a 
VIDEO_TS folder with the components required for a DVD burn. 
Unfortunately, there's no aduio yet. I'm going to try to produce the 
audio and video separately, and then mux them together using one of 
ffmpegx's post processing capabilities.
