<PRE>I went through almost all of the problems you describe.

The last step Apple tech strolled me through was creating a new user,
logging in under that user and trying again, that worked, but then 
problems again.

Following this thread carefully , I think your problem is the same as 
mine:  BAD RAM!!!!

The &quot;free&quot; 512 RAM upgrade I got with my G5 Dual 2.5, turned out to be 
faulty.

Now. when they determined this at the local Apple dealer, they didn't 
have replacement RAM so I took

it back to my studio and I have been burning DVD's out of iMovie up to 
60 minutes long (for my cable access

TV show &quot;I'm Not Fishing&quot;)  flawlessly  since.  I also run about 30 
hours of  very involved ProTools sessions weekly.

ALL WITH ONLY 512 MEGS OF RAM !!!!

I was gettin' really bummed with Apple, but it turned out it was the 
crap RAM the reseller put in.

Did you get your machine from a reseller with a RAM upgrade???

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For that matter to say that you can't use MPEG files in an iDVD

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is a very strange statement. Considering the fact that QuickTime 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> video
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> files (.mov extension) are based on MPEG standards.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding your problems using iDVD:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Upgrade to the latest version of iMovie if you haven't done so, yet.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Restart, then:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did that, it doesn't seem to have helped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As another poster suggested... and I'll modify here slightly:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Try using a short piece of original video you've captured into iMovie 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the conventional way from a camcorder, so you know that you're 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting the proper file format into iMovie in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, but that is not possible. The original video came from a VHS 
</I>&gt;<i> tape. A friend transfered/converted the movie from VHS to DVD (in 
</I>&gt;<i> VIDEO_TS) format. What do you mean by the proper file format? Would 
</I>&gt;<i> iMovie allow me to import an 'improper' file format? That doesn't seem 
</I>&gt;<i> likely. If the video plays fine in iMovie, it should be assumed that 
</I>&gt;<i> this data is 'proper'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pull that clip into the timeline, save the project, then hit the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> button to create a new iDVD project. Quit iMovie.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I took a 2 minute 19 second clip into iMovie, added 4 chapter markers, 
</I>&gt;<i> and created a new iDVD project. Quit iMovie,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Burn a DVD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and attempted a burn using iDVD. After about 15 minutes at stage 2, 
</I>&gt;<i> the burn icon began to spin at an accelerated and constant rate (CPU 
</I>&gt;<i> usage drops dramatically). This is indicative of iDVD giving up, but 
</I>&gt;<i> not throwing up an error message, or crashing. I've seen this behavior 
</I>&gt;<i> many times now. If I allow it to continue the icon will 'freewheel' 
</I>&gt;<i> until I force quit. Cancel and quit have no response.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It shouldn't take very long to find out whether THAT short project 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> burns, and is playable on your Mac and your DVD players.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IF it does, it suggests that the software and hardware are working, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and that there's something in one or more of the elements you've used 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in your &quot;problem&quot; project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ----------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One thing that was suggested either here or on the Apple Discussion 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> boards :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://discussions.info.apple.com/">http://discussions.info.apple.com/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Make sure that you have a SUBSTANTIAL amount of free hard drive space 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on your internal drive, since OS X uses some of your hard drive for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> swap files (what we remember as &quot;virtual memory&quot; on OS 9 and earlier) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the software in use may also do the same thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SUBSTANTIAL was suggested to be as much as or more than 40GIGabytes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've got over 50Gb worth of space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it DOESN'T work, try checking the TS_Video folder's files by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opening it with Apple DVD Player.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If they DO behave as you wanted, try burning the TS_Video and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TS_Audio files to a DVD using Toast.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've yet to get to this point. iDVD fails at stage 2 or 3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've use the last two steps to check and successfully burn a DVD 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Studio Pro 3 project that I was having problems burning from inside 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the DVDSP3 application.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let us know what happens... but in your case, I wouldn't keep trying 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to use the files you've converted or ripped from a DVD using 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software.  I suspect that's part of the problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The files were converted/ripped from VHS using hardware. An analog to 
</I>&gt;<i> digital converter. The DVD created by that process plays fine in my 
</I>&gt;<i> DVD player (Set top player and computer). So, despite the fact that 
</I>&gt;<i> the movie looks good, previews fine, and works in iMovie and iDVD, it 
</I>&gt;<i> might be bad video?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FYI: I attempted to burn the iDVD project on a DP 2.5Ghz G5 at the 
</I>&gt;<i> nearby AppleStore. iDVD crashed three times while I was there. :-(
