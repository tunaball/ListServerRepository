Nick -

Roger that bit regarding the Hurz/Pfurz hack. Just to save me from 
wasting a disc. I was confused.

I tried to burn my iDVD project (using the Hurz/Pfurz hack) after my 
QuickTime upgrade. I am running QuickTime Pro 6.5.2. with the MPEG-2 
plug-in (version 6.4) and iDVD 4.0.1.

After attempting the burn, iDVD got about 15% (about 10 minutes) into 
stage 2 (rendering and encoding menus and transitions) before the burn 
icon began to 'freewheel', spinning at a constant accelerated (compared 
to activity prior to this point) rate with a considerable reduction in 
CPU activity. Up until this point, there was audible activity on my 
computers hard drive. After this point I noted a marked drop in CPU 
activity, virtually no hard drive activity, and a continuous spin rate 
of the burn icon. I continued to wait for 2 hours before force quitting 
iDVD (cancel and quit had no effect).

I had similar results with an attempt to burn the iDVD tutorial.

The QuickTime update made no difference for me. I still think it's the 
codec used by iDVD in order to do the encoding/rendering. I know that a 
codec upgrade was included in the QuickTime upgrade, but I'm not sure 
it's the same codec that's used by iDVD.
