A followup is in order. Since 1st post I have done several things: 1) 
repaired permissions, 2) deleted the iMovie preferences file, 3) 
deleted Final Cut Pro HD (and all other associated applications), 3) 
restarted numerous times with firewire cable plugged in, camera on in 
VTR mode and also the reverse-restart and then turn on camera in VTR 
mode, 4) unplugged and plugged the firewire cable to computer while 
computer is on and when camera is on and off positions. Importing tape 
from camera to computer is fine. iMovie even controls the camera while 
importing. But when I go to export back to tape (share) I still get the 
message about computer has lost it's firewire connection. Since iMovie 
is controlling camera, it seems that communication is taking place in 
both directions. Is there some special type of communication taking 
place when you tell iMovie to share to videocamera? Never had this 
problem before. By the way, this is happening w/both of my cameras-a 
Sony DSR-250 and a Sony DCR-VX2000. Could my firewire ports be the 
problem? Early in  2004, Apple did have to replace my entire 
motherboard. With Applecare, it was no charge. Have successfully 
performed several projects since then. I have a dual G5 2.0 ghz machine 
but only 512k RAM. Could that be the problem? never has in the past. 
Would a CUDA reset help? Thanks for any advice from the pros on this 
board. Otherwise, it is back to Apple.
