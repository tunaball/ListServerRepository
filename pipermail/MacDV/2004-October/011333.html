<PRE>Mark--I appreciate your interest-- I also was really surprised that a 
battery would cause my problems, which were really bad--that is I 
couldn't get anything to work consistently. For example, I first 
noticed problems when I would be working some video project and all of 
sudden iMovie would quit or a transfer of files would stop and the 
computer would freeze. Force quit wouldn't help. Then when I would 
restart, the drives (3) on the SIIG 133 card would not show up. I have 
2   75 G drives on the internal bus and they would always show and the 
external FW drives always came up. As I said earlier I tried my tools 
with no success.

Tech Tool 4 seemed to be working OK but very slowly and finally it quit 
in drive reading process and finally would freeze up and a restart was 
needed. The drives that it would not complete were those on the PCI 
card.  And other utilities didn't seem to help--Then I noticed the 
clock problem and put the battery in. I have had no problems. The 
restart showed all drives and the original startup drive worked fine 
(on the PCI card).

Since then I have done several hours of video importing and sharing 
back to tape (I am in the process of archiving old 8 mm video).

The computer is an eBay purchase of about 18 mos ago. I have never had 
any major problems--none that I couldn't deal with. But I have always 
felt that it was slower than I expected--lots of spinning beach ball.

I have also been concerned about heat build up but until this problem, 
I had not been too concerned. So any other thoughts?
