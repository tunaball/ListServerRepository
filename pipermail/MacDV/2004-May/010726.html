<PRE>Richard:

I've always had problems with Adaptec software drivers and every 
release of OS X.  My solution may not work for you, but it's simple 
enough to try:

     DELETE (or move) the &quot;Adaptec29160x.kext&quot; file from 
System&gt;Library&gt;Extension folder and restart.

I use the Adaptec 2930 card, so I can't speak definitively for other 
cards or devices, but if they share some code base, it might work.

I have 2 older (pre-&quot;New World&quot;) SCSI devices which I still need to 
use: a Castlewood ORB drive and an Imation 8x CD burner.  With OS X 
as-installed, Apple provides the &quot;official&quot; Adaptec released drivers 
for their current cards, in my case, the &quot;Adaptec290X-2930.kext&quot;. 
This driver is DYSFUNCTIONAL with my devices!

With this driver installed, the Imation CD burner will only operate 
as a CD reader, and the ORB drive will not mount unless a disk is 
already inserted at startup.  With the driver removed, both drives 
operate as expected.

With every point release of OS X, the install reinstalls this driver, 
and I have to go delete it again.  The Orb and Imation drives work 
fine with the default generic driver which is also included in every 
OS X release: &quot;Adaptec78XXSCSI.kext&quot;.

The downside is that deep sleep doesn't work without the 2930 specific driver.

</I>&gt;<i>There is definitely an issue here. I can no longer use my DLT tape
</I>&gt;<i>drive for DVD mastering on OS X 10.3.3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My LVD SCSI card from Adaptec only occasionally can be seen by System
</I>&gt;<i>Profiler, but usually not. It is quite NEW, and formerly very robust.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I use quality, active termination, and had 100% success with SCSI prior
</I>&gt;<i>to 10.3.3. Now, if it weren't for an amiable replicator who will
</I>&gt;<i>master, fingers crossed, from media originating on the amateur
</I>&gt;<i>Superdrive DVD-R, I would have body parts missing by way of an
</I>&gt;<i>non-understanding corporate client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I tried reinstalling all drivers, moving the $300+ LVD SCSI card to
</I>&gt;<i>different slots, different cables, different SCSI ID's different
</I>&gt;<i>booting routines... and nothing would bring up this relatively new,
</I>&gt;<i>under 30 hours of use, DLT drive, which passes its own self test every
</I>&gt;<i>time it's booted. It has become a very expensive paperweight. As I need
</I>&gt;<i>to author out of DVD Studio Pro, it is useless moving the thing to a
</I>&gt;<i>machine not doing authoring, as I only have a 10/100 network. All those
</I>&gt;<i>gigs.... Must be direct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Should I find a solution, I will post here.
</I>&gt;<i>
