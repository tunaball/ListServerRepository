If you paid by credit card, claim fraud and stop payment.  If not, you're at
the mercy of the dealer.  Dealer most likely will serve him or herself
first.  In the future, paypal via credit card only.  Get express warranty
terms, and demand terms allowing full payment refund including shipping fees
if anything should be off.  People with integrity will do this because they
stand by the product, but importantly their service and reputation.  If you
buy off ebay especially, you need explicit assurances everywhere and down
the line.

The moment I see a no returns policy, or a return excepting shipping costs,
or that and a restocking fee, when an item is defective...gone.  The logic
seems to be, that yes, they send you crap, but they wouldn't have gone to
the trouble of sending it to you if you hadn't been stupid enough to buy it
under false pretenses.

May such dealers encounter those fine, upstanding soldiers in the news
lately...
