Yes.  That is, if this question is really asking &quot;Should I use iDVD instead
of Toast?&quot;  Toast's DVD encoding was added as more of a convenience to the
user than an actual useable tool (in my opinion) -- I've had all kinds of
&quot;pops&quot; and &quot;glitches&quot; with DVDs created with Toast 6, but never with iDVD.

&gt;<i> Does DVD-R media matter?
</I>
Possibly.  It won't make the image any better, but if your DVD player has
problems reading the disc, it could skip or glitch or be REALLY blocky.  At
least that's been my experience -- I was having playback problems, then I
burned my DVD on a different brand of media and the problems disappeared.

&gt;<i> Do I need to keep a copy of the original on DV Tape for future use (as in
</I>further edit sessions, I do not want or have the room to keep my projects on my
&gt;<i> drive)? 
</I>
As most people on this list would recommend -- lay your edited piece to tape
as well as DVD.  That way if you need to re-import some of the edited stuff,
you have it basically at original quality (since importing DV via FireWire
in itself causes no image degradation at all -- just moving the 1s and 0s).

&gt;<i> Was kinda hoping the the DVD would become the new archive as
</I>&gt;<i> well, but I guess poor image quality and the fact that I do not know
</I>&gt;<i> how to record my DVDs back to my computer makes that a no-go.
</I>
Use the DVDs for playback -- and for copying to give to friends and family.
Almost everyone has a DVD player now (and most play DVD-R discs without
problems), but not everyone has a miniDV camcorder.  If you use iDVD for the
DVD creation, the quality should be quite good, but if you had to re-import
it for some reason, you'd lose a &quot;generation&quot; in the process of re-encoding
the video to DV.

&gt;<i> Oh, my poor little head is just so full of questions &lt;smile&gt;.
</I>
We're all here to help each other.
