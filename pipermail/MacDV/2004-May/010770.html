If you edit the DV and then export back to the DV camcorder you shouldn't
see any loss in quality.  Edit in iMovie, then feed it back to the
camcorder.  Then play the camcorder output to your TV.  The quality should
be at it's best here.

If you are looking at the video in iMovie or in the QuickTime player, the
quality will seem lower.  I think iMovie should look better than the QT
player but if I recall, iMovie doesn't show the video at full quality
either.

To see the full quality in QT player, and assuming you have the Pro version,
open the edited DV in the QT player.  Then go to the menu Movie:Get Movie
Properties.  You'll see a window pop-up with two menus, under the left one
select Video Track, under the right one select Quality.  Then click on &quot;High
Quality Enabled&quot;  The DV should look as good as your monitor can show it.
You might notice lines but that's normal as the DV is interlaced and your
computer display is not.  You can select &quot;Deinterlace Fields&quot; if it's there
or &quot;Single Field&quot; if it's not, it will lose some sharpness on your display
but the lines will go away.

You don't need to save these changes to your DV file, iDVD will always use
the full quality to render the DVD.

Just remember, while DV format looks pretty good to the human eye, it is
already compressed 5 to 1.  Compressing to DVD will compress even further,
depending on how much you need to fit on a disc.
