<PRE>I'd like to thank all of you who emailed me privately with offers to 
test one photo, to see what you could do with them. I've sent you a 
sampling of a few pictures via email. If they don't arrive, let me know 
and I'll try it again, or I'll give you FTP access to my router and you 
can pick the one or two you want to attempt.

I do have the prints, and the negatives. For some strange reason, 
several of the prints are even worse than the digital images! It's a 
good thing I didn't care about the prints!

On most of them, it does look as if you can &quot;kinda&quot; tell what's there, 
but they're so blurry that all of the detail is lost, and the detail is 
what's important here. I understand that software doesn't work miracles, 
you can't replace what's not there, etc. I was just hoping that the 
photos could be enhanced somewhat, to make them easier to tell what's 
there. If they can't be fixed, they can't be fixed, and I'm screwed. 
That's life, I guess.

Again, thanks ever so much to those of you who've offered to try to do 
what you can. It's greatly appreciated! I'll be looking forward to 
hearing from you, and seeing what &quot;miracles&quot; you've wrought!

Michael
