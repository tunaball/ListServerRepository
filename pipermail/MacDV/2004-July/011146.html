<PRE>Super VHS only creates higher resolution in the black and white of it. 
The color is still just VHS, and full of all the problems associated 
with VHS. It is a half-hearted solution due to the unimproved color. 
Hi8 is generally superior to Super VHS in terms of picture and color 
quality. However, ALL these analog formats get HUGE benefits when 
played back through a time base corrector, especially Hi8 recordings 
which have phase lock issues, something I've seen a lot in Hi8 
recordings. It goes from unacceptable to best case.

Buying a multiformat Regular 8, Hi8, Digital 8 Recorder WITH Time Base 
Corrector (aka TBC) will breath new life into all old 8mm stuff, 
PARTICULARLY if intending to archive to DV or DVCAM.  Sony makes one, 
the GV-D800 which also has 1394 [Firewire/iLink] output. I have one, 
and find its mechanism is a bit suspect mechanically, but the video 
quality with all older formats listed is stunning compared with non TBC 
playback, with direct digital dubbing into Final Cut via Firewire (as 
an uncontrolled source,) making it quite a nice solution.

Here is one link to the Sony box:

</I>&gt;<i> Here's a paragraph I found on the internet which explains it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Super VHS, Super VHS-C, and Hi8 are the improved versions of the
</I>&gt;<i> above three formats. Where VHS and 8mm create 240 lines of
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal picture resolution, SVHS and Hi8 create 400 lines.
</I>&gt;<i>  These super models cost about $500 more than their counterparts,
</I>&gt;<i> but the cost is worth it if you wish to do serious
</I>&gt;<i> teleproduction. Although the super camcorders can record and
</I>&gt;<i> play regular tapes, if they record a super tape, it can only be
</I>&gt;<i> played back on a super machine. Also, in order to make a super
</I>&gt;<i> recording, you must buy the more expensive super tape to feed
</I>&gt;<i> your camcorder. Remember that you are always free to copy your
</I>&gt;<i> super picture (perhaps using your camcorder as the player) onto a
</I>&gt;<i> regular VHS tape (recording on a regular VHS recorder) for
</I>&gt;<i> distribution.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After searching a while, I found the same camera on ebay, and it was

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can I play Hi8 cassettes in an 8mm camcorder?  I've been searching on

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi8, which is &quot;yes&quot;).  Also, many people are also asking the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compatibility between 8mm, Hi8, Digital8, miniDV, etc., and that is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not my question.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I could just go pop in a Hi8 into the camcorder and try it, but i

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for your advice.
