This shop is on Dundas Street West and specializes in video.
  Another Mac store in Toronto is on Queen St East near the Beaches area 
it is newly renovated store but the staff is not nearly as helpful.  
Northstar Computing near the Chelsea Inn is my least favorite 
everything they sell is higher than official Apple pricing.

In London I have dealt with Mostly Digital, most recently on Saturday a 
silver mini i-Pod for my wife, and have found them to be reliable and 
helpful.
www.mostlydigital.ca

Waterloo also has a Apple dealer I have spent money at and find 
pleasant to visit, I believe their name is Avenue Computing.

My advice when buying anything is deal with people that you find 
helpful and pleasant to deal with.  Most places treat you the way you 
treat them so if you go in and try to nickel and dime them on each 
purchase they may not want to spend as much time with you as they would 
with a customer that appreciates the value they provide.  I am not 
saying don't shop around but don't try to beat them down to the point 
were the transaction is no longer interesting to them.  After purchase 
service is the type of thing that is priceless and this will be 
developed if they don't cringe when they see you come.

Good luck

Gerhard
