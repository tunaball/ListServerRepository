<PRE>I got the standard, USA Warranty, retail boxed unit. Got everything  
that comes with the unit that Canon ships. I checked the warranty,  
too, one of the first things I look at when I find a good deal.

The sales with the price that low are rare and do not last long.

For example, the $600 sale was at B&amp;H and it was right before a  
holiday and they only had a certain number at that price. I know,  
because a waited too long to purchase and missed out.

The sale for $650 where I got mine was at 6ave,com. I don't know how  
long it lasted or if they only had a certain number for sale, as I did  
not hesitate that second time.

When I was watching HV20/HV30 prices, these sales would only come up  
every 6 months or so, and I relied on dealmac.com to notify me. (I am  
not associated with that site).

I understand your skepticism, as I have seen those types of deals too,  
the bait and switch scams. I always check esellerratings.com before I  
buy from a store I do not know.

For example, I just bought a Rode VideoMic for $119 at CompuPlus.com.  
Never heard of that store before, but they had lots of good reviews. I  
haven't received it yet, but I am confident.

</I>&gt;<i> and up, delivered (good for a 2nd battery, at least). etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Or,  USA factory sealed w/ Mfg warranty BODY only for $550, total.
</I>&gt;<i> If you can believe what they are saying....

</I>&gt;<i> The best price I've sen for one that appears to be complete Canon
