I see. But today's hard disks are more secure. Your opinion is based on 
old technologies.
You probably know that if you drop a MacBook(Pro), the hd stops working 
and heads go to sleep instantly.
I never had problem with recent hard disks.
But I DO know we have to trat them with care.
For an exemple not use a notebook in a car when the car is movin' 
(you're not the driver of course!) because it's not good for the heads 
when (and it always happens) the car is shaken in a difficult bend.
What about filmin' in a car? Probably the same&#8230;
But then I'm very careful even for tapes, even for books. I always 
treat things with respect: my books and  my records could be sold for 
new 20 years after I bought them&#8230;
So I'm not afraid by hard disks in cams&#8230;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's true for analog tapes. If you choose the right brand of course 
(I'm personally sold to TDK for all my tapes, cds and dvds). But 
digital tapes are more prone to loose datas. Cosmic rays are damagin' 
all magnetic recordings. I've seen that on Sony's disquettes (the best 
brand for disquettes 15/20 years ago) that I tought completely secure.
And when a digital media is damaged the content can be much more 
damaged than an analog recording that looses only a second or two: a 
lot more can  be completely unreadable.
For multi cameras you're right of course but I'm not rich enough to buy 
two HD camcorders at the same time!

For tapes: they take physical space and collect dust!
