&gt;<i> I see. But today's hard disks are more secure. Your opinion is based on
</I>&gt;<i> old technologies.
</I>&gt;<i> You probably know that if you drop a MacBook(Pro), the hd stops working
</I>&gt;<i> and heads go to sleep instantly.
</I>&gt;<i> I never had problem with recent hard disks.
</I>&gt;<i> But I DO know we have to trat them with care.
</I>&gt;<i> For an exemple not use a notebook in a car when the car is movin'
</I>&gt;<i> (you're not the driver of course!) because it's not good for the heads
</I>&gt;<i> when (and it always happens) the car is shaken in a difficult bend.
</I>&gt;<i> What about filmin' in a car? Probably the same&#138;
</I>&gt;<i> But then I'm very careful even for tapes, even for books. I always
</I>&gt;<i> treat things with respect: my books and  my records could be sold for
</I>&gt;<i> new 20 years after I bought them&#138;
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm not afraid by hard disks in cams&#138;
</I>
Very True ;) but I'm sometimes hard on my gear not because I WANT to but
because I have to. I also take the Murphy approach to things, if it can
break it will break. I shoot all over the place, cars, motorcycles, glidecam
a LOT of glidecam. Which involves running, tripping falling, (well hopefully
not ;) the glidecam system itself bumping into things (I've never hit the
camera on anything)

When doing fight choreography people hit the camera sometimes, or you.....
Hit them...


I really think we need to define our terms of secure, as I think we are
different ;)

&gt;<i> That's true for analog tapes. If you choose the right brand of course
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm personally sold to TDK for all my tapes, cds and dvds). But
</I>&gt;<i> digital tapes are more prone to loose datas. Cosmic rays are damagin'
</I>&gt;<i> all magnetic recordings. I've seen that on Sony's disquettes (the best
</I>&gt;<i> brand for disquettes 15/20 years ago) that I tought completely secure.
</I>&gt;<i> And when a digital media is damaged the content can be much more
</I>&gt;<i> damaged than an analog recording that looses only a second or two: a
</I>&gt;<i> lot more can  be completely unreadable.
</I>&gt;<i> For multi cameras you're right of course but I'm not rich enough to buy
</I>&gt;<i> two HD camcorders at the same time!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For tapes: they take physical space and collect dust!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> mc
</I>
Space and Dust are not a problem if it works. And your definitely right
about the digital vs analogue. But I know that tape works for me in the
above situations. I won't go digital until I know the same about the HD. The
very fact that it has a motion sensor and shuts itself down to preserve
itself is a problem. That = drop out. Now I can have drop-outs for severe
high frequency vibrations and or a large enough g-force (initial) on tape
but I would assume (bad to do I know) that it would be MORE detrimental to a
Hard Drive.
