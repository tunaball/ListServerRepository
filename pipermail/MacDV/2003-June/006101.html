<PRE>Really in need of help here folks.

After many, many successful, similar projects, I've now encountered a 
issue I can't solve. Problem: I set up &quot;new project,&quot; connect FW 
cable from (plugged in to AC) Sony TRV310 (Dig8) to iMac 800, 768 
RAM, OS 10.1.5, using iMovie 2.1.1 (preferences: import to timeline, 
and/or shelf makes no difference in solving problem), auto break at 
new clip. Set in DV mode, click &quot;play&quot; and &quot;import (yes- it shows 
&quot;camera connected.&quot;) In this set-up I'm capturing project on a new 
external 120 Gig Firewire, 7200 rpm with Oxford 911 bridge (as I have 
many times in past with similar un-fragged drives.)

All goes well for a few minutes, then the &quot;problem&quot; -- &quot;import&quot; light 
goes out with a blank screen on iMovie, though on the camcorder LCD 
the video is still happily playing, but it's not being captured. I 
can get it going again by simply clicking stop in iMovie, Play and 
Import, and it continues OK for another random amount of time. (Of 
course I have some sloppy cuts.) But sooner or later it stops 
Importing video, again with the camcorder still running.

Here are the variables I've tried.


- retarting iMac to be sure no other apps are running
- turning off Classic
- capturing to a different, firewire HD using same iMac set-up
- using different source cassettes in camcorder
- the usual fiddling  with FireWire  connections to be sure they're tight
- initiating &quot;start&quot; of camcorder by manually pushing play on 
camcorder, and export on iMove.

- even borrow a friend's later version Sony (Digital8) camcorder as 
source, but get same problem.

--

Next I try from the start on my new (pretty much unused as yet) 
TiBook 15&quot; 1G with 1G Ram, 60 Gig Drive (50 gig available), OS 
10.2.6, iMovie 3.0.2 and set up project to save on the built-in 
virgin drive. Same random interuptions while importing.
--
Only common device I can think of is the Firewire 6-4 cable (Sony, 
and never had trouble with it in the past). I've just ordered another 
in any case, but it will take a few days.

Have any of you ever experienced this problem? I've followed many of 
the posts on this list from the beginning, and am constantly amazed 
at the depth of knowledge gathered on one list. If anyone can offer 
an insight I would be most grateful.
