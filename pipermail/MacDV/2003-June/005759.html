<PRE>I've downloaded iVCD after I read the post but can't try it until I've scrounged up the cash to buy Jaguar. I did notice an order form in with the software so perhaps you can now run it after you pay for it without a big watermark.

On the other option in Mac Addict Magazine, I did download the Mac Developer's Tools (took a marathon set of sessions) during the time when I had first asked about making SVCDs. I've got a bunch of assorted tools downloaded. All I need to do is upgrade to Jaguar and sort them out. I probably have most of what I need but just need Jaguar so they'll run right.

something like:

&gt;&gt;<i>Plus Toast Titanium. You need Toast to Burn the SVCD.
</I>
&gt;<i>not anymore, *if* you are running 10.2 you can buy iVCD which &gt;will convert &amp; burn SVCD in easy GUI one-step. $30 
</I>
&gt;<i>It is still in beta there - it works but leaves big watermark
</I>
&gt;<i> -- I bet they are damn close to release.
</I>
&gt;<i>the folks there wrote me:
</I>
&gt;<i>The biggest difference between iVCD and Toast is MPEG-2 and &gt;Super VCD support.  We love Toast and use it here to make VCDs &gt;and had recommended it to folks who ask us how to make VCDs.  &gt;But other folks needed to make SuperVCD.  We asked Roxio at &gt;Macworld in January when they would add MPEG-2 and SuperVCD &gt;support but they would not say  - maybe its coming to Toast we &gt;don't know.  Anyway so for SVCD we had to tell folks how to make &gt;Super VCDs with the various GUIs and command line tools out there &gt;but many would complain about the complexity of the process and &gt;how confusing &gt;it all was...thus iVCD was born for folks who &gt;want to make &gt;SuperVCDs &gt;without all the complexity.
</I>
&gt;<i>hope someone finds this useful info!
