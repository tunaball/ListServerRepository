<PRE>Please ignore the earlier post --- it has an email address that is 
going away soon, and I forgot to put in the real reason for my post -- 
what really works for media conversion?

Do any of the list member who have upgraded to FCP4 also have the 
Formac Studio DTV firewire media converter?  The FCP4 website no longer 
shows many of the media converters that were supported under FCP3....is 
this just because APPLE has not been able to finish testing the other 
units to certify them (they work, but you are on your own???) OR has 
APPLE dropped support for these products by design (i.e., the code 
recognizes the unit and ignores it as an unsupported device?

I got caught in this &quot;unannounced sunset policy&quot; when they moved from 
FCP2 to 3 .... some users stated that the Sony DA1 still worked 
(although it does not AFAICD) under OSX 2.5.  I really wish Apple would 
warn us that they plan on EOL products that we use in our  businesses 
so that we could at least try to make a business case to change their 
minds!

Anyone have any experience they care to share?  I had planned on 
purchasing the Formac Studio DTV unit, since it also gave me some DVR 
capability.  Lucky for me, the unit that I had on order was not shipped 
when Apple finally posted their supported hardware list and I was able 
to cancel the order.
