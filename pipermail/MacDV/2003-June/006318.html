<PRE>Well Chris, if you are happy with your B/W G3 for Video Editing, then 
nothing is going to convince you to ever buy a new Mac again. I have a 
B/W G3 sitting in my closet. In my opinion it is wholly inadequate for 
video editing. Two months ago I thought I would get the last of the 9 
bootable G4's. So I picked up the last REFURBISHED dual 867 for $1319 
at Small Dog. Now it turns out it wasn't the last. Apple has now done a 
flip flop and made the NEW line the OLD line with last year's 
motherboard and what's left of their 1.25 GHz chip inventory and 
RADICALLY lowered the price.

So what did I do? Tuesday morning I bought the &quot;NEW&quot; dual 1.25 GHz with 
last year's 2MB L3 cache each for $1599 from Small Dog (members only). 
Now I don't know what sort of cuts only video editing you are doing 
with your B/W G3. But I can tell you right now you don't know what 
you're missing. Even this old dual 867 dog hunts pretty damn fast and 
boots 9 way faster than the B/W.

Three notes on the G5:

1. I just noticed that when you buy the dual 2 GHz 970 with the minimum 
512 MB of RAM that it comes as TWO 256 MB sticks instead of ONE 512 MB 
stick. Is that a rip or what? I think that is not the right thing to 
do. Shame on Apple for doing that.

2. I also just discovered (thanks to OWC's newsletter) that you can 
lower the price of all of the G5's by simply choosing an optical Combo 
Drive instead of a SuperDrive by $200. A lot of us who already have 
Pioneer DVR-105 SuperDrives can appreciate that option. That $200 will 
pay for more than another 1 GB stick of DDR RAM out there in the real 
world.

3. OWC also suggest you save another $29 by deleting the analog modem. 
Don't do it. Why not? Because when you lose your broadband connection 
(and it does happen from time to time) you will be VERY SORRY you saved 
$29 and now have a $100 or more problem. It is definitely not worth it.
