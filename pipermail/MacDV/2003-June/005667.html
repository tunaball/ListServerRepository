<PRE>Thanks for your post Kunga. It's actually off-topic but since many are 
replying...

I hadn't upgraded to 4.0.1 but I think a lot of people were 
disappointed that they unknowingly lost the sharing feature with the 
iTunes update, and are glad that they can get it back. I think some 
people here do not understand that it's about streaming. Yes, it's 
possible to hack it and download, but if you want to download, it would 
be a lot easier via other channels. I use the music sharing feature 
sometimes. It's a great way to get introduced to new stuff. I don't 
think it has an adverse effect upon the industry, not any more than 
radio. But unlike radio, you get to sample music from bands that aren't 
the homogenized darlings of the industry.

I personally would like to see the current music industry crumble, and 
see artists selling directly via the internet (as some artists already 
do). The industry has overcharged for music for ages. Read just about 
any music biography and there will be tales of the industry ripping the 
artist off. I've been involved in music for decades in various 
capacities, from fan to retailer to pro musician. I have friends who 
are pro, some famous, and we all agree the industry sucks. I recently 
met up with some who were touring here in Japan, and they even don't 
mind their mp3s being available for &quot;illegal&quot; download. They said they 
get more fans and make it up in concert revenue. They get a very little 
percentage from sales anyway. Death to the monolith multi-billion 
dollar industry that sits it's fat ass between the musicians and the 
fans, I say!

Sorry for contributing to an off topic post folks - I just hadda.

Rick
