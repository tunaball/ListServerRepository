<PRE>I just have to share this. Walking at noon and trying to listen to 
classical music on an iPod was not working out. I started thinking 
about noise cancellation headphones and within a couple days, Club 
Mac's newsletter featured some by Macally for $50. Compared to $300 for 
the Bose set, I decided to try them.

They do a good job of drowning out low-pitched sounds like car engines 
and air conditioning in the office. As I walked out of the parking lot, 
I thought I heard one of the electric carts coming up behind me. It was 
a car. All I could hear was the sound the tires made on the pavement. 
Even the softest tones of the music were getting through. On a busier 
street, I could hear birds singing, my music and the tire sound all at 
the same time. In the office I could hear voices, though not perfectly.

I'm very happy with them. Maybe the Bose eliminates more frequencies or 
maybe the music sounds better. It certainly should give you something 
much better for $250 more. But for $50 I'm pretty happy with the 
Macally headphones.
