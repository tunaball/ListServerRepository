Here is a quote from a CNET article and it turns out Apple did charge.  
This charge has been dropped however since the introduction of USB2.

update Apple Computer may have found a way to profit from the 
convergence of PC and consumer electronics technologies: Charge 
royalties for the means of connecting them together.

The scheme doesn't seem to be popular with some companies looking to 
take advantage of high-speed, &quot;plug and play&quot; data transfer, and could 
slow the technology's adoption. But the changes also show how companies 
drive technologies to become industry standards, and how Apple is 
following others  in using intellectual property as a powerful 
bargaining chip.

As prospects brighten for Apple's FireWire, formally known as IEEE 
1394, the Cupertino, California, company has begun asking new licensees 
for around $1 &quot;per port,&quot; according to Dick Davies, spokesperson for a 
trade association devoted to promoting FireWire . Only a nominal flat 
fee used to be charged.

The change means that a FireWire-enabled hard drive, for instance, 
could cost $2 more if there are two connectors on the drive. The fees 
may seem small to end-users, but can translate into huge sums of money 
when devices like hard drives ship in large quantities. Many who see 
the technology as a bridge to the world of seamlessly merged computer 
and consumer electronics devices worry the move will further delay what 
has already been a slow rollout.
