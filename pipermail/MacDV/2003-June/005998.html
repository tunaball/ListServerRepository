<PRE>If you already have academic 3 you bought before April 6, the academic 
upgrade price is $399. I bought an academic 3 for $299 at the college 
bookstore at San Louis Obispo Cal Poly Tech Monday and the upgrade 
price was $50. April 6 to June 20 is the window to get the upgrade this 
cheap way and own both versions. You still have thru Friday evening 7PM 
eastern time to find an academic copy of FCP 3 for $299, buy it, and 
fax the upgrade form along with your receipt and $50 credit card info 
to get FCP 4 Upgrade this cheaper way. I called 22 stores before I 
scored my copy. But I still had another 34 to call if that hadn't 
worked. Total 56 in the region including Reno Nevada, Eugene Oregon and 
Cedar City Utah as far as 500 miles away. I was lucky to find a copy 
only 160 miles away. But I would have driven the 500 miles each way if 
necessary. My car gets 35 MPG so it still would have only cost me $60 
in gas.

Cal Poly had quite a few copies left for those in California. Their 
number is 805.756.5311. For you Matt in New York City, use Apple's 
Academic Dealer search engine to find all the bookstores in New York 
State, Connecticut and New Jersey to find a copy that is bound to still 
be sitting on one of those store's shelves somewhere. You just have to 
have the time to devote full time to the search and driving to go buy 
it.

Enter an address without the zip code, check Higher Education and leave 
it on general business. Press FIND and you will get a listing of all 
the college bookstores that sell Apple Software for the entire region 
according to distance from home.
