<PRE>Congratulations Gary Fujihara. You are the first I've read ordered the 
dual 2 G5 on announcement day. Please keep us informed of how your cue 
goes. I hope it is sooner than later. You are going to experience some 
serious video editing and astronomy calculating power with that puppy.

I found that $1599 boots 9 dual 1.25 GHz old 2002 2MB L3 cache model 
deal also at Small Dog for members (previous customers) and couldn't 
resist such a low price. I have a SuperDive and BIG HDs and a fast 
Combo drive and a Verax quiet fan kit.

Then went to the Apple Store in Santa Clara CA (closest store to 
Cupertino) where they said they wouldn't have the G5 until the END of 
August. So it turns out Apple was talking about the last days of August 
when they said &quot;August&quot;. Oh I see. The end of August is a weekend 
Saturday the 30th and Sunday the 31st. That sounds about right. Throw 
in a huge cue and I think most everyone that orders this week may be 
looking at October. I write this not to be negative. Only to point out 
a reality some may have to be prepared for - patience on the shipping 
dates Gary. I hope I'm wrong and it all happens sooner.

I wonder how long before we get some independent tests that benchmark 
all sorts of tasks against the old G4 series with all three G5 models. 
It will be interesting to see how the single G5's perform against their 
fastest dual parents. I have no doubt they will be a lot faster. Just 
real curious by how much.

Saw the iSight camera. It's about the size of a half roll of Mentos - 
3.5 inches long and about 1 inch in diameter. Very elegant looking.
