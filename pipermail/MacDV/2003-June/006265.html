<PRE>Look. Apple doesn't have some psychological warfare game against OS 9 
laggards. They didn't stop allowing OS 9 booting because of some 
conspiracy against those who dislike/are afraid of/misunderstand/can't 
afford $69-$99 for OS X. It is a simple case of simplifying, optimizing 
and supporting the ROMs in the newest Macs for OS X.

These &quot;new&quot; Macs are what's left of Apple's inventory of last year's 
&quot;old&quot; MDD motherboards and &quot;old&quot; 1.25 GHz G4 processors with 2MB L3 
caches each, which happen to allow native booting into OS 9 because of 
their ROMs. The &quot;new&quot; dual 1.25 GHz G4 is not a pair of crippled 1.25 
GHz processors from early 2003 with only 1 MB of L3 cache each. No. 
These are the &quot;old&quot; 2002 1.25 GHz G4 processors with 2 MB of L3 cache 
each in the &quot;old&quot; 2002 MDD motherboards WITHOUT a SuperDrive, a 40 GB 
smaller HD and 256 MB less RAM. If you think those &quot;deficiencies&quot; are 
worth the $800 difference between what the 2002 model was selling for a 
month ago REFURBISHED, then I think you should wait until 
October-November when you might be able to buy a G5 IF the advanced 
sales cue has subsided by then.

Yes this computer runs OS 9 like a bat. No Apple is not &quot;allowing&quot; you 
to boot natively into 9 now because &quot;the coast is clear.&quot; These are 
simply older motherboards from last year that happen to have that 
capability. It's a fire sale on the most powerful G4 to ever boot into 
OS 9 natively. Simple as that.

i predict these will all be sold before the end of July and Apple will 
be facing the biggest drought of new PowerMacs not available for sale 
in the company's history.

By the way, the single 1.25 GHz G4 model going for $1299 is the 2003 
1.25 GHz G4 with ONLY 1 MB L3 cache - a far weaker machine for only 
$300 less - not in my opinion worth the difference between it and the 
dual model. IE a foolish choice when you can get radically more power 
for only $300 more.
