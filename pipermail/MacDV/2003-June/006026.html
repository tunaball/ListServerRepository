You were/are just as free to get the $350 academic price as Kunga. 
Previous ownership of FCP 3 was not held against you :-)

I haven't met anyone lately who thinks Apple has logical pricing, but 
I don't fully agree with this thread ranting about FCP prices. 
Except for one brief blip, FCP 4 costs $499 academic/individual 
purchase, and an upgrade is $399.  Not a great deal, but logical. 
There was a very brief period, during which a few people got a 
special deal, which saves them $50 off the upgrade price.  That 
abberation didn't last long, and few of us were even aware of it, 
until reported on this list.  $50 hardly pays for Kunga's gas.

I can see being upset about missing out on that brief pricing quirk. 
I can see being upset that a few people got a really good deal.  I 
wish I had bought Netscape early, too.  But I am arguing against the 
idea that this pricing quirk is anything like a standard Apple 
academic pricing policy on FCP 4.  Last week, last month, next month, 
what we saw and can expect to see, is FCP 4 academic at $499, and an 
upgrade at $399, for individual academic purchases.  The bizarro 
purchase/upgrade combo low price came and went in about two weeks, 
although valiant hunters/long-distance drivers like Kunga have 
tracked down a few surviving members of that supossedly extinct 
species in more recent times.

I've been using FCP 3 for about a year, and have been happy to have 
it.  Upgrading to FCP 4 will cost me $399.  I will be happy to have 
it, too.  A few jokers recently got FCP 4 for $350, with various 
delays and hassles, and most are paying $499.  I am not going to 
switch to a PC over this.
