<PRE>Thanks for the warning about XL1's. It's good to know about potential problems before you drops a few thousand bucks.

&gt;<i>shooting. Even if an XL1 is tricked out to accept pro level &gt;field audio, there are several potential problem areas in the &gt;audio chain concerning the mics, the mixer, and the audio &gt;connection itself which are prone to variability - and far more &gt;critical when the destination ......
</I>
Wouldn't the quality of the picture drop because you're throwing out image area? If you are going to shoot 16x9, perhaps high-definition would be a better idea.

&gt;<i>What it comes down to:  if you want 16x9, shoot 4x3 and later &gt;take the EXACT slice of 16x9 you want for your widescreen show. 
</I>
Might I add to the following, have someone take responsibility for making sure the clapper is at the beginning or the shot (and even better at the end too). Just finishing shooting a piece where I did it all my self, I can tell you that it sure would have made things smoother had I had someone to remember to do this and do it for me.

&gt;<i>3) PLEASE use a well marked (Scene and Take) slate, INCLUDING &gt;clapping the clapper. That's right, even in video... Our film &gt;has no slates, sync issues, and 45+ hours of footage to, well, &gt;DE-CYPHER the best we can, adding a huge amount of uncreative, &gt;unnecessary maintenance time to the edit. A slate would have &gt;saved the day, and our (or your) sanity.
</I>
I saw an article in a recent American Cinematographer (the one that included tributes to &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; cinematographer Conrad Hall) about the long hours that camera crews often are required to put in. It brought up a number of concerns and information about this: The quality of the work goes downhill after 12 hours. (So it may go past take 3 into 4, 5, 6 and beyond.)

It becomes a very definite safety issue if there isn't layover time allowed to recover  sleep. In fact it told about how an Assistant Cameraman on the movie &quot;Pleasantville&quot; lost his life after a 23 hour shift when he fell asleep at the wheel of his automobile. I don't think any movie benefits from excessive all-nighters.

&gt;<i>4) If you are going to pull all-nighters and do the low budget &gt;thing, learn about a) caffeine and b) L-Tyrosine (which, if you &gt;don't know, is your &quot;second wind in a bottle.&quot; Take 3, trust me.
