KEY Specification not mentioned. This is LAST YEAR's 1.25 GHz processor 
with the 2MB L3 cache. This is the STEAL DEAL. I bought one Tuesday 
morning only two months after having bought a dual 867 for $1317. Why? 
Because I wouldn't pay the over priced $2500 two months ago and I am 
happy to pay $900 less now for the LAST most powerful dual Mac G4 that 
can boot OS 9 and gain 766 MHz between the two faster processors and 
double the cache and a 25% faster bus all for only less than $300 more 
than I paid for the dual 867 in late April. I have no doubt I will be 
able to resell my dual 867 for what I paid for it.

&gt;<i> As Chas says, this hardware is using the older motherboard without

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No timeline offered on how long theOS 9.2/OS10.x  dual booters will be

My GUESS is not long. This is using what few parts are left from last 
year. I predict they will be SOLD OUT within a few weeks. i predict 
severe PowerMac shortage or full NONE LEFT before the end of July.

I got mine from Small Dog and they were only allowed to buy 19 from 
Apple. They are among the largest resellers of Macs outside of Apple. 
Better move fast on this one if you see the light. G5's are an Autumn 
phenomenon - maybe even Winter if the pre-production sales cue gets as 
long as it might.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One hopes that the software writers that haven't yet, will get drivers 
</I>&gt;<i> out for OS 10 so that the need to boot into OS 9 is significantly 
</I>&gt;<i> reduced. Printer and scanner drivers particularly.
</I>
If you have any legacy software you like to run this Mac rocks in 9.
