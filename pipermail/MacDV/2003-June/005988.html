<PRE>Right. But there is a window between April 6 when FCP 4 was announced 
and this coming Friday June 20th when if you buy FCP 3 Academic Full 
Version for $299 from any Apple Academic bookstore you can send in a 
form with a copy of your receipt to get FCP 4 Upgrade for only another 
$50. Total $349 for BOTH. That's what I did at this last minute and 
what any of you can still do if you qualify for Academic FCP pricing 
and can find one of the last copies for $299 left on a shelf somewhere 
near you. For me &quot;near&quot; was 160 miles away and well worth the 320 mile 
5 hour drive.

There is a search system on the Apple Educational section that will 
display for you all of the Academic dealers including addresses and 
phone numbers in your state after you enter your city according to 
distance from you. Use that to phone all the college bookstores and ask 
if they have a copy of FCP 3 left and if it's $299. Some are charging 
$399 now. It seems that Apple raised the price of FCP 3 on their last 
shipments to Academic dealers. However, this does not appear to be an 
across the board situation since I got mine from a dealer who only 
recently purchased more and sold it to me for only $299. Luck of the 
draw situation. The FCP 4 version you get is the Upgrade version.

Deadline for mailing is Friday June 20. You can also FAX the 
application in.
