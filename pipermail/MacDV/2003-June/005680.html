<PRE>Chris,

Thanks for your post. Unfortunately many of the links got broken up. In 
searching for the info on the web, I found other debates going on. Many 
are questioning whether the commercial was CG or not. One even thought 
the commercial was made by the Swiss artists.

&quot;To anyone who doesn't believe this is real, you should check out the 
30 MINUTE chain reaction video the same guys made in the 80's before CG 
existed. It blows away the COG video from Honda. Not that I don't like 
this video, but their other video is even better. Check it out - it's 
called &quot;The Way Things Go&quot;.

Others feel it's a rip-off:
&quot;As soon as I saw this ad, cool as it is, I thought &quot;Ripoff!&quot; There's 
two German guys (maybe Swiss?) who bought an old warehouse in the early 
nineties and did a very similar thing, for about twenty-thirty 
minutes&quot;. &quot;With things being flipped, burnt, shot, lit, swung and 
floated, it's clearly the inspiration for the Honda ad, even down to 
the wheels rolling uphill. Of course, if Honda *hired* them it's 
another matter entirely&quot;.

The artists are considering taking it to court. The makers of the 
commercial seem to be acknowledging now that they were inspired by the 
film. &quot;There is a difference between copying and being inspired by&quot;.
&lt;<A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv</A> and radio/2943206.stm&gt;
With the popularity of the commercial, I'm sure we'll be hearing more 
about it.

In any case, I also came across a much better quality clip of the 
commercial. If anyone would like to see it, it's here:
