<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Derek Roff &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/macdv.html">derek at unm.edu</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Greg Joswiak, vice president of hardware product marketing at Apple,
</I>&gt;<i> said:  &quot;The scores were higher under Linux than under Windows, and in
</I>&gt;<i> the rate test, the scores were higher with hyperthreading disabled
</I>&gt;<i> than enabled.  He also said they would be happy to do the tests on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows and with hyperthreading enabled, if people wanted it, as it
</I>&gt;<i> would only make the G5 look better.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I find this curious.  Joswiak says that Apple chose Linux as the
</I>&gt;<i> faster PC OS, in order to have a valid G5 vs. Intel comparison.  From
</I>&gt;<i> a marketing standpoint, I would have used Windows, since that is what
</I>&gt;<i> most customers will use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I> From a marketing standpoint, you're obviously right -- and it would 
have made the G5 look even better too!

But then we'd get endless complaints from people that Apple &quot;hobbled&quot; 
the Intel by deliberately using a &quot;bloated&quot; OS. The Linux geeks around 
the world would howl loudly about the G5 being a fraud, and that it 
couldn't stand up to a &quot;lean&quot; OS.

As Joswiak said, in EVERY situation where a variance could be used, the 
one that FAVOURED the competition was used.

Mark my words -- these benchmarks will hold up under the scrutiny.

&gt;<i> As to the importance of floating point speed, I have always read that
</I>&gt;<i> all graphics, image and sound processing, such as video, games,
</I>&gt;<i> PhotoShop, CAD, ProTools, etc, need floating point for all the
</I>&gt;<i> serious number crunching.  If true, this would make floating point
</I>&gt;<i> performance more important for all the work I do, except email and
</I>&gt;<i> word processing, for which the slowness of my typing and thinking
</I>&gt;<i> speed is the bottleneck.
</I>
What people should really pay attention to here is the clear DIFFERENCE 
between the SPEC results (which show the P4 or Xeon and the G5 
more-or-less evenish, with a slight edge going to the G5) and the 
Real-World results (which consistently showed the dual-G5 machines 
doing things about TWICE as fast as a comparable dual-Xeon setup).

The reason for this discrepancy? IMO, this is partially the superior fp 
ability on the G5, but *mostly* due to the addition of cutting-edge 
technologies in every other part of the machine -- serial ATA, 
hypertransport, 1GHz frontside bus, very very fast RAM, improved ASIC, 
etc.

This clearly shows that the G5 has to &quot;fight&quot; less with the rest of the 
system to do its work than the P4 or Xeon does. I predict that when the 
real-world benchmarks come out for the lower (single-proc) G5 models, 
they will still be fast -- very comparable to P4s with 150% the GHz 
rating -- but more like MATCHING them in speed overall rather than 
SURPASSING them in speed the way the dual G5 does with the dual-Xeon.

&quot;To use the Mac is to be confronted, over and over, with the idea that 
the most mundane task can be done artfully and compassionately, 
beautifully and invitingly. &quot; -- Glenn McDonald
