<PRE>Hello , 

I&#185;m a newbie with DVD  . I&#185;ve been using a Mac since 1985 and I also have a
PC . I recently bought a 800 MHz   imac , and since I already had purchased
a LaCie  DVD &#173;RW drive I figured I wouldn&#185;t need a super drive (dumb move ).
I got &#179;Capty DVD&#178; with the LaCie Drive  and find it confusing, the
documentation seems to have been written in Japanese and translated to
English  . I did finally manage to compile a video &#173; ts file which I burned
with toast titanium  but when I attempt to play it nothing happens , I tried
it with the Apple DVD player , with my home DVD player (Emerson) I was using
some media I bought at Circuit City ,
Maxell DVD-R   I also tried a couple of Fuji DVD-RW discs all to no avail .
Is there a fool proof media combination out there? I&#185;m trying to do training
videos for horsemanship , and thought providing the trainee with a DVD
rather than a VHS tape would be a nice touch . This is all doubly
frustrating to me since I&#185;m used to Mac and it&#185;s ease of use . I then
figured that perhaps the learning curve was too steep ( I have other things
to do also) I tried down loading &#179;Media Pipe&#178; and if I thought Capty DVD was
confusing ..... Well I&#185;m a quick study  ordinarily , but I need a bit more
learning to tackle that one . Then I thought , well perhaps the technology
will evolve a bit more and in the mean time I can take my videos with my JVC
mini dv recorder , import them to imovie , edit , and then export through a
&#179;Hollywood Dazzle bridge I bought, to a VCR and provide edited VHS tapes . I
got the Dazzle bridge the other day and I was very excited to do just that .
I hooked everything up and tried to export ....and got a message stating
that my &#179;camera is a different video standard from imovie  &#179; and I could not
export to it ..... I need some help , if nothing else , a shoulder to cry on
would be nice , even better some leading around by the hand  would be swell
too.

The fact that I live in a remote area doesn&#185;t help much , the nearest Mac
group is 160 miles from here.
