<PRE>More info:

The VideoNow player is not only portable, it's pocket-size. Each 
personal video player measures approximately four by six inches, 
making it perfect for little hands and kids on the go. This little 
package packs a big punch - its black and white LCD screen features 
sixteen levels of greyscale, contains 80 by 80 pixels and measures 
1.7 by 1.3 inches, resulting in a great, quality picture!

The VideoNow line is 100% &quot;kid friendly.&quot; To use the VideoNow 
personal video player, simply pop in a VideoNow Disc and press play. 
Each circular, three-inch VideoNow Disc contains up to twenty-five 
minutes of uninterrupted content. VideoNow Discs feature a special 
proprietary format and will not fit into or play on other media 
players.

VideoNow Disc titles will include the hottest names in children's 
entertainment - with 24 titles scheduled to be available this Fall as 
VideoNow products hit the shelves. And, with up to 20 hot new titles 
to be introduced each quarter, kids can collect and view many of 
their favorite television, sports and entertainment programs! Each 
VideoNow Disc will retail for approximately $7.99, VideoNow Disc 
Three Packs will be available for approximately $14.99.

In addition to its great visuals, the VideoNow personal video player 
features a self-contained speaker that delivers crystal clear sound. 
It also has an audio jack for headphone or speaker use (headphone and 
speaker not included). And with just two &quot;AA&quot; batteries (not 
included) you can enjoy more than seven hours of continuous 
entertainment.

The VideoNow personal video player will be available in two stylish 
colors: titanium and cobalt. And, each VideoNow player will come 
complete with a special sampler VideoNow Disc featuring over a half 
dozen excerpts from today's most popular programs.

VideoNow (for ages 6 years and up) is scheduled to be available at 
leading national retailers in the Fall of 2003 for an approximate 
retail price of $49.99. Additional software titles and a full line of 
VideoNow accessories including a handy carry case, snap on lamp (for 
late night viewing), Disc organizer, headphones and more, will also 
be available.
