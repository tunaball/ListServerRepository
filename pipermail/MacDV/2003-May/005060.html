<PRE> From PowerJack at SpyMac.com today
Publisher of MacWhispers today Posted on: 05-13-2003 04:09 PM

I've already published what I actually can say on this one. 
Unfortunately, I am tangled up in a situation where the actual 
manufacturer is also building two products for me later in the year, 
and everyone with whom I deal there knows I publish MacWhispers... as 
does an Apple developer channal person involved in my projects. in 
other words, I actually have more first hand info on this topic than 
(probably) anyone else on the Mac web, but can't say squat.

  - The PPC 970 is real, is ahead of schedule, and is slated for both 1 
and 2 processor Power Macs... very, very soon.

  - The 15.4-inch PowerBook is also real, has been nearly completely 
redesigned since January, will be released with a PPC 970 chip, and 
will have a Chi Mei Optoelectronics-produced 15.4-inch LCD with a 
non-standard higher resolution than 1280x800... also, very, very soon.

  - The Power Mac will move to a new enclosure, one with an anodized 
aluminum front panel, mathcing the new PowerBooks.

  All of this I have previously published. And, sadly, that's all I can 
say about any of it, other than this: None of this is guesswork or 
speculation. It's dead-level fact, straight from the people doing the 
work.

  I have to dance a fine line with the MacWhispers site, and what info I 
spread. My business must come first.
