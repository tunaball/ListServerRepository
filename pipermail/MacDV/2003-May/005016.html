<PRE>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/macdv.html">digitalx169 at mac.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Did it not occur to you we do not all have the pro tools not the pocket
</I>&gt;<i> book to go with it?
</I>
If you don't have the money to do a project correctly, why bother?

&gt;<i>  Just like someone said the other day they would
</I>&gt;<i> rather save the money on Screenwriting software and rent a 24p camera. 
</I>&gt;<i> A
</I>&gt;<i> very sensible way of thinking (IMO)
</I>
Um ... does it not occur to you that whether you are spending money on 
a 24p camera *or* buying screenwriting software, you are still SPENDING 
THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY? So how does choosing one or the other *save* 
you any money exactly?

Besides, it's all a question of value. That $200 or so will buy you ONE 
DAY'S use of a 24p camera or a LIFETIME of use of the scripting 
software. NOW which is the better idea? Again, depends on what you are 
doing. If you scrimp on the screenwriting software, your script may 
never be read, so your need for a camera is moot. If you rent the 
camera but nobody can follow your poorly-written script, you end up 
with garbage.

&gt;<i>  I just purchased adobe Premiere 6.5 for Mac OS X.
</I>
Oops. No comment.

&gt;<i>  I will need now
</I>&gt;<i> to think about what miniDV camera to get (thinking of a Sony TRV-19). I
</I>&gt;<i> have a wife and a son and another little one on the way so I have
</I>&gt;<i> limited monies to spend on my gear. It will take me longer 'yes' to
</I>&gt;<i> write this screenplay out the old fashioned way but nothing comes
</I>&gt;<i> without hard work.
</I>
I don't know your situation, but I can say this: if it's worth doing, 
it's worth doing well. Obviously you are the only one who can decide 
what thing to buy when, but if you're going to do this on a serious 
level, you need to be willing to spend some bucks and get the 
right/best tools for the job. It all depends on what exactly you are 
shooting, of course, but I've yet to see anybody who went &quot;cheap&quot; 
everywhere they could do very well in the business.
