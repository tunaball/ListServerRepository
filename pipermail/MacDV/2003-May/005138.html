<PRE>The cost of Jag is a factor, plus there hasn't been any software that runs on it only to make me want to spend the money quite yet. iMovie runs much better on 9 than 10 and that makes me a little reluctant to move to ten until I get a faster Mac which is not something that is happening soon. I'd prefer to save the money for Final Cut Pro since it can run on 9 than blow money on Final Cut Express if it is going to perform like iMovie 3 is on 10. 

I have 512mb of RAM installed on this 800Mhz iMac.

Not very surprising. Why are you not on Jag? It's significantly faster 
than 10.1.5. Also, how much memory have you got running on that machine?

I was running into the limits of iMovie rather quickly so having to learn a bit more to run Final Cut is not really an issue. What I want to know is if I spend the $299 for the Express version of Final Cut, will it perform adequately or do I need a G4 to use it. If so, I'll have the hurdle of getting a whole new Mac before I even get to saving up money for the software.

FCP is a significantly different -- and some would say more complicated 
-- program than iMovie. I would guess it would perform at around the 
same speed as iMovie. Perhaps adding RAM or using a large, FW dedicated 
drive would make more a difference.
