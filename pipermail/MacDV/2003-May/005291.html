&gt;<i> I've been getting some nasty 60 cycle hum when recording sound with my

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in an old house that was built in the 1920's and some of the wiring 
</I>&gt;<i> is old. Is it possible that some of this old wiring is unshielded and 
</I>&gt;<i> basically &quot;broadcasting&quot; 60 cycle hum and the mic cables are picking 
</I>&gt;<i> this up acting as antennas?
</I>'s possible.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are balanced mics (those that use 3 pin XLR connectors) less prone to 
</I>&gt;<i> picking up hum?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes they are

&gt;<i> Is there any way to shield my existing set up if it is the wiring. (It 
</I>&gt;<i> picks up even if the camera and mixer are running off battery power.) I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought of the crazy idea of putting aluminum foil against the likely 
</I>&gt;<i> walls with old wiring. Would this help?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You might do better to shield the nic wires.

&gt;<i> Another audio topic:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to replace that cheap Nady mic mixer with something that can 
</I>&gt;<i> handle XLR connectors. I'm looking for something that can be run off of 
</I>&gt;<i> battery power if I'm away for AC power sources.
</I>Tough requirement.
&gt;<i>  I'd also like to have pan controls so that I can place mic sources in 
</I>&gt;<i> their correct spatial orientation because of mixing to stereo and I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> like equalization controls. Also line inputs. I'm thinking 4 mic inputs 
</I>&gt;<i> and 2 stereo line inputs would be just about right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've started to look around at mic mixers and this is what I've found 
</I>&gt;<i> so far: I can buy a new Behringer mixer for about $119 but I heard that 
</I>&gt;<i> they don't hold up.
</I>They are not bad

&gt;<i>  I saw an Alesis mixer for about $160 that also included some onboard 
</I>&gt;<i> effects but unfortunately didn't look like it took batteries.
</I>Alessis holds up no better than Beringer. And I don't like them. 
Behringer is good for the price.

&gt;<i> I also saw a Peavey mixer for about $175 that had 6 mic inputs and 
</I>&gt;<i> could run off batteries (3- 9 volts -- 2 for the mixer and 1 for 
</I>&gt;<i> phantom power).
</I>Qua;ity wise Peavey is as good as the other two. If it meeets your 
reequirements at least it's cheap.

&gt;<i>  Does anyone know of any others I should be looking at? Faders aren't a 
</I>&gt;<i> big necessity for what I'm doing, do gain knobs would be just fine.
</I>I have good luck with a battery operated Yamaha. But I don't know if 
they still make such a thing.

Take a look at Nady . Mackie just started making &quot;Tapco&quot; mixers maybe 
they have a battery one.
