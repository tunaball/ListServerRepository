&gt;<i> I bought a variable-speed regular-8/super-8 movie projector on eBay for
</I>&gt;<i> $70 (they range from $50-$100+$20 shipping).  As I've done transfers,
</I>&gt;<i> I've done the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Aim the projector at the inside of a white binder.  You can also use
</I>&gt;<i> a video transfer box (i.e., a mirror and piece of ground glass), but I
</I>&gt;<i> found the binder had less &quot;glow&quot; around bright objects.  Some people
</I>&gt;<i> also use a clean whiteboard, spray-painted piece of foam, etc.  You
</I>&gt;<i> could also use a movie screen, but the contrast goes down the further
</I>&gt;<i> away you put the image, and the texture starts to show if it's too bumpy
</I>&gt;<i> and too close to the projector.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Aim the camcorder at the image.  In the case of the transfer box,
</I>&gt;<i> the light bounces off of the mirror and goes through the ground glass
</I>&gt;<i> directly into the camcorder.  In the reflective methods, you just point
</I>&gt;<i> the camera at whatever you're projecting the image on, and try to get
</I>&gt;<i> the camera as close to the lens of the projector as you can so that
</I>&gt;<i> you're not getting too much of an angle.  As long as you're pretty
</I>&gt;<i> close, there isn't any noticable &quot;trapezoid&quot; effect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Plug the camcorder into an external TV to use as a monitor (angled
</I>&gt;<i> away from the movie screen so as not to cast light on it).  I do this so
</I>&gt;<i> that I can adjust the focus, zoom, brightness, etc., with more precision
</I>&gt;<i> that I would be able to do if I had to use the tiny fold-out screen of
</I>&gt;<i> my camcorder.  Also, on a more practical note, the projector's controls
</I>&gt;<i> are on the right and the fold-out screen is on the left, so I can't put
</I>&gt;<i> them close together if I open the fold-out screen of the camcorder.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Adjust everything.
</I>&gt;<i> a. Start playing a movie, and get the projector into focus.
</I>&gt;<i> b. Adjust the position of the camcorder so that the image is centered
</I>&gt;<i> (might require adjusting various tripod legs, twisting the camcorder on
</I>&gt;<i> the tripod, raising &amp; lowering the camera, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> c. Adjust the zoom so that the TV (camcorder) can't see any of the
</I>&gt;<i> dark edges.  miniDV will actually capture slightly around that anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> so you don't have to feel like you're &quot;losing&quot; anything on the edges.
</I>&gt;<i> Once I think I have the position and zoom right, I nudge my camcorder
</I>&gt;<i> slightly up, down, left and right, and make sure the blackness is just
</I>&gt;<i> beyond the borders of what I'm zoomed into.
</I>&gt;<i> d. Adjust the focus on the camcorder.  You can stop the projector for
</I>&gt;<i> a moment, turn on the light, and carefully hold a piece of paper with
</I>&gt;<i> some printing on it while you manually adjust the focus if you want.  Or
</I>&gt;<i> you can just let the camcorder auto-focus, which I've found is just as
</I>&gt;<i> good.  I do like to lock the focus once it is right, though, because
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes in dark conditions the camcorder can get confused.
</I>&gt;<i> e. Adjust the variable-speed knob on the projector until the movie
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't flicker or pulsate on the TV screen.
</I>&gt;<i> f. You might want to set the exposure to manual and adjust it as you
</I>&gt;<i> record, or you might just let the camcorder to its best.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Rewind the movie, and start recording.  Don't forget to make shadows
</I>&gt;<i> on the screen when the movie's over! (&quot;Yeay! Shadow time!&quot; as my
</I>&gt;<i> 2-year-old says).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've found that the movie certainly looks better on the screen than it
</I>&gt;<i> does on video.  Camcorders just don't have the dynamic range to handle
</I>&gt;<i> the high contrast between the bright scenes and the dark ones.  On the
</I>&gt;<i> film, you can see the bricks in the shadow at the same time as the sun
</I>&gt;<i> reflecting off of the lake, but on the camcorder you have to choose one
</I>&gt;<i> or the other.  On the camcorder, you have a narrower range, which you
</I>&gt;<i> can slide around with the &quot;exposure&quot; dial, but which ultimately you can
</I>&gt;<i> only use to decide which part of the dark-to-light spectrum you want to
</I>&gt;<i> capture.  I also notice that the colors are much less colorful when
</I>&gt;<i> captured onto the camcorder.  Bright red flowers come out as slightly
</I>&gt;<i> red.  Bummer.  On the other hand, once I realized that it wasn't going
</I>&gt;<i> to be as good as the original, I started to relax a little bit about
</I>&gt;<i> making sure this was completely archival quality, and decided to just
</I>&gt;<i> capture the stuff that would be interesting to watch just to make it
</I>&gt;<i> more convenient to do so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually someone will come up with an inexpensive attachment to a
</I>&gt;<i> slide scanner that will allow consumers to scan their own 8mm film and
</I>&gt;<i> create digital movies directly from the scans.  At that point the
</I>&gt;<i> mismatch in frame rate will also not matter--you will be able to just
</I>&gt;<i> set your computer to play the movie back at the original 18fps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck!

</I>&gt;<i> A local film store offers to transfer 8 &amp; 16mm films to video--but
</I>&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;<i> to VHS. Another transfer will be necessary to make the video digital.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm concerned that this intermediate step may lose too much
</I>&gt;<i> resolution,
</I>&gt;<i> and would prefer a straight film-2-digital solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is that possible? Any good references in New Jersey or Manhattan? or
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> the web?
