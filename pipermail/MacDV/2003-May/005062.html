<PRE>As an owner of Final Draft, Screenwriter 2000, heck, every script 
writing program there is or was... I have to agree. There is no good 
screenwriting software. So, I started a software company, E-Soft 
(Entertainment Software) and our flagship program, in the works, is 
&quot;Scenario,&quot; by far and away, and FINALLY, real screenwriting software 
which blows away the others. Most importantly, the programming was 
directed by a screenwriter, rather than a software engineer. What most 
people don't realize (who make screenwriting software) is that it isn't 
word processing that's going on. It's screenwriting. We make it fast 
and intuitive from the get-go, even for first time screenwriters. The 
&quot;e&quot; in E-Soft also stands for &quot;empowering.&quot;

Scenario, when complete, will be the complete front end for Final Cut 
Pro. Everything up to the cut, as we have modules covering breakdown, 
budgeting, casting, scheduling, script supervising, etc. etc. - 
everything before the cut, and integrated into the cut from the set. 
It's all about real productivity.

There will be light and pro versions as well.

Sorry for the shameless pitch, but the screenwriting issue has cost us 
a lot of money after being inspired by even more frustration!
