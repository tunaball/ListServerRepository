<PRE>The three student filmmakers are played by actors. The actors used 
their real names in the film, and the conditions were a bit different 
than your average shoot: they were sent off into the woods for 8 days, 
and literally shot the film themselves. The only contact that they had 
with the crew was through notes and minimal rations left for them to 
pick up daily (they also carried a GPS, so they couldn't really get 
lost).  They knew their 'characters' well, and knew the general setup 
of the 'story', but everything that happens as the story unfolds was a 
surprise to them. It's why the film is so believable.
