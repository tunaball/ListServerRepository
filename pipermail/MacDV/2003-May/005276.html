Desktop &amp; Tower Units:

1 8100 (w/G3, full ram load, pro. video and sound additions - VideoVision
Studio Telecast &amp; JackHammer SCSI Accelerator.  A great Beta solution, as
well as standard analogue ports.  Terrific sound studio support, as it will
take XLR.)  Some have sarcastically wondered why is this 8100 $425?  It has
more than the g3, it is maxed in ram and has the Videovision Studio Telecast
cards, cable and breakout box and a JackHammer.  The complete VV goes for
$50 - $250 on ebay--cost $15k new, the G3 upgrade ave. around $75, and the
ram max depends of course on how much you already have, but seems to ave.
$10 - $15 a stick, shipped--far more retail.  The JackHammer averages $40 -
$50 shipped.  Not to mention the upgraded drives.  Then there is putting it
all together, and then there is shipping, as I do offer it all at a shipped
price.  With the breakout box, which is a huge rack-mount unit, about $80 -
$100 to ship, cause the box is that big and that heavy.
                                                $425 shipped
