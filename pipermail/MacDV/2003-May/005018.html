<PRE>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/macdv.html">digitalx169 at mac.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I recent someone stating I am not a pro because I do not use
</I>&gt;<i> all the pro tools. Not all of us have the $$$ to blow. Did anyone ever
</I>&gt;<i> consider this?
</I>
I didn't see anybody on this list say that you weren't a pro. For my 
part, all I said was that people who have &quot;made it&quot; in this industry 
tend to use tools such as Final Draft. That doesn't mean one can't 
produce quality work on other tools, only that it's harder.

Do I dismiss &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (the books) because they were 
written on a typewriter rather than a word processor? No.

Saying you don't have the money to &quot;blow&quot; on screenwriting software 
when your stated intention is to produce screenplays is like saying you 
want to be a dentist but don't have the money to &quot;blow&quot; on things like 
anesthetic or surgical drills. A pair of pliers and a cannister of 
nitrous oxide will have to do.

Can you still practice dentistry? Yes. Does anyone in their right mind 
want to use you? No.

James Lileks, on Apple's iMovie versus XP's Moviemaker:
&quot;Was [my bro-in-law's] machine cheaper? Yes. But time is money; I've 
never had to claw my way through the sodden mess of a corporate website 
looking for the one driver that will let me do what I want to do. I've 
never had to spend a Sunday afternoon trying to understand what iMovie 
wants me to do, because it does what *I* want it to do. He said that 
Moviemaker made him feel stupid, because he couldn't figure out the 
simplest tasks.
I'll say this for his machine, though: if he ever wants to back up that 
3.3 GB movie file on floppy disks, he's all set.&quot;
