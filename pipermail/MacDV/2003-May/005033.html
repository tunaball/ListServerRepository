I remember this movie that followed none of your advice had no budget 
and the script if there was one was probably written on a used napkin.  
This was the Blair Witch Project most people considered it a successful 
project.  The road to success takes many turns, improvisation is one 
the most interesting twists.  I would encourage the guy with ideas and 
a notepad over some stale fart with all the latest gadgets.

Keep on writing
