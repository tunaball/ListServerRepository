<PRE>970 Macs, which will ship with Panther, will run all the current 32-bit 
software however faster the motherboard architecture will push it. Then 
64-bit recompiled versions of all our software will run twice as fast 
as that. Panther will just run in 32-bit mode on pre-970 Macs. Panther 
should let us run the software we have now on all the G4 Macs. As to if 
it will run on G3 Macs, that's an open question that should be answered 
at the developer's conference end of June in SF. My own guess is that 
Panther won't run on G3 Macs. But this is purely a guess and not backed 
up by any technical knowledge. I hope my guess is wrong.  Anybody on 
the list know about G3 Macs and Panther compatibility yet?
