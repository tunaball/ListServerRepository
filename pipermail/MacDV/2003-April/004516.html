<PRE>Thanks Matt. I had no idea that anyone would take what I wrote as 
seriously as that. Of course it's all speculation. Duh. I thought this 
string was a speculative string and was wishing more on the list would 
chime in after writing all that. But with a response like TK posted, I 
can understand why no one would dare join in the speculation for fear 
of being treated like an anti-war demonstrator in March. Talk about a 
Chill Factor. TK thinks that if I write something out of my imagination 
that I am a criminal. I guess that pretty much sums it up for this 
like. The Gestapo has spoken. No free speech on this list. Too much 
chance someone will misstate &quot;facts&quot; in a fantasy and very speculative 
string.

What the hell is so wrong about writing speculative entertainment on a 
list. Does it all have to be dry how to do its? I was really hoping 
that someone like TK would correct my mistakes rather than just whine 
about them. I can't tell from his complaints what is wrong about what I 
wrote. He could have at least been helpful. I never claim to be a know 
it all. I am always wanting to learn and TK could have made a 
constructive post instead of just a list of complaints without 
corrections.

What did I write that is so blatantly wrong? And what is the correct 
thing? And how the hell did I scare anyone? Anyone want to claim I have 
scared them? I thought I was providing entertainment value to the list. 
Did I not? ; ^ )

I guess TK is having a bad day. Or is it he economy stupid?
