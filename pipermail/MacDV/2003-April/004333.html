</I>
he is free to voice a stupid opinion and free to hide behind the most 
discredited ideology of the last 100 years. I am free to tell him it is 
stupid. I am free  to counter the influence he intends to weild. If you 
put it in my face in a sig in an email that is distributed to many 
people, it is fair game. Make a statement. Don't expect not to be 
challenged.



&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Nothing wrong with taking issue or with a group dealing with multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> camps of opinions either...freedom of speech.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am all for freedom of speech. Say what you mean . Don't hide behind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the dead Nazis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He said what he meant, I'm sure, and it's not for you to judge his 
</I>&gt;<i> intent.
</I>Of course it is.

&gt;<i> He was not hiding behind anything, clearly.
</I>Clearly he was.

&gt;<i>  Learn rhetoric, bub.  He is
</I>&gt;<i> making an ironic point that our government is using tactics similar to 
</I>&gt;<i> those
</I>&gt;<i> used by Nazi propagandists to achieve their ends.  It's an interesting 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> thought provoking point.  You don't have to agree, but do not argue ad
</I>&gt;<i> hominum.
</I>
Ad hominum would be if I called him a fat jerk.
I didn't. I suggest that his choice of quotes to support a point he was 
unwilling to make in  his own voice is distatsteful to me in the extreme 
and I will excersize MY free speech.


&gt;<i>   I could for example, argue with him that the Nazi's would have
</I>&gt;<i> demonized the Muslims,
</I>
Wrong. The muslims liked the nazis .

&gt;<i> Afganies and Iraqies, while our president has made a
</I>&gt;<i> point again and again to America that he would not tolerate prejudicial
</I>&gt;<i> bigotry against any of those three groups, but that doesn't mean that he
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't hit upon a good conversation starter.  Nevertheless, it's in his 
</I>&gt;<i> sig,
</I>&gt;<i> which means all of this is better left for private discussion or for 
</I>&gt;<i> another
</I>&gt;<i> board, but NOT HERE.
</I>
I quite agree. NOT HERE. leave it off. Go to alt.conspiracy and have it 
out. leave it out of my face or face my comments.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would assume from the quote that Charles used that in fact he does 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think that they deserve such liberation, and would be  happier to let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them suffer. Not me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may assume that, but you don't know that.  In any case, wrong or 
</I>&gt;<i> not,
</I>&gt;<i> this opinion of yours does not preclude his right to post whatever he 
</I>&gt;<i> wants
</I>&gt;<i> on his sig.
</I>And to have it rebutted for the benefit of those who might consider it a 
somehow valid opinion or pointer to an opinion.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we'll have to lump you in with all those...militia maniacs...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am hardly a militia maniac. More like an Animaniac.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will quote our current president, whom I did not vote for and am no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> big fan of, &quot; Let us fight them with soldiers instead of firemen&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And one from my mother,  &quot; I prefer OUR liars to their liars&quot;  Thanks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quote who you want.  It's your right...in your sig.  But on this list we
</I>&gt;<i> only talk about MacDV, except in our sigs.
</I>
So I should call him a fat jerk in my sig and that would be alright?
I should do a rant inn my sig and you would no longer take me to task?
  What a cartload.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To that end, anybody here using a Radius Telecast set up?  I just got 
</I>&gt;<i> one to
</I>&gt;<i> noodle with and could really use set up diagrams and manuals.  The cards
</I>&gt;<i> seem to have DAV connectors or some such that I have no idea what to do
</I>&gt;<i> with.  I could also use the drivers and Fusion editors and effects 
</I>&gt;<i> software
</I>&gt;<i> that came with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

This is my sig and not to be commented upon.
&quot;When I found out that the average IQ is 100 I was shocked.
This means that most people are flat stupid. It's just scary.&quot;
