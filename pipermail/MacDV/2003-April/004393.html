<PRE>Hello, David:

I don't know what Post started all the OT posts and it doesn't really 
matter. As you have pointed out, this is way OT for this List. You 
seem like a thoughtful, well-informed, and open-minded person, and I 
agree that a thoughtful discussion is in order.

Please consider starting a Newsgroup, using an existing NG, or start 
a Yahoo Chat Room, and alert others as to where the discussion is to 
take place. But, I'd not want to see &quot;Macintosh Digital Video List&quot; 
degenerate to the level of so many other forums that simply lose 
their way.

TIA,
Pete

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Interesting how my favorite Mac Digital Video forum has turned into 
</I>&gt;<i>some kind of chaotic discussion of War, Freedom, Rights and Ethnic 
</I>&gt;<i>history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It is a fair question to ask whether our wonderful, beautiful 
</I>&gt;<i>precious America is becoming more and more isolated from the rest of 
</I>&gt;<i>the world. And while many among us feel that this a positive 
</I>&gt;<i>development, I ask, is this really a good thing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Most of us Americans are already isolated to the point they rarely 
</I>&gt;<i>see world news, and have little knowledge of anything outside the 
</I>&gt;<i>USA. Our own President had never been anywhere outside North 
</I>&gt;<i>America, and had trouble even naming world leaders (never mind 
</I>&gt;<i>understanding their agendas) before his inauguration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I would guess that most Americans know France is led by Chirac only 
</I>&gt;<i>because he is our latest Fox News enemy. The media is quick to 
</I>&gt;<i>remind us that we gave ungrateful France its freedom after WWII, but 
</I>&gt;<i>somehow the same media always seems to forget that without France's 
</I>&gt;<i>help securing our own freedom in the Revolutionary War, Tony Blair 
</I>&gt;<i>would be *our* Prime Minister, and that upon the Centennial of our 
</I>&gt;<i>Independence France presented us with a beautiful gift which is now 
</I>&gt;<i>our very symbol of Freedom, the Statue of Liberty. But here in 
</I>&gt;<i>America, &quot;you're only as good as your last hit record.&quot; So France is 
</I>&gt;<i>the bad guy du jour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Mention Rwanda, and our eyes glaze over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As a traveler who has been to more than just my home state, I can 
</I>&gt;<i>tell you that our ego-driven view that 'the USA knows all the 
</I>&gt;<i>answers; my way or the highway' is not shared by quite a few people. 
</I>&gt;<i>And for good reason. It is one thing to be a home of wonderful 
</I>&gt;<i>freedoms and quite another to claim that the only way to get there 
</I>&gt;<i>is through our good graces, thank you very much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Worldwide resentment grows daily. And many among us are not only 
</I>&gt;<i>*not* bothered by this development, we are further empowered by it. 
</I>&gt;<i>It is into this somewhat scary environment the Goering quote comes 
</I>&gt;<i>in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What Goering said is an ironic warning that could at least be 
</I>&gt;<i>considered by fair-minded individuals, even if it should (hopefully) 
</I>&gt;<i>turn out to be false in our present case. Just because he was a 
</I>&gt;<i>despicable murderous Son-of-a-Bitch doesn't automatically mean his 
</I>&gt;<i>statement can't in some way be a useful warning against the 
</I>&gt;<i>possiblity of it hitting closer to home. They say a frog put into a 
</I>&gt;<i>hot pan jumps out, but a frog in a pot of water slowly brought to 
</I>&gt;<i>boil is cooked. Those bubbles we're swimming in may not be a jacuzzi 
</I>&gt;<i>after all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Personally, I think that belligerent threats, intimidation, violence 
</I>&gt;<i>and War are perverse, antiquated ways to deal with problems between 
</I>&gt;<i>disagreeing societies (no matter whose 'side' one is on), an 
</I>&gt;<i>approach that is better suited to insects than humans, and that if 
</I>&gt;<i>all the money, effort and lives devoted to battle were instead spent 
</I>&gt;<i>on enforced promotion of goodwill (which is not an oxymoron) and 
</I>&gt;<i>free discussion of how to alleviate tensions through discourse, the 
</I>&gt;<i>world would be a better place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The optimist in me quotes from a Brit, John Lennon:
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The cynic in me quotes from another German, Albert Einstein:
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;There are only two truly infinite things, the universe and 
</I>&gt;<i>stupidity. And I am not sure about the universe.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I, for one am open to further thoughtful discussion, though 
</I>&gt;<i>admittedly this Forum is not really the appropriate place for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thank you for your time.
