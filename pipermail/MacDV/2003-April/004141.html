<PRE>Hi all,
	I'm going to take some video at my sister's wedding in a few 
days and I'm looking for suggestions on how best to improve the audio 
side of things. I've taken video at a couple of weddings (my 
brother's and a friends) and everyone has been very happy with it 
(not professional or anything but still very watchable). However, 
I've been quite disappointed with the quality for the audio - 
particularly during the ceremony.

This time I've borrowed another miniDV camera to go along with my 
MV20i (another single chip model unfortunately but we don't know 
anyone with a 3 CCD model). I'm able to get a sound feed from the 
auditorium sound system (which is very good quality) but I'm 
wondering what is the best way to make use of it?

I could patch it directly into one of the camcorders as the main 
audio track. The problem is that this restricts that camera to being 
quite close to the sound board which is an OK but not ideal vantage 
point. Alternatively I could capture it directly to the hard disk of 
a Mac. To do that I could use either a Powerbook (firewire) or even 
an old 8600 (which has RCA jacks for sound in).

If I were to capture directly to disk what would be a suitable 
program to use? (could I just capture directly into the iMovie? What 
problems does that have? (is it reliable?)).  Would using the 8600 
with the RCA jack (compared to the mini-jack on the powerbook) make a 
noticeable difference? (of course the Powerbook is more convenient!). 
Any tips of sound rates, settings etc would be very helpful.

Thanks!

Adrian Smith

PS My Dad bought a copy of FCP3 a few months ago (edu discount) which 
he hasn't played with yet. Does that give us any more options.
