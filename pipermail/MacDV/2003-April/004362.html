It sucks to say this because I really don't like killing kids much, but 
if you are going to operate on a cancer sometimes some healthy tissue 
must also be removed, Wow that sucked but it's true.
  I would remind you that only 1/3 as many innoocent Iraqis ( by their 
own count)
have been killed in total war than were killed in NYC on 9/11 by the 
terrorists
that you seem to think can be reasoned with and respected.

</I>We support the Arabs just fine.
They squander it routinely as you know.
What to do? Dump our friends and kiss the enemies ass?

</I>&quot;Lots of people claimed that the war in Iraq would take away from the 
war on terrorism, but it is exactly the war on terrorism.
A country held in sway by an army of terorrists in masks. Many of them 
from other countries. A country actively supporting and paying for 
terror in their region and looking for 'Reach&quot;.
A country with more arms than people. And speaking of that, in Palestine 
they claim that they use bombvests, because they have  no jets or 
artillery.
In Iraq they had machineguns, grenade launchers and artillery as well as 
mig Jets, mortars, missiles and high explosives, available in every 
locale.
But they also seem to have had a lively and well organized bombvest 
industry. What is THEIR excuse?
