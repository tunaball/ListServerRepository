I've yet to find one that does, that's why its good to have more than 
one disk utility available.

To add to your list:

4. There first versions of Speed Tools (the disk optimizer) were a bit 
flakey and were reported to damage many drives (though I never had a 
problem with it personally). IIRC the problem was associated with the 
optimization process being interrupted for whatever reason.

5. They were very slow in supporting HFS+. I think that earned them a 
lot of ill-will and gave TechTool Pro a chance to gain market share.

6. The snowball effect. It seemed like the ill-will from (5) changed 
Norton from being the utility everyone seemed to recommend, to the 
utility nobody could recommend, to the scapegoat of the utility world.
