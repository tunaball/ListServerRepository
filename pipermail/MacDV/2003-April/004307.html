I would caution against using OWC. I ordered a FW Drive from them but 
Retrospect would not back up to it claiming it to be &quot;bad media&quot; and 
Disk Warrior would not rebuild the directory. I have another FW disk 
which does allow Retrospect and Disk Warrior to work. I also tried 
Retrospect and the OWC hard drive with a different computer and got 
the same results.

I tried for almost 3 weeks, via email and phone to get a RMA from 
OWC. I finally got one and sent it back with the specific problems. 
OWC told me that they would specifically check the drive with 
Retrospect and Disk Warrior. They reformatted the disk and sent it 
back to me ignoring the Retrospect and Disk Warrior issue.

When I finally got ahold of a service Rep Eric I told him that I 
wanted my money back. He told me that they would send me a new drive. 
I sent the old one back and they once again just reformatted the old 
one and sent it back.

I once again told them that I wanted my money back, but they told me 
that they had a 30 day money back policy, even though the majority of 
the 6 weeks was due to their lack of service and false promises, they 
refused to refund my money.

I have seen many people talk about how much they like buying from 
OWC, but I would never buy from them again. Since that time, I have 
heard from many people on this list and other forums that have had 
similar problems with OWC.

I recently bought a Wiebetech drive dock

Now I can purchase a bare drive at about $1 per gig, do a video 
project and when completed, archive the whole drive, and install a 
new one for the next project.
