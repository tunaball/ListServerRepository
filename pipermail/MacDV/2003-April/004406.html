Got that covered.  Those are on the breakout box.  But on the internal sides

</I>
Thank you, but I understand and have all the connections for the back end of
the card to the Telecast box.  What I'm referring to is on the inside, on
the internal surface of the card.  After you attach together the
VideoVision, Studio and Telecast cards, there remains a black connector,
internally, that appears to be a DAV or a SCSI connector...

&gt;&gt;<i> What is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best drive set up for this card?  One fat internal?  2 internal, 1 for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system, 1 for data?  External raid?  (Don't know if I like the idea of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> raid.)  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You need a scsi card that can support external raid for online quality.
</I>&gt;<i> Off line could be run on an internal disk, I imagine.
</I>
JackHammer will do the job on a Nubus system?  Any place to learn building
and setting up an external RAID?

&gt;&gt;<i> Does premiere require any special plug ins for operation with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set up?  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I remember, yes. It was very fussy to get set up and working. Once
</I>&gt;<i> working, I protected the system folder religiously so I wouldn't have to
</I>&gt;<i> re-setup. It's been so many years, I can't recall everything you had to
</I>&gt;<i> install, but there were Premeire related bits as well as system
</I>&gt;<i> extensions.
</I>
Hmmm....what version(s) of Premiere?  Do you recall?

&gt;&gt;<i> Will this set up work with VTR's?  Or is for total offline use?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it would control a pro deck through the Mac's serial port. Both
</I>&gt;<i> assemble and insert edits. Very high end stuff.
</I>
Off the serial port on the Mac, or off the Telecast breakout box?

&gt;&gt;<i> What was the original software?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ?? Just the installer stuff for Studiovision and Premiere. Then there
</I>&gt;<i> was the deck control software and the RAID software.
</I>
Oh boy...where will I find these...anybody?

&gt;&gt;<i> What's the performance capacity on an 8100
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a g3 upgrade?  Will it work witha  G3 upgrade?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could get broadcast picture quality, no problem. But the size was
</I>&gt;<i> 640x480 -- not standard NTSC. A lot of stations would reject that
</I>&gt;<i> output. 
</I>
Any way to boost the size?  Who the heck used that size?  Why would they
make it a useless size?

&gt;&gt;<i> What system did it work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with?  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I had it on a version of OS7.
</I>
Would it work with higher?

&gt;&gt;<i> Where can I find a manual or diagrams for proper hook
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ups, particularly of the cards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, cable Telecast and Studiovision card together. Then the I/O
</I>&gt;<i> is standard stuff -- play deck output to the Telecast inputs, Telecast
</I>&gt;<i> outputs to the REX deck inputs. Mac monitor that plays back video during
</I>&gt;<i> editing goes on the Telecast's Mac monitor connector. SCSI array to SCSI
</I>&gt;<i> card.
</I>
And the scsi card would not hook to the Radius card?  Then what the heck is
that leftover connector on the surface of the card?  Anybody?

&gt;&gt;<i> How do I run a second monitor with the set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up?  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I never did, but you should be able to put the second monitor on the
</I>&gt;<i> Mac's output.
</I>
I see, off the Mac itself?  From the HPAV or HPV PDS video card or from that
wonky built in monitor output that required the funky cable adapter?

&gt;<i> Good luck!
</I>
Thanks, and more to learn!
