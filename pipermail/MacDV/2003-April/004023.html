</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Uh I thought.. that the image looks wider on the computer because of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right - so long as you remember that there really isn't necessarily a

</I>&gt;<i> computer monitor has 72 DPI both ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Obviously the TV does not &quot;squish&quot; it's own native signal. It simply

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order to display it properly,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, its a matter of perspective whether the TV squished or the 
</I>&gt;<i> computer is stretched. The information in the picture is the same - the 
</I>&gt;<i> dots are just closer together horizontally on the TV. I tend to think 
</I>&gt;<i> of the TV as a &quot;squished&quot; picture because years of working the computer 
</I>&gt;<i> environment makes it seem like only a loony lunkhead would make a

</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time  . . .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SR
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>After a good stretch I could see how the pixels being taller would 
create the effects we see. As i have said this is a sticky subject.
But seriously to the original poster I would say that this difference 
between what you see onn the computer and what is on a TV is a well 
known thing and most of us use our cameras or DV bridge converters or 
whatever to check what is coming out from time to time on a Tv or 
monitor. In the olden days underscan monitors were used to monitor the 
edges. Now we have  the opposite concern.
I had an embarrasing incident once when I shot some pictures and framed 
them well on the TV monitor, but my client auditioned the material on an 
underscan monitor and a projector. Ragged edges of the vintage pictures 
were visible and made me look bad.
So i am pretty attentive to the edges. The abiltiy to shoot the whole 
pic and then crop the edges right in the viewer in FCP is sooooo good.
