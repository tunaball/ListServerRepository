</I>&gt;<i> Why are we saying that Norton is Bad? It's saved my bacon more than a

</I>
There are three reasons why people say bad things about Norton 
Utilities:

1. Since they were bought by Symantec, it seems to take *at least* 
three point releases before the thing is actually safe to use. See 
Norton 4.04, Norton 5.03, Norton 6.03 for reference. By contrast, Disk 
Warrior hasn't received a serious update in YEARS (long before OS X was 
even *available*) and yet continued to work flawlessly on drives even 
after they've been converted over to OS X. Symantec is generally blamed 
for

2. Numerous people (including myself) have experienced severe problems 
when the product was installed on our hard drives. I have had this 
problem both in OS 9 and OS X. Both times it was due to the instability 
associated with the extensions the program inserted into the system. 
The actual &quot;Norton Disk Doctor&quot; and &quot;Norton SpeedDisk&quot; apps appear to 
work properly, but the extensions (one of them ironically called 
CrashGuard) play havoc with the stability of the operating system. This 
has resulted in everything from minor corruption to severe data loss. 
Not good for a utility.

3. The inability of the product to catch and fix all problems. Norton 
Utilities has always worked fine for me *when used exclusively from the 
CD,* but compared to DiskWarrior it simply overlooks problems the other 
product finds. When you add in the fact that Norton is more expensive 
than it's competitors, well it's just not looking that good anymore.

Claiming that the Macintosh is inferior to Windows because most people 
use Windows is like saying that all other restaurants are inferior to 
McDonald's.
