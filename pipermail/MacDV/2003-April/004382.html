&gt;<i> Interesting how my favorite Mac Digital Video forum has turned into 
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of chaotic discussion of War, Freedom, Rights and Ethnic 
</I>&gt;<i> history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is a fair question to ask whether our wonderful, beautiful precious 
</I>&gt;<i> America is becoming more and more isolated from the rest of the world. 
</I>&gt;<i> And while many among us feel that this a positive development, I ask, 
</I>&gt;<i> is this really a good thing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of us Americans are already isolated to the point they rarely see 
</I>&gt;<i> world news, and have little knowledge of anything outside the USA. Our 
</I>&gt;<i> own President had never been anywhere outside North America, and had 
</I>&gt;<i> trouble even naming world leaders (never mind understanding their 
</I>&gt;<i> agendas) before his inauguration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would guess that most Americans know France is led by Chirac only 
</I>&gt;<i> because he is our latest Fox News enemy. The media is quick to remind 
</I>&gt;<i> us that we gave ungrateful France its freedom after WWII, but somehow 
</I>&gt;<i> the same media always seems to forget that without France's help 
</I>&gt;<i> securing our own freedom in the Revolutionary War, Tony Blair would be 
</I>&gt;<i> *our* Prime Minister, and that upon the Centennial of our Independence 
</I>&gt;<i> France presented us with a beautiful gift which is now our very symbol 
</I>&gt;<i> of Freedom, the Statue of Liberty. But here in America, &quot;you're only 
</I>&gt;<i> as good as your last hit record.&quot; So France is the bad guy du jour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mention Rwanda, and our eyes glaze over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a traveler who has been to more than just my home state, I can tell 
</I>&gt;<i> you that our ego-driven view that 'the USA knows all the answers; my 
</I>&gt;<i> way or the highway' is not shared by quite a few people. And for good 
</I>&gt;<i> reason. It is one thing to be a home of wonderful freedoms and quite 
</I>&gt;<i> another to claim that the only way to get there is through our good 
</I>&gt;<i> graces, thank you very much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Worldwide resentment grows daily. And many among us are not only *not* 
</I>&gt;<i> bothered by this development, we are further empowered by it. It is 
</I>&gt;<i> into this somewhat scary environment the Goering quote comes in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What Goering said is an ironic warning that could at least be 
</I>&gt;<i> considered by fair-minded individuals, even if it should (hopefully) 
</I>&gt;<i> turn out to be false in our present case. Just because he was a 
</I>&gt;<i> despicable murderous Son-of-a-Bitch doesn't automatically mean his 
</I>&gt;<i> statement can't in some way be a useful warning against the possiblity 
</I>&gt;<i> of it hitting closer to home. They say a frog put into a hot pan jumps 
</I>&gt;<i> out, but a frog in a pot of water slowly brought to boil is cooked. 
</I>&gt;<i> Those bubbles we're swimming in may not be a jacuzzi after all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I think that belligerent threats, intimidation, violence 
</I>&gt;<i> and War are perverse, antiquated ways to deal with problems between 
</I>&gt;<i> disagreeing societies (no matter whose 'side' one is on), an approach 
</I>&gt;<i> that is better suited to insects than humans, and that if all the 
</I>&gt;<i> money, effort and lives devoted to battle were instead spent on 
</I>&gt;<i> enforced promotion of goodwill (which is not an oxymoron) and free 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion of how to alleviate tensions through discourse, the world 
</I>&gt;<i> would be a better place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The optimist in me quotes from a Brit, John Lennon:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The cynic in me quotes from another German, Albert Einstein:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;There are only two truly infinite things, the universe and stupidity. 
</I>&gt;<i> And I am not sure about the universe.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I, for one am open to further thoughtful discussion, though admittedly 
</I>&gt;<i> this Forum is not really the appropriate place for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your time.
