yeah cause it really hurts you if I get high and watch seinfeld.
Why is it that you think that people are mature enough to understand the 
irony and evil of Nazi propaganda but not mature enough to smoke a joint?
Who is joining the Ashcroft brigade on this one?

</I>&quot;Lots of people claimed that the war in Iraq would take away from the 
war on terrorism, but it is exactly the war on terrorism.
A country held in sway by an army of terorrists in masks. Many of them 
from other countries. A country actively supporting and paying for 
terror in their region and looking for 'Reach&quot;.
A country with more arms than people. And speaking of that, in Palestine 
they claim that they use bombvests, because they have  no jets or 
artillery.
In Iraq they had machineguns, grenade launchers and artillery as well as 
mig Jets, mortars, missiles and high explosives, available in every 
locale.
But they also seem to have had a lively and well organized bombvest 
industry. What is THEIR excuse?
