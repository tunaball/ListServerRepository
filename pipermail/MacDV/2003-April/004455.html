</I>&gt;<i> hi all
</I>&gt;<i> I moved to imovie 3.0.1 and I've had a torrid time - slow, buggy,
</I>&gt;<i> etc, exactly as discussed on the list
</I>&gt;<i> yesterday I upgraded to 3.0.2 yesterday and it seems miles better...
</I>&gt;<i> is this true?
</I>&gt;<i> anything to watch out for?
</I>&gt;<i> thanks

</I>Hi Mark,

See my posting of 9th April (Mac Digest #2092) where I was responding 
to concerns with iM3 and some follow up postings by others in the same 
Digest and latter editions.

A recent article in the Australian Video Camera and Desktop Video 
magazine on the iLife package was complimentary towards the integrated  
bundle , but was particularly scathing that Apple should release iMovie 
3 with so many problems.

I just hope the people at Cupertino listen to the feedback and do 
something soon as there are a lot of frustrated  Apple customers out 
there in the market place.    From memory, there was one List member 
who said he was not having any hassles with iMovie 3.  I seem to 
remember iMovie 2 also had some problems when released, but these were 
minor compared to iM3 and were soon fixed with an upgrade.

Ian Tucker.

PS.    Kunga usually has his nose to the ground and I wonder if he has 
picked up any drift regarding an upgrade?

PPS.     Erica, if you read this could you enlarge on your comment of 
&quot;resize your window smaller trick&quot; please?   From memory, iMovie 2 did 
not have the ability to resize the viewing window and as far as I know, 
I have not taken any action to change the size of that which appears 
when I first open the iMovie 3 Appn.     Do we take it that you are 
enjoying a hassle free run with iM3 ?
