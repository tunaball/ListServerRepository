I'd agree, 3.0.2 was a big improvement for me in both stability and 
speed, but 3.0.1 was also an improvement over 3.0.0 (for me anyway).

One thing I found interesting is that upgrading to 10.2.5 fixed one of 
the more annoying bugs for me. Prior to that upgrade when I exported to 
Quicktime using the Expert settings, the save file dialog box with all 
the options would come up and I couldn't navigate very well to places 
other than the default. What I mean by that is when I tried to do 
something like move the scroll bar to go up the drive hierarchy, 
sometimes nothing would happen, sometimes a duplicate of the file list 
would appear off to the top-left of the window, just all manner of 
weird things. It also wouldn't let me select (using the mouse) just the 
part of the filename before the three-letter extension, I always had to 
use the keyboard.

What I found interesting about this is that it was an upgrade to the 
OS, not iMovie that fixed the bug. It just makes me wonder how many 
other iMovie (or other application) bugs are really bugs in other parts 
of the system.
