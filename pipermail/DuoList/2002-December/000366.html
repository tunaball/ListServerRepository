...and great dinners with friendly people.

When my family arrived in the UK our possessions were still on a ship 
somewhere and we had no furniture in our house. So we took a week's 
holiday in Wales.

We spent 6 or so days put-puting along in a canal boat from 
Abergavenny to Breacon and back. (pictures and story up on my website 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.goolsbee.org/pics.html">http://www.goolsbee.org/pics.html</A>&gt;) The weather was awful, but 
everyone we met was *so* nice to us. For example we were buying 
groceries in a small village (IIRC Llangattock?) and were soaking wet 
from walking down from the canal (which was oddly perched on a steep 
hill.) A local offered us a ride back to our boat, and then halfway 
there invited us to dinner at his home. He drove back down to the 
boat later than night and drove us all up to his place (on old farm), 
treated us to a fabulous dinner, great conversation, and way too much 
wine for my wife &amp; I. =) After which he drove us &quot;home&quot; for the night.

It was a great intro to the UK which, unfortunately oversold us on 
native hospitality. The Brits, unlike the Welsh, were not nearly as 
friendly and despite the numerous people we had over for dinner, 
never received a reciprocal invite. Oh well. Anyway, I have a soft 
spot for you Welsh folk.


To stay on topic, in case you didn't already know, I live in the US, 
in the pacific northwest specifically.
