<PRE>Welcome aboard Francis,

What is the configuration of the machine you have, i.e., RAM and 
Harddrive size, BookEndz docking station, PC cards?

A basic machine has:		603c/180Mhz processor, 16MB RAM, 
1.3GB harddrive.
Most machines by now have this:	603c/180Mhz processor, 80MB RAM, 
Bigger harddrive.
Fast machines have this:		G3 processor upgrade and/or 
96MB DRAM = 112MB total

Maxxed out 2400's usually look like this:

Interware G3/320 or 400MHz processor...easier to find installed, than 
by itself.
30-40GB+ HD <A HREF="http://dealmac.com/">http://dealmac.com/</A> or installed by MCE, 
<A HREF="http://store.powerbook1.com/">http://store.powerbook1.com/</A>

Newer Tech BookEndz docking station ...eBay
CardBus upgraded

PC Cards for Ethernet wired/wireless, modem, Firewire, USB and other 
expansion options.

Installing RAM is pretty easy, compared to upgrading the processor 
card and/or harddrive.  Doable, but tedious.  Various articles and a 
Quicktime move for doing this are here:

BTW, doing all the above gets you into iBook prices real fast. ;-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm setting up a new (to me!) 2400c but I'm new to the whole Mac world.  Which
</I>&gt;<i>OS do y'all recommend?  OS 8 seems pretty stable.  Is there a big advantage
</I>&gt;<i>going to OS 9.0.1?  What about the transition to OS 9.2?  I want a system that
</I>&gt;<i>will work reliably and is still supportable.
</I>
OS 8.6 is probably the most stable and current, unless you want to 
use OS 9 specific apps, e.g., iTunes, etc.  Many folks here run 
multiple partitions on their harddrive, with OS 8.6 on one and OS 9.x 
on another.  A few intrepid souls, with lots of RAM, have even run 
OSX.

&gt;<i>Which basic software packages should I get?  I was thinking of MS 
</I>&gt;<i>Office, IE 5,
</I>&gt;<i>Virex or Norton anti-virus.  Probably should also get a firewall.  Anything
</I>&gt;<i>else you would suggest or change?
</I>
I've been running MS Office98, IE 5.x, Netscape 4 Navigator Only, 
Eudora all without any problems...other than the usual, to me, 
wierdness that comes with MS software. I'd strongly suggest getting a 
good disk utility app such as TechTool Pro and/or DiskWarrior.  I 
guess everyone probably keeps a copy of Norton Utilities around also.

If you stay away from MS Outlook and keep your MS Office security 
updates current to dodge the various macro viruses and plug some 
other holes in the MS software , you probably can get by without 
anti-virus software, but it's good insurance if you are concerned. 
Others can suggest a software firewall, but if you use a hardware 
router you should be OK...just don't open your node to the world.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Does it make a difference to your answer if I upgrade to 112 meg of memory
</I>&gt;<i>and/or upgrade the processor to the G3/400?
</I>
More RAM is always nice, but finding the 96MB DRAM module to take you 
to 112MB will be difficult and expensive...around $400, special order 
only.  A faster/bigger harddrive can provide a good boost in speed 
and subjectively can make a bit more difference than even the RAM.

The inability to support more than 80 MB RAM officially(and 112MB 
unofficially) along with the difficulty in finding good batteries are 
probably the 2400s biggest constraints.

The G3 upgrade is outstanding, but finding an Interware G3 by itself 
is hard.  Many folks buy one already installed, then just sell their 
basic machine to help fund the purchase.  A 2400/G3-Interware 
equipped machine is probably going to sell for $700-1000, depending 
on the market.  Pretty good deal if you can find one, since folks are 
still paying $300-600 on eBay for relatively stock machines.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've heard of a MacWorld PowerBook CD.  Any good?  Any one got a spare that
</I>&gt;<i>they would sell?
</I>
Probably pretty dated, but not sure what you've heard about it.

There is also a bit of information here, 
<A HREF="http://www.sineware.com/mac2400,">http://www.sineware.com/mac2400,</A> though the editor really needs to 
rewrite most of the site to many of the articles up-to-date. ;-)

Well, that's my core dump...I'm sure you'll get some other guidance 
from the other folks on here, shortly.
