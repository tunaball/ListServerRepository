<PRE>  I have recently come into possession of a neat, almost new APS 
external hard drive case, apparently made for PowerBooks/Laptops.

If you are familiar with the wonderful product line by Applied 
Peripherals Systems (APS) you know the craftsmanship and 
indestructibility built into these cases.

This case is the standard PowerBook &quot;gray&quot;; it is smaller than the usual 
external case (9&quot;x 6&quot; x 1.5&quot;) for portability; it only has one (vice the 
usual 2) 50-pin SCSI port on the back and comes with a 110v to 9v 
transformer/power adapter.

I knew it was smaller than the regular cases, but I figured they had 
engineered it so that I could simply drop one of the many Quantum or 
Seagate SCSI drives I use to upgrade the regular external cases. Not so. 
When I opened the case, I found it did not look at all like the standard 
cases. There could be, but there is not room enough to put a &quot;standard&quot; 
3.5 drive in there, not to mention the wiring is not what I am used to 
either. The SCSI connector is a 50-pin, but somewhat smaller than the 
standard internal connector, so I might have to find a connector too.

See it for yourself at:

<A HREF="http://www.farm-boy-navy-pilot-airline-captain.com/powerbook_aps_case.jpg">http://www.farm-boy-navy-pilot-airline-captain.com/powerbook_aps_case.jpg</A>

The guy who sold it to me was not very helpful in trying to figure out 
what kind of a drive will fit in there -nor were the folks as APS - 
other than to say it probably will take a &quot;narrow&quot;, 2.5&quot; drive, like the 
type in early PowerBooks. I need to figure out what kind of a drive will 
fit in this case and THEN .. find one somewhere.

Do any of you Lististas have any ideas on what and where I can find a 
drive to put in here? Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated. 
Thanks in advance.

Happy New Year !!!
