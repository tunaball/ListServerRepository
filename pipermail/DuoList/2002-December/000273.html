&gt;<i> WRT the &quot;hearing of other languages&quot; I have a story:

</I>&gt;<i> Paddington, and home... unlike many of the London tube stations this

</I>&gt;<i> and in the alley behind the platform there was a row of houses and
</I>&gt;<i> one of them had a loud party with music and many people, obviously
</I>&gt;<i> from west Africa, loudly carrying on. The only other people on the
</I>&gt;<i> platform with me were two veiled south asian women, and one older
</I>&gt;<i> looking English guy in his 60's or so. He looked like a lifetime
</I>&gt;<i> clerk - a post office employee or the like. As he ambled by me he
</I>&gt;<i> cocked his head in the direction of the noise and muttered in a
</I>&gt;<i> east-ender accent: &quot;You wouldn't even know we were in England anymore
</I>&gt;<i> would ya?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was taken aback at first, as I always felt that I stood out as
</I>&gt;<i> being very &quot;different&quot; when in the UK... but then I smiled a
</I>&gt;<i> smart-ass smile and putting on my flattest Pacific Northwesterner's
</I>&gt;<i> accent said:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;yeah, I guess not.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The look on his face was *priceless*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The icing on the cake, was when the train arrived he &amp; I walked into
</I>&gt;<i> the same car, and I watched him as he looked around a sea of black &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> brown faces, and went to the center of the car where the only group
</I>&gt;<i> of white ones were and sat down in the middle of the group of
</I>&gt;<i> blonde-haired students... who as soon as the doors closed and the
</I>&gt;<i> train started moving resumed their loud conversation:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In Dutch!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought his head was going to explode.
</I>
ROFL!  I guess we could nominate that gentleman for an honorary Order of the
Stereotypical American.  ;-)
