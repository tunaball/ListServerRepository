<PRE>Hi  Folks,
  Had to jump in and say. Permanent marker is usually benzene based
This means that benzene will usually react with the plastic to make a bond .
hence the name permanent marker (not really).
  Unfortunately, benzene like any oil ,lubricant de-greaser etc. will damage
the plastic even though it may not be apparent there will be some permanent
affect hence the polishing on keyboards as we use them (oil from your hands
combined with heat that we radiate).
  I know, I know, you want a solution not an explanation. Whatever you use,
it will cause damage, the question is which damage can you live with.
  My suggestion is dilute whatever solvent you will end up using. Sometimes
to clean just the area that is affected will result in a discolored spot due to
solvent
damage.
   Do try the removing agent in a hidden spot to see if it causes damage or
discoloring.
Do dilute the solvent I would also recommend wiping the entire flat surface of the
area,
this way any future discoloration of the plastic as it ages will be uniform.
   Manufacturers texture large flat plastic areas to hide production flaws . Whipping

the entire are underneath the Duo will make it less obvious that marker was removed
using a solvent.
   This is my limited knowledge on the matter , hope it helps . I would also
recommend
using some kind of brush, preferably of natural bristles so that it will not dissolve
into the
powerbooks textured surface. The brush will help remove the ink from the textured
surface.
  Once you've removed the ink, neutralize the solvent  by whipping as much as you can
away
with a damp cloth, as any solvent left behind will continue to react with the plastic
and
&quot;break it down&quot; .

Cheers
Carlos
