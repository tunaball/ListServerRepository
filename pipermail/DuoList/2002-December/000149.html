<PRE>While I agree that Majid's needs are minimal, and I don't know 
doodily(technical term) about Duos or their market value, I would 
have to think a $300-350 2400 would be a great machine with at least 
the opportunity for expansion.  Heck, I've got one that won't run on 
a battery, but runs great on AC...and it would sell for $225. 
(Sidney thinks I can fix the problem if I'd just do a little surgery. 
;-)...so cheap solutions are out there.

The only high maintenance situation I can think of is if you are 
unlucky enough to incur the wrath of GLOD or really need to live on 
your battery power for extended periods of time and need a new 
battery.  Outside that, these things are very durable.

While I'm a bit timid about taking apart a perfectly good machine, 
replacing memory, harddrives or even a processor are not hard, you 
just have to be methodical and careful.

Cheers...

&gt;<i>	My reasons for saying forget the 2400 is that it is a VERY
</I>&gt;<i>expensive high maintenance machine, which far outstrips his needs as he
