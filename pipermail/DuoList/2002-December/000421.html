One of my mailsigs actually. I like it a lot, being a somewhat 
apolitical guy. =)

heh... I refereed some real live professional ice hockey games in

uh...a whole lot slower than a TiBook or new iBook, with

Yeah, I know, I am being *way* too practical! =)

Anyone hear from Sidney Ho *lately*? News on that CPU Upgrade possibility?
He seems to have been sucked into a work-related black hole 
(something I am often guilty of as well!)


Sounds like Sidney needs a vacation, and I have just the right 
idea... it should only take one lap. =)

(inside joke... should prompt a whinny straight from the horse's mouth! =)
