I have a case just like yours, which I bought from APS years ago for the original hard drive from my PowerBook 100.  The Quantum drives for early PowerBooks, as you wrote, fit in there.  Because it only has one SCSI connector in the back, it has to be at end of a SCSI chain.

What size drives do you have in mind?  I may still have one or two brand-new Quantum drives that I collected for my PB 100.
