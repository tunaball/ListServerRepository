<PRE>Several Questions/Comments 2400c/400/80Meg/40GB/Cardbus

1. Via this forum I picked up a &quot;IBM Travelstar 8E&quot; external HD PC card
unit. I was able to transfer small files to it but large files locked up
the unit. I bought a NEO Jukebox 20GB MP3 player over a year ago. The
power plug broke because I think of bad design. So I had over 12GB of
MP3's on it that I had no back up for. I didn't have my 40GB HD 2400 at
the time to back up too. So I then took the 20GB HD out of the NEO
Jukebox and put it in the IBM Travelstar 8E unit and was then able to
back up all my MP3's and transfer large files with no problem. So the
IBM Travelstar 8E is a good unit to use as a external HD pc card unit.
Maybe reformatting the 8GB unit would have made that HD usuable I don't
know. I just saw them on eBay for around $60. 

2. As a thought to the future 2 questions has anyone used a SCSI/USB
adapter for there system. I have a nice scanner 8x14 which I would like
to continue to use into the future. I've seen several different versions
of this adapter any comments on which is best? I've only seen several
one eBay anyone know of regular supplier. I tried Orange Micro but its
discontinued. Regarding the future I had my Apple II from 1982 till 1998
when I bought my first MAC 2400c. So I plan to stay with the 2400c till
something better comes along. I don't like the iBook no pc card port and
the TiBook too big. I have  a G3 Lombard/Bronze as a back up and home machine.
	Just a thought I bought a Lexar Media PC Card usb reader. Thought for
the future to use with future MAC with no PC card port. I bought on eBay
for $15. Have several PC card units which I haven't gotten around to
using yet. GPS, Scanner etc. I also have a couple of PC card HD gotten
via this forum's advice and a adapter to use larger PC card in small
slot. Use as back system for the 2400c.

3. OT I broke the &quot;A&quot; key on my Lombard/Bronze keyboard anyone have just
that key for sale from a broken unit? 

4. Just bought a 20GB iPod to replace my NEO Jukebox anyone get it
connected up on the 2400c or G3 Lombard/Bronze. I have all the MP3's on
the IBM Travelstar 8E unit so I figure I can get them transfered over.
Will have to use firewire card which up till now haven't used. Haven't
use the USB card either. I just pick up stuff when I can never know when
you can use it. Obviously using the Apple II for 16 years I don't stay
on the cutting edge of development. Still using Appleworks II ver on my
Mac for DB via &quot;Deja II&quot;  never got the IIGS emulator working yet. 

5. For those interested in where we all are. I'm in Guam, USA Western
Pacific. No Power, No Water, No Cable, just got the phone back so can
entertain myself on the internet. We just got direct hit with Super
Typhoon Pongsana. I go to Honolulu to do my laundry.

Sincerely

Chris Thornburg
