<PRE>&gt;<i>1. There are a row of 10 lights on the front-left (I'm assuming they show
</I>&gt;<i>battery strength), how do they work?
</I>
They're holes so the sound from the speaker, which is behind them, can 
get out. No lights. There is no external way of checking battery life.

&gt;<i>2. The keyboard is &quot;sunk in&quot; at the bottom right. On the Duos this was 
</I>&gt;<i>because
</I>&gt;<i>the screws on the underside were too tight. Is this a simple fix like
</I>&gt;<i>loosening some screws? The keys work just fine.
</I>
Nothing obvious like it is with the Duos. It is possible that one of the 
plastic &quot;catches&quot; that lock the palmrest into the keyboard isn't properly 
aligned, and maybe is pushing it down? You could follow mine (or someone 
else's) takeapart guide on <A HREF="http://www.sineware.com/mac2400">http://www.sineware.com/mac2400</A> and take a 
look; that level of disassembly is not very invovled.

&gt;<i>3a. One site I came across said that some of the latter 2400s came with
</I>&gt;<i>cardbus already enabled, if so how can I tell?
</I>
If you put in a Cardbus card (like a USB or FireWire card), and the 
machine starts behaving erratically, you're not Cardbus enabled. Note 
that even on Cardbus enabled machines, you'll still freeze during startup 
with Mac OS 9 (but not 8). I don't know of a way of checking without a 
Cardbus card, short of removing the keyboard and examining the 
motherboard for an absence of yellow wires, or two specific resistors 
whose numbers I forgot. From what I can tell, very very few, if any, 
Cardbus-enabled machines were sold in the US (though of course some have 
been modified by their owners to become Cardbus-enabled).

&gt;<i>3b. Are there an pre-cardbus pc-card harddrives?
</I>
All PC Card hard drives that I know of are non-Cardbus, including things 
like CF cards in adapters, but I can't swear by this. I think the PC Card 
ATA spec does not require Cardbus. In any case, there are lots of 
non-Cardbus drives. There are some drives out there that even predate 
Cardbus, in sizes like 40 or 80 MB (but wouldn't you rather use a 256 MB 
CF card?). I believe even the Toshiba 5, 10, and 20 GB drives that are 
used in the iPod are plain old PCMCIA (not Cardbus).

I never had a great deal of luck with these old small drives in my 2400 
(the last time I tried was years ago however), they sometimes seemed to 
hang it until ejected, which was a result of them drawing too much power. 
I bought a PCMCIA hard drive enclosure from MCE which was externally 
powered, and that always worked great. CF cards also worked fine for me.

Ivan.
