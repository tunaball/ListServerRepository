<PRE>At 08:34 PM 4/19/2004, Antonio Malcolm, had this to say :

&gt;<i>Several people have asked me about the dynamic memory protection / 
</I>&gt;<i>allocation software.
</I>&gt;<i>I've read it works very well with Ram Doubler.
</I>&gt;<i>Here is a link.
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/2007">http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/2007</A>
</I>
         Thanks for the URI! Maybe this will help out my Duos.

&gt;<i>The compact flash solution wouldn't have a direct impact on the system 
</I>&gt;<i>memory, and such wasn't my intention. It would be used as VM, using RAM 
</I>&gt;<i>Doubler, to free up some hard drive usage. Some folks boot from Compact 
</I>&gt;<i>Flash, but, I don't see myself going that far with it. Given the average 
</I>&gt;<i>speed of laptop hard drives, I think using CF for VM can only help. I 
</I>&gt;<i>would think freeing up hard drive cycles alone would help things along? If 
</I>&gt;<i>someone has tested such a setup to disprove it, feel free to let me know.
</I>
         If the CF I/O is faster than the internal HD bus, then this would 
be advantageous. Does anyone have any solid numbers on this?

&gt;<i>I could always buy a faster hard drive, but the 5400 and 7200 RPM laptop 
</I>&gt;<i>drives are still a tad pricey, especially considering I am also beefing up 
</I>&gt;<i>my G4 with faster SCSI drives, and, as it is my primary workstation, it 
</I>&gt;<i>needs the money more than the 2400. When 5400rpm drives drop in price, 
</I>&gt;<i>I'll pick one up.
</I>
         Not to mention the extra heat produced by faster spinning drives.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i>I'd like to hear from folks who have actually run X on a 2400, to lend 
</I>&gt;<i>some first-hand experience.
</I>&gt;<i>And Linux. I'm very interested as to what's available and what works well.
</I>
         I have tossed around (in my head) the idea of running Linux on my 
PB's but I don't think MKLinux will cut it for me. I plan on upgrading to a 
3400c and I might first start with a 2400c (given all the cool add-ons that 
can be found although rarely these days). Which ever it is, I plan on 
loading Linux for the speed and capabilities that will be at my finger tips.

&gt;<i>As per the keyboard, I'd love to get my hands on one. Blue, tho I think 
</I>&gt;<i>Pink would garner lots of attention, especially from the ladies ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>again, I've seen many MANY colors on the various Japanese mod sites. 
</I>&gt;<i>Orange would be kinda' cool, tho I doubt I'd find one in the states.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyone have an extra?
</I>
         Sure, I can send you some oranges! ;)

         I think there is a ban on cross border fruit shipments via the 
mail though. :D
