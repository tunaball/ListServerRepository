<PRE>
In early-mid January, I sent my 2400c (NuPowr G3/240)
to DT&amp;T because I was having freezing/GLOD issues. 
This had happened to me once before, and I had solved
the problem by unplugging it and letting it sit for
about a month.  It worked fine for about three more
months, but this time around there was just nothing I
could do to stop it GLODing after only a few minutes,
if I could get it to boot up at all. So off to DT&amp;T it
goes.

I get an RMA # from them in advance.  Send it to them
UPS.  I wait two weeks.  I drop them an email asking
if they've received the laptop.  Thankfully they say
that they have, but I thought it was kind of odd that
they hadn't emailed me to tell me that it was safely
in their hands.  

I wait three weeks.  I drop them an email asking if
they've figured anything out.  They reply, &quot;Oh, sure,
you have a bad G3 processor.  It'll be $200 plus $30
labour to fix.&quot;  Ack!  A little more than what I was
hoping, but of course I want to keep the little Comet
alive, so I tell them to go ahead.

I wait two weeks.  I drop them an email asking if it
has been fixed.  &quot;Oh, sure, we just need you to
arrange for payment.&quot;  This is frustrating.  Why
didn't they tell me that it had been fixed?  So I call
them and give them credit card info, etc.  They tell
me that it will be sent out in a day or two.

I wait ONE MONTH.  I drop them an email.  &quot;Oh, please
be patient, we are still working on your computer.&quot; 
Still working?  You told me that it was done!!  Grr!  

I wait ONE MONTH.  The laptop returns!  The world is
good.  I take it out of the box....but no power cord!!
 I call them.  &quot;Well, if it's not in the box, then I
guess we still have it.  We'll send that out to you
right away.&quot;  Naturally, at this point I am skeptical
about the timeliness of the return, so I go ahead and
put a bid on a yo-yo on eBay.  

Two days later, the power supply arrives!  Of course,
I am shocked.  I had been afraid to start it up on
battery, since it's only good for about 45 minutes and
who knows how much juice was in it.  But I start her
up and everything seems well!

I go through to make sure I still have the 80 MB of
RAM, etc.  Then I get to thinking....I had set the
NuPowr control panel to show the NuPowr logo on
startup, but I didn't remember seeing it during
boot-up.  I look in the Extension Manager...the
control panel is there, but it's been disabled.  Then
it occurs to me...although the machine seems zippy,
could it be possible that DT&amp;T has removed the
(faulty?) G3/240 card and put an original 603/180 card
in?  While although this would be better than nothing,
it's certainly not what I paid for.  I go into Apple
System Profiler and....

Processor Type:  G3/320!!  One of those Interware 320
cards after which we all lust?  Could it be?  I've let
it sit all night running SETI, and it's certainly
carrying along at a zippy rate.  And....the bottom of
the machine is only slightly warm.  Nothing like the
small nuclear generator that I was used to with the
NuPowr card!!

So, in all, despite my frustrations with them for
their apparantly horrible communication skills, I am
very happy to get my machine back, now worth *more*
than it was when I had sent it out.  

Thought you all might find interest in the story.  And
while I'm at it, can anyone think of a reason why I
can't start file sharing on it?  I try to turn it on,
but I cancel it after it's been trying to start for
about five minutes.  

Enjoy!
