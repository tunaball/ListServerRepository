<PRE>Dear Donald

    I have a 2400c/400 Vimage machine for sale. Right now its not booting up and am
and have been using my Lombard 400MHz machine as my main machine for some time.

    Reason for selling 1. Using my Lombard for my main machine. I have been working
on a large project and need the larger screen for working with graphics and haven't
had the desire to get the 2400c up and running again. I'm a pilot and out here long
hours of flying over Pacific the 2400c worked real well in cockpit but Lombard is OK.

    2. I had sent the 2400c of to DT&amp;T(they put in the 400MHz upgrade) for repair it
came back fixed but it just sat around. I had put a larger 32G HD in it. Still wasn't
using it. I then wanted to trade the larger HD out of the 2400c and into my Lombard
because I wanted to keep all my MPEG's on it. When I was in Las Vegas put it in the
shop to swap out the HD but he said the HD wasn't working. Well in my travels from US
back to Guam found the machine not booting up. My be because of local shop working on
it not DT&amp;T. Then put it in local shop here in Guam to swap out HD figuring that
would get it back up but it's still down. Currently original HD 3.2 is in machine
local Guam shop did swap it out.
    3. Sending machine back and forth to continental US is a pain out here. Rather
have a machine locals can work on. I originally had all work done by MCE then when
they stopped used DT&amp;T although they aren't very good at getting replys to emails.
They do good work. I had bought the larger ram to get it up to 112Meg and had it
shipped to DT&amp;T where it was in the shop. But never heard what happened to it, its
lost. So still only 80Megs.

    I still have orig. manuals and box machine came in. It has a broken rear door but
that's never been a problem also floppy drive has broken door again no problem.

Parts included:

PC Cards:

Ethernet,
USB,
Firewire,
CapSure Card/Camera,
Road Rocket for using 2nd display never opened,
Modem 56K,
External HD via PC card. I think 8Gig

also: SCSI Orb Drive backup,
ADB/USB converter video adapter which came with machine orig.
Docking station,
Color Stylewriter 2200 with extras refills, battery carrying case for head.
Extra keyboard (Blue keyboard on machine),
old 180 MHz board
ADB Logitech mouse,
ADB Gravis Blackhawk joystick.

Wetsuit 2.0 well used

If interested how close are you to N. VA I leaving tomorrow to go back to N. VA.
Alexandria then take some stuff I have in storage there and drive to Tucson AZ to
pick up new aircraft and return here. Probably will be taking interstate down VA to
SW Va into Tenn. on my drive back.

</I>&gt;<i> get DSL.
</I>&gt;<i>         My 2400c/240 has accompanied me to Albania and Sonoma and crossed

</I>&gt;<i> like 7.6. I am not particularly interested in mastering new software and am
</I>&gt;<i> indifferent to the pleasures of OSX.
</I>&gt;<i>         But I would like to run cooler and faster.
</I>&gt;<i>         So I want to buy a 320 or  400 Vimage copper processor. If that
</I>&gt;<i> processor is in a machine that's fine - but it's the processor I want.
</I>&gt;<i>         I've not seen a processor for sale on EBay in two years. There've
</I>&gt;<i> been no more than a half dozen 320/400 machines in that time.
</I>&gt;<i>         So here's my offer.
</I>&gt;<i>         Some on the list who own 320's and 400's are considering a G3/12.1
</I>&gt;<i> ibook. On Ebay, they're going for 700-1100$. Others might have already
</I>&gt;<i> bought the ibook and have their 320/400 2400 on a shelf because they love
</I>&gt;<i> it and can't let it go.
</I>&gt;<i>         Let it go to me.
</I>&gt;<i>         I'll pay $350 for a working 320 processor. $450 for a 400.
</I>&gt;<i>         If you don't want to extract the processor, I'll take your machine,
</I>&gt;<i> swap processors and sell it on ebay. For a 320/400 machine, in good shape
</I>&gt;<i> I'll pay $180 more:$530/630.
</I>&gt;<i>         You can come close to swapping your 320/400 for a G3 ibook and I'll
</I>&gt;<i> have the fastest 7.6 in the universe - seems like a deal to me.
</I>&gt;<i>         Please post me privately.
