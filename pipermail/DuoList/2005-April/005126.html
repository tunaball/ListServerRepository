Nick,

	Just a few not so brilliant tips/questions.  Are you using a 
universal install disks?  If it's a disk that came with another 
system like an iMac or later powerbook it may not install on your 
2400.  I think that 9.1 is the latest that'll install on your 
system.  I think the 9.2.x  versions are for use as Classic OS 
with MacOsX.  I am not sure at all what Comcast wants from your 
2400 that isn't available in 8.6 that is in 9.1 but you might be 
able to just install the control panels or the extensions that 
Comcast thinks it needs.  It is most likely that Comcast just 
doesn't want to bother supporting older machines and picked 9.x as 
the cutoff to keep from having to help some poor souls with a Mac 
Classic with system 7.1 trying to get on the Internet with a cable 
modem.  If that's the case, you may be able to just put whatever 
settings comcast wants in their proper place in 8.6 and hook-up 
anyway.  I'd also bet that Comcast has the &quot;right&quot; software for 
your system somewhere because I doubt they booted everyone off 
their system with older Macs.  Look on their website or try 
entering something like &quot;Comcast MacOs8.6&quot; into Google and see if 
you get some better information about using your system with Comcast.

	It would also be a little helpful if you could remember or wrote 
down the messages that the 2400 gave you reguarding why it 
wouldn't allow installation. :-)

good luck,

Randy
