<PRE>I used to keep a journal on my 2300, but I finally spilled one too  
many cans of Sprite in to the keyboard, and when I took it apart (yet  
again) to clean the rubber mat part of the keyboard (the part that  
makes the keys return and gives some feedback... it's kind of like a  
giant TV remote control), the rubber started cracking down by the  
control/option keys.  So I cleaned it as delicately and as best I  
could, then put it back together.  All of the keys took, like, a  
complete second to return after that.  Was one of the final nails in  
the coffin (the final nail being when I dumped an entire glass of  
water in to it... oops.)

Despite the small size, I love the feel of my 2400's keyboard.  I  
have small hands, so it is easier for me, I guess.  I love my  
2400c... probably way too much.  I actually seriously considered  
buying a black MacBook the other day, but my 2400 does everything I  
need it too, and does it really well... I just can't see myself  
replacing it yet.  G3 upgrade, 80-some megs of RAM, Cisco 802.11b  
card, OS 9.1, Office 98, Netscape 7.2, and Outlook Express 5...  
that's all I need on campus.  I would like to find another battery as  
this one is only holding about 45 minutes worth of charge at max  
energy savings.

While I'm rambling, I've owned a Duo 230, PB 540c, Duo 2300c, and 2  
2400s.  The 230 was okay but the passive-matrix screen was kind of  
lame.  I pretty much hated the 540c because it was huge and slow and  
didn't have any PCMCIA (nice keyboard, though).  The 2300 made up for  
its lack of PCMCIA by being very portable and durable and having  
PowerPC.  The 2400... it is perfection.  An actual VGA port, PCMCIA  
(with cardbus, kind of), upgradeable to G3, great screen, just a nice  
machine.  If the RAM was more expandable, that would make it more  
perfect (because I could put OS X on it), but as it stands, I'm very  
very happy with it.  I also have an eMate, but it has a bad motherboard.

Blah blah blah.
