Not in a 2400C it won't... it doesn't know what an Airport card is,
especially running OS 8.6. Any OS over 8.6 doesn't work reliably with
a CardBus mod. And Airport software is not anywhere close to the same
thing as VPN. If you really need VPN software, then the university's
network admin needs to be specific about what client is compatible.
