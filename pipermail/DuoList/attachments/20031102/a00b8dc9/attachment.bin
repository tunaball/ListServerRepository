Shut-down, freeze, ?  ...what exactly happened.

Was he using it on a flat service or on a pillow, lap, etc.?


If it quit do to heat, it should start up again once it's cooled down. 
That said, I did trash a Newer G3 processor when it overheated.


Do you get a green light or nothing at all?


If you decide to mail it off, send it to a Mac place like DT&T
(Calif.)or  TekServe(NY)

<excerpt>I have an old PB 2400c with Mac OS 9.1 installed and

80MB of RAM and one hour of average battery life.

Lately, my nephew have been playing games with it a

lot. Twice last week, the PB would suddenly shut down

without warning in the middle of a game. Last Friday,

after the nephew played 3 hours (with the AC adaptor)

plugged in and the thing went dead for good. Since

then, I couldn't get it to power up again. I tried

everything from pressing the reset button at the back

to removing the battery and not use it overnight but

to no avail.
