Basically, just put the battery in and then ran the Graphing Calculator
Demo until the PB generated the 'going to sleep' warning.


Testing Protocol:

	Battery charged to 100% in PB 2400/G3-320/112MG/30GB HD

	Battery tested in PB 2400/603e/80MB/10GB HD

<paraindent><param>right,left</param>	OS9.1 w/Energy Control Panel set
for No Sleep for HD or Screen

	Battery run until Sleep warning is displayed 

	Testing App: Graphing Calculator Demo: Inequalities

</paraindent>		(Note - This results in minimal HD use...so should be
considered best-case)

	Jeremy's Control Strip Battery Strenght for initial reading

<excerpt>Ralph, somehow I missed exactly how you tested your batteries,
i.e. under what conditions and what software you used.
