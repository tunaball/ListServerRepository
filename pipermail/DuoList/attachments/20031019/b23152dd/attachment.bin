In the FWIW category, I decided to test all my batteries. These vary in
condition from unknown background, to my original OEM, to a new one
barely used, but out of the box for a year, i.e., no way to really know
the number of charge cycles used...which is what it all boils down to.


If anyone cares to compare usage, condition and serial number, it might
be entertaining....since nothing much else is going on the list. A
better test to include the HD would be to create an Applescript to save
the Calc demo file to disk, then reopen and run test again, repeat to
Sleep.


It was interesting how almost all depleted at the same rate without HD
activity. I wonder if the HD would stress them differently,
respectively. I know that at least a couple are only good for
45-60minutes when on an airplane.  While the batteries I own have seen
minimal road use, i.e., mostly on AC, the other 'Unknowns' show the
same two hour capacity...but they may have been used similarly.


Bottomline: 

<paraindent><param>right,left</param>1. The battery 'remaining time'
indicators aren't particularly useful, unless you are using the same
battery and relying on the historical algorithm.

2. Given the lack of HD usage in the test, I'd assume 50% of these
values as working times.

3. If you want to explore battery storage, battery rebuilds, etc. there
are a number of posts in the archives.

Testing Protocol:

	Battery charged to 100% in PB 2400/G3-320/112MG/30GB HD

	Battery tested in PB 2400/603e/80MB/10GB HD

<paraindent><param>right,left</param>	OS9.1 w/Energy Control Panel set
for No Sleep for HD or Screen

	Battery run until Sleep warning is displayed 

	Testing App: Graphing Calculator Demo: Inequalities

</paraindent>		(Note - This results in minimal HD use...so should be
considered best-case)
