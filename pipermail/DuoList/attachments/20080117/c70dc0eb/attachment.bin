I just ran into a 2400c that was going to be scrapped here in
Anchorage.  It has three batteries but no adapter.  One battery still
had a bit of power - enough to turn it on.  The 2400c screen is in
perfect shape, It shows 80 MB  of memory and Power  PC 320MHz... now
if I only knew more about what this all means....

No cards came with it.  No floppy drive.  No optical drive external. 
It does show in the devices it once had an Epson printer but that is
no longer there. 

It is in great shape.  

Found this list.  Any advice about an adapter, how would a person
connect this to the net?  What kind of harddrive could it take?  Is
this just an interesting item for historical reasons now?  I once had
one of these many years ago when I worked in Barrow and liked it.  It
replaced a Duo 2300c with two slot loading monitors.  I did like that
set up for moving things from work to home and still having a laptop.  


The 2400c was a favorite for size and weight while traveling.  


I now run a 12 inch Powerbook but just did not want to see this 2400c
go to surplus and scrapping.   

Any thoughts welcome.
