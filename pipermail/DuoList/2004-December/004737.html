<PRE>OK, fellow Duo listers and Powerbook listers,

I have tried and tried to puzzle out why I can't get my Duo270C on the web, 
so now I come to request assistance.

Remote Access is in the Control strip. If I go to it and click Connect, 
there's no response. If I open Remote Access and click Connect from the 
dialogue box, I hear a brief click and I get a box saying, 'The Connection 
Attempt Failed. The port may be in use by another application. Check for 
other uses of the port, like a fax receiving software. Also check AppleTalk 
and Modem control panels that they are not using the same port.'

The protocol under Remote Access options is set to PPP. The system is 
running OS 7.6.1. If I go to the Config PPP Control Panel, I get a PPP Down 
message. Port name is set to Internal Modem. If I click Open, I get an error 
indicating 'The Serial Port that was selected to be used by PPP seems to be 
in use by something else. If AppleTalk is active, it may be using this 
serial port preventing PPP from using it.'

If I go to the AppleTalk Control Panel, it tells me 'AppleTalk is currently 
inactive....' I tell it No to the activate AppleTalk question, so AppleTalk 
is off.

The extensions I see loading that look like they might be relevant are:

OpenTPTAppleTalkLib, OpenTPTInternetLib, OpenTransportLib, Open TPT 
AppleTalk Library, Open TPT Internet Library, Open Transport Library, 
OpenTPT Modem 68K, OpenTPT Remote Access 68K, OpenTPT Serial Arbitrator, 
EtherTalk Phase 2, Internet Config Extension, Network Extension, PPP, and 
Remote Only.

The modem is internal, and is set in the Modem Control Panel as Connect Via: 
Internal Modem, and Modem: Global Village X2. Startup Items is empty. The 
TCP/IP Control Panel has Connect via PPP, Configure Using PPP Server, and 
the Name Server addresses my ISP specifies.

Now, given the Fax advisement, the machine does have Global Village's 
GlobalFax FaxCenter installed, but I can't find a way to turn it off, or 
even check to see if its turned on. It's not launching at Startup, and I'm 
not running it before trying Remote Access. If I open it and go to FaxCenter 
- SetUp - Receiving to see if there's some automatic 'listening' turned on 
or some such, I just get the Ding noise and no dialogue box.

This machine was bought used, so I haven't installed everything on it and 
don't have a solid basis to evaluate what should or shouldn't be removed or 
uninstalled. I had a 280C and tried to install OS 7.5 new from diskettes 
after wiping the hard drive, but got an error during the install and was 
unable to complete the OS installation. Got the same error when re-trying 
the same thing on a Duo230C. So my favored course of action, to install from 
scratch so I know exactly what's on the machine, did not prove workable.

Any help would be very much appreciated, I'd really like to get this machine 
up on the Internet to read mail and web browse!

Please cc: any reply to '<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/duolist.html">270C at ev1.net</A>' so I can be sure to get it. Thanks!

Richard
