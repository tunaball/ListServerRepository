<PRE>Ralph and Josh,

Thanks for your replies.

It sounded like something more serious than that, so that's good to know!

I'm still debating whether to open it up (also whether to do it 
myself) -- but if I do, I will test them as you suggest.  I once got 
to watch Chuck Goolsbee doing this, when I was out visiting the west 
coast and he helped me with a previous 2400 of mine.

As it happens, the past two days my 2400 is behaving much better.  It 
only takes a couple of attempts before it starts up, and then it 
seems to be working perfectly (aside from the display issue.  More 
about that below.).  I'll keep starting it up and using it some over 
the next few days, and see how it does.  Is it possible that it was 
in such bad shape the other day (repeated trouble starting up, and 
also turning itself off repeatedly) simply because it hadn't been 
used for couple of years?  Trying to recall the history of this 
particular 2400, I am pretty sure that it did not have any other 
problems besides the display problem when I stopped using it and put 
it away almost three years ago.

The display problem:
It appears like a white horizontal band going across the screen (the 
location and size varies; sometimes it is quite white and sometimes 
it is more spread out and foggy looking and you can see through it). 
Even though the desktop is still visible through and on either side 
of the band, the image of the desktop is frozen (but the computer 
isn't frozen).  In other words, you can move the cursor around and 
click on things -- but you just can't _see_ that you're moving it and 
clicking on things, because the display doesn't update.  The quick 
fix is squeezing the frame on the left side of the display:  the 
white band disappears and the desktop springs to life, updating to 
show what's currently going on.

While I've been using the computer the past few days, I've kept a 
clamp attached to the frame, and the display looks completely fine 
when the clamp is attached(but I'm not satisfied with that as a 
solution!).

How hard is it to get to those connections?  I have good illustrated 
step-by-step instructions for taking apart the 2400 for installing 
memory and G3 card , but not for getting to the display cables or 
replacing the display. (I actually have a whole new lid, complete 
with display, that could be installed if necessary).  Has anyone ever 
come across good take-apart/repair/installation instructions for the 
display?

Susanna

PS As I'm going through my old duo and 2400 things, I know I will 
find a bunch of things to give away.  Eventually I will post a list 
of these, but here is one thing I already know that I'd like to give 
away: a Bookendz Docking Station for 2400.  Anyone want it?
</PRE>
