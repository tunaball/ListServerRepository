<PRE>At 08:40 AM 4/30/2006, Gary F. Daught, had this to say :

&gt;<i>Greetings. I have a PowerBook 2400c, running OS 8.6. I have a Dell
</I>&gt;<i>TrueMobile Gold wireless pc card (that supports 128-bit WEP
</I>&gt;<i>encryption), running ORiNOCO driver v.7.2. I am successfully running
</I>&gt;<i>wireless on my secure network at home.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My college, however, recently switched to a secure (closed) wireless
</I>&gt;<i>network that utilizes certificates, 802.1x authentication and PEAP
</I>&gt;<i>(Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol). I am no longer able
</I>&gt;<i>to access the network with my current hardware/software
</I>&gt;<i>configuration, and am definitely sensing the limits of my trusty 2400
</I>&gt;<i>in this environment. The college is not a Mac-friendly environment in
</I>&gt;<i>general, though I have successfully assisted students with PowerBooks
</I>&gt;<i>and iBooks running OS X and AirPort to get on this closed network
</I>&gt;<i>with little problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I know AirPort support was introduced with OS 9. But I don't know
</I>&gt;<i>whether my TrueMobile card is supported within AirPort. It may be
</I>&gt;<i>time to jump into the 21st century...once the non-Pro version of the
</I>&gt;<i>Mac Book is released. But before I bail, I was wondering if there is
</I>&gt;<i>a known work-around, third-party utility, firmware update, etc. that
</I>&gt;<i>would enable me to join this closed network with these added layers
</I>&gt;<i>of security/authentication?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks for your assistance.
</I>

         I started with Orinoco WaveLAN silver cards before I was 
able to obtain a real AirPort card for less than $100.

         Any ways, using the Orinoco card and the AirPort 1.3 files, 
I was able to utilize the card. It's been a while but I think even my 
MacOS 9 saw the Orinoco as an AirPort card. I'd have to reboot my 
Pismo out of Linux and into 9 to check that (can't at the moment as I 
am updating my Linux). Any ways, the card should work for you as an 
AirPort card with at least AirPort 1.3. That being said, I don't 
think that version had support for the security features/functions 
listed above. Only one way to find out though and that is to give it a try. :)
         The following website is where I found out I could use my 
Orinoco on my 3400's as an AirPort card.

         Good luck! Let us know how it turns out.
