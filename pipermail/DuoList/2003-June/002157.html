<PRE>
Hello All,
   I have owned a few 2400c
Powerbooks, and I had One that
&quot;gloded&quot;
in what seemed to be fatally.
It was a franken 2400 made up
of spare parts.

   I had fixed a lister's
2400 a few weeks earlier by
swapping out the
processor for one that I  had
. She had brought along a
friend that had suggested the
board couplings might just
need to be re-seated
and that this was possibly the
reason for the Glod. So we
took apart the 2400
and put it back together, to
no avail.
  My theory has always been
that the 2400 adapter is
actually one of the main
culprits of most of the 2400
glods.
   Since the Franken 2400 was
of no real value on the
market, I took it apart
and re-assembled it , the
problem was solved. It still
works today, although
it's motherboard needs to use
an external drive as the HD
bracket was removed
by  an over zealous
technician, but all of you
know that story.

I am actually working on
getting it going to see if the
I/O board works for someone
who needs it.
All I need is an external hard
drive and I'll know for sure.

    I guess what I'm trying to
say here is that:
&#149; the 2400 Glods for what we
have all seen as different
reasons.
&#149; Sending it to get repaired
for what you can buy another
one for, seems like overkill
&#149;These fixes are sometimes
temporary, and the glod
returns later for no apparent
reason
&#149;Maybe it's time to take a
screwdriver and explore the
insides if you are so inclined

&#149; I've always preferred the
YO-YO adapter to the 2400's
and see this as a way of
avoiding
I/O failure as there are no
kinks in the adapter cord and
this reduces the chance of a
frayed
cord short circuiting the I/O
board.
&#149; Funny how all other
powerbooks that have these
kind of adapters cord
attachment also have sudden
motherboard failures(2400,
lombard, walstreet , 3400...).

&#149; Or maybe it was all planed
by IBM , when they were
producing the 2400 line, you
know !? make
the competition seem
unreliable.
&#149; I don't care what anyone
says, the Glod problem and
it's causes has not been
answered to my satisfaction,
 and I believe that service
centers are sometimes just
re-seating and charging for
full MB replacements.
  Heck , if we didn't have
GLOD, what would we talk
about.

But then again I'm just
paranoid and schitsofrenic,
and maybe I've contracted west
nile or mad cow or worse SARS,
(I live in  Toronto).
Oh and for those of you who
didn't notice , I can't spell
either.

 Kidding aside, if your in the
Toronto area, I'll take a shot
at repairing it if your
interested in dealing with a
nut like myself.


 Cheers
Carlos

P.S.  No small animals were
harmed in this convoluted
contribution to the argument
/advice.
