<PRE>Hi all,

I NEED HELP!!!

I posted months ago with my 2400c problem.  Like many
others I had a shut down when I was surfing the
internet with the machine sitting on a blanket.  After
that it would start, function intermittently and GLOD
whenever it wanted to. Then I would get a BUS error. 
Then it would start and I would get an &quot;not enough
memory error&quot;...then computer would do a forced start
without any extension on...not even enough memory to
run a program or open the control panel.

I changed the 96mg memory module for a new 64mg
module.  No change.

It sounded like a cpu problem to some by my
description.
  
I just replaced the CPU wiht a stock 603 (no Newer).

Now we're making progress.  it will consistantly start
up.  There is no GLOD anymore.  BUT I have the &quot;not
enough memory&quot; error.  The first window says &quot;there is
not enough virtual memory to continue booting witht
the extensions enabled.  Extensions have been disabled
for this boot.  Use the Memory control panel to make
more virtual memory available.  Then the os boots but
a window opens that says the finder doesn't have
enough memory available.  Then my option is to retry
or restart.  Occasionally the HD and trash mounts on
the screen. I cant run anything! The only things I
havent tried is a boot from the cd or changing the
memory back to the 96mb or take it out completely to
see if there is a difference.

Any ideas?  could there be a physical problem with the
ram ( i haven't looked at the solders and don't think
I'd know if there was a problem if I saw it.

I'm trying to avoid sending it in before anyone
suggests DT&amp;T.  I've used them in the past but $200 an
average repair seems a little prohibitive for a dated
laptop even if I can't let it go.

HHHHEEELLLPPPP!!!!
thanks,
paul

PS: If I didn't explain this well enough or anyone has
questions please ask.
