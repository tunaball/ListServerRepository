<PRE>I have my thesis on a 2400c I've had for years. It has
no modem, no disk drive and no CD. There's no way to
get files on or off except through an external ZIP
drive. The zip drive isn't working anymore (just
happened today - why does it always happen when you
need the thing the most?!!). I'm not sure what's
wrong. I click on the &quot;Iomega ZIP drive&quot; icon and the
computer freezes up until I unplug the drive. After I
unplug the drive from the computer, it unfreezes gives
me an error &quot;No Iomega drives available.&quot;

The problem is that I have a 75 page thesis on the
computer that I've finished (well, almost) and I have
to get it off to my professor by tomorrow (it's
already a bit late). I'm thinking of just transcribing
the whole thing from the laptop to one of the
university computers, but that will take all day.

Any suggestions? I was thinking about trying to
connect it to a printer, but I can't load the printer
drivers onto it (no way to get files on or off). The
only drivers it has are what it came with back in '97
or whatever. Also, I don't have the necessary cable.
All I have is one that connects the SCSI Zip to the
laptop.

Any suggestions on how I can get the file off without
transcribing it? According to the help menu, it says I
can use my laptop as a SCSI drive - meaning I can
connect it to another computer's SCSI port and
transfer files - but the help menu is utterly
unhelpful in telling you how to go about doing this.
Any ideas?

The laptop has an infared port. How does that work? Do
they still make laptops with those?

I think I'm going to have to start transcribing.
