<PRE>Hi,

I have a G-3 upgraded 2400 that I just got a couple weeks ago.  I 
used to have just a regular 2400, so I'm really excited to have this 
one -- but I'm worried it is coming down with a display problem

What I first noticed about the display (which generally looks great) 
was just a flicker, or sometimes a fleeting white (horizontal) band 
or two across the screen, when I would adjust the angle of the screen 
(or sometimes when I'd just touch the frame around the screen).  Once 
in awhile it would flicker even without my touching it  (I think, but 
I'm not sure, that this was more likely to occur when running off of 
batteries -- but in any case it occurred rarely).  Sometimes when the 
white bands appeared on the screen (as I was tilting it) they would 
remain until I changed the angle a bit more or just nudged it a bit.

The past few days the symptoms have worsened noticably.  Now when I 
tilt the screen, the white bands regularly remain on the screen after 
I let go,  and they are wider bands now; half or more of the screen 
is often white when this happens.  A couple times the _whole_ screen 
has been affected -- some of it white and on some of it the desktop 
was visible but all bleached-out looking.  Still I can always get the 
screen completely normal again, but it seems to take more persuasion 
than it used to -- several prods or nudges, when it used to take one.

Does anyone recognize these symptoms or have any advice how I should 
proceed?  If I open it up, is there a possible source of the problem 
that an untrained eye (mine) would be able to spot?  (I have just a 
little experience disassembling/reassembling a previous 2400 -- only 
down to the keyboard and ram).  Any simple fixes that would be 
reasonable to try -- like loosening the screws on the hinges or 
anything?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Susanna
