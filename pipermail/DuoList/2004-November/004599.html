<PRE>Dear List members,

I recently purchased a duodock 1 not the plus nor the 2 just the first 
one. Since purchasing it I have been trying to find information, some 
of it rather obscure and hard to find. I was rather disappointed by the 
lack of good information on the net. Indeed we can easily find PDFs on 
taking one apart, service manuals and such, needless to say these are 
an invaluable resources and a god send that they are available. A good 
start for anyone needing to decipher the duodock.

My duodock, doesn't have the optional hard drive nor the 68882 
coprocessor, not even the extra VRAM, all of it rather mysterious to 
me. I am sure there are others in the same boat or others that will be. 
Even the right monitor can be a risky purchase, which brings to mind 
the question of an adapter or suitable cable, you know db15, dsub15, 
lingo I have yet to master. It's always nice to attach a new monitor 
instead of relying on older tubes which likely have a limited future 
life span. The right ethernet adpater card can also be a looming 
question mark for some of us. I still don't know what to get. Oh and 
what about an 040 processor card, will they work, can they work, do we 
need a PDS slot or is NuBus enough?

Wouldn't it be great to find a site devoted to all these questions? I 
would like to propose to the community a site dedicated to the duo, the 
'revived duo'. Now I know many of us still use and love our duos but 
beyond that many of us just want one but need the technical issues 
ironed out.

Just today someone was so nice to put up a link to the scsi cable and 
all the necessary folds. That was absolutely wonderful to see. I for 
one am in the market for an internal scsi drive and almost spent money 
on a cable that probably would be shelved. Thanks for the scsi cable 
images!

****

Would anyone here be into making a website, even a simple site with 
images showcasing the innards of a duo and some of the necessary 
components and optional installations for networking, for attaching a 
modern monitor, for getting the drive installed, for building a 
powercable for the hard drive, etc? I have access to a good digital 
camera but can't code html effectively. If someone here is willing to 
cooperate I can take pictures of what I have and together we can build 
a decent duo site.

Perhaps others can offer other pictures of cards and the respective 
software. This will both enrich our duo community and reactivate it.

I would love to get your feedback and hopefully something can come out 
of this post.

I appreciate the time you have taken to read this and hope there will 
be positive feedback.

since signing up to the list on September 13 a whopping 59 messages 
have been posted by the members, seems like a small number but then 
again it may be right. Who knows.

I hope to here from as many of you back as soon as possible.


Sincerely,
Alex Santos

</PRE>
