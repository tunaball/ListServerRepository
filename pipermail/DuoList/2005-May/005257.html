<PRE>	When it starts acting buggy for me like that I do one of two
things...

	1) Run Disc First Aid... file structure might need repair.
	2) Reinstall the OS.  

	On my DSL network I'm running the TCP/IP on Ethernet/DHCP or
automatic.

	Let me know how it goes.

	BTW, currently running 9.1 on my 2300c for iTunes.  My
experience in all this was 8.6 was perhaps the best.  If I could have
gotten the iTunes patch to work I would have stayed there.  Something to
think about.

Subject: [DuoList] 2300c ethernet setup

Hello list,

I'm trying to get an old 2300c (running 7.6.1) net-worthy for a kid.  It

doesn't have a modem, but I do have one of those micro etherdocks.  It's

been a long time since I've worked with System 7, but I remember this 
being dead simple back in the classic MacOS days - just plug in 
ethernet, make sure TCP/IP is getting a dynamic address, and you were 
set.  (Ironically, setting up a modem was more work, but since I did it 
more often I could probably get that done quicker.)

The problem is that TCP/IP only gives me the option to use MacIP, 
whatever that is.  (Some kind of AppleTalk networking?)  I reinstalled 
the networking bits since the Duo's been lying around and I couldn't 
remember how it was configured.  PPP briefly appeared as an option, and 
I set the netmask, et al.  But as soon as I tried to save that 
configuration I got an error, and the PPP option disappeared again.

What can I check?  I've never really used notebooks that much, but I do 
know they have some special control panels that I might not be familiar 
with.  I need to have this info soon because I only have two more nights

to work on this before I give the machine away!  It's still a nice 
little machine, and I'd like to get it in useful condition.

Thanks,
Tim
