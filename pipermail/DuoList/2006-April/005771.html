<PRE>Greetings. It has been a while since I posted to DuoList, so I  
thought I would update all on my recent pursuits. The home network is  
now entirely wireless. The last cable was detached from the router  
after I got a TrendNet wireless print server for our Brother laser  
printer. Works great in a mixed (and secured) network of three  
desktop Macs, and a PC my wife is forced to use for her work.

My PB2400c (OS 8.6) has been running nicely on the network for  
sometime now too, with a Dell TrueMobile (ORiNOCO) Gold pcmcia card  
(my 'book is not CardBus enabled). But I was very excited to discover  
that I could access the laser printer wirelessly from my 2400! With  
AppleTalk enabled, I selected Generic PostScript Printer from the  
LaserWriter 8 software, and pop! the printer appeared right away!  
 From the Chooser, I select LaserWriter 8 and making sure AppleTalk  
is enabled, the printer also appears right away! This is a very nifty  
experience!

I think in a previous post, I mentioned that I am booting directly to  
a 1GB CF memory card with ALL my commonly used apps also installed (I  
have RAM Doubler there too, in case I ever bump against my 80MB of  
physical RAM limit). I even took the step of removing the System from  
my hard drive, which I use for storage only! So, I'm running silently  
except when initial boot (and the occasional app) accesses the hard  
drive. Battery life is extended significantly! What a great machine!

The only question I have is wondering if there is a way to cope with  
an incomplete waking from sleep condition when the wireless card is  
installed? It seems pokey on wake-up generally. But if I have it  
sleeped for any length of time I can wake-up the screen and spin the  
hard drive, but all I get is a gray display. I wait and wait and  
nothing happens. I end-up having to force a restart (with Cmd-Ctrl- 
powerkey). Ideas? Related in anyway to the fact that I don't have a  
System on the hard drive?
