<PRE>Hi.  I'm needing to get rid of my old computers, so i'm looking for a 
good home for a Duo 2300c too, and all its accessories, Duo Dock II, 
mini Dock, SCSI adapter, floppy drive, cables, wet suit case, two 
batteries, battery charger, also Stylewriter 2200 printer with 
cartridges in sealed wrappers (but probably dried out) and all 
cables, manuals, software on floppies, original receipt, Applecare 
protection plan, etc.

I put it up for sale on Craigs list several months ago, asking $35 
and a guy was going to buy it, but on the phone he asked me to power 
it up and it wouldn't power up.  He said he still wanted it, i was 
happy to give it to him for free, he said he thought it just needed a 
clock battery.  But i've not been able to find where to get a clock 
battery.

Yesterday i left it off at a local place called Mac911 and they are 
doing to try to power it up so i can get my data off it, such as it 
is, or if necessary they would open it up and take out the hard drive 
and copy my data to a DVD.  $99.  Then, i am planning to donate it to 
one of two people who are interested, they are both out of state, 
they are mac collectors.  They will pay for shipping.

Does anyone know where i would get a clock battery?   The Mac911 guy 
said he didn't have any way of ordering one.  Nor did anyone on the 
Apple Discussion forums.

Judy

</I>&gt;<i>2300 with a 210 screen?  LOL!  That's what I did to make mine smaller

</I>&gt;<i>Hey guys,
</I>&gt;<i>It's been ages since I've booted up my first laptop a Duo 210 upgraded 
</I>&gt;<i>to a 2300. Heck, it's probably been over 3 years.
</I>&gt;<i>And while I'd love to hang on to my first laptop ever, I simply don't 
</I>&gt;<i>have a use for it anymore that my 2400c can't do.
</I>&gt;<i>So I'd like to find it a new home where somebody might take good care 
</I>&gt;<i>of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Stuff:
</I>&gt;<i>Duo 2300 with a 210's screen. 28mb ram. 2gb HD. System 8.5 loaded. 
</I>&gt;<i>Booted up today. All the batteries are dead I think.
</I>&gt;<i>Duo Dock II, according to the tag in the front.
</I>&gt;<i>Apple Minidock
</I>&gt;<i>Floppy drive
</I>&gt;<i>I might have an ethernet dock or some small one, don't remember.
</I>&gt;<i>Stack of manuals.
</I>&gt;<i>A few power adapters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anybody interested? You'll have to pay shipping though; I think I can 
</I>&gt;<i>ship anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>-Hansel
</I></PRE>
