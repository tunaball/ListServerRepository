<PRE>PowerBook 2400c + accessories-check out:
<A HREF="http://www.farm-boy-navy-pilot-airline-captain.com/pb2400c_access.jpg">http://www.farm-boy-navy-pilot-airline-captain.com/pb2400c_access.jpg</A>

The PowerBook has been babied and is in perfect cosmetic condition. It 
was sequentially upgraded from the original RAM configuration to 80 MB 
to the current 112 MB. I have the 64 MB card available. I have never had 
the courage to open it up myself and all of the work I have ever had 
done to it has been performed by Kevin Yuhas at MCE in Irvine, CA.

The original processor was upgraded to the NewerTech G3/240 about 3 
years ago, at the same time the original 1.2 gig drive was replaced with 
an IBM (Apple ROM) 10 gig about 18 months ago. The 10 gig did not last 
very long, crashing last fall and I sent it back up to MCE for a drive 
replacement.

Since having retired from my 30 year airline career and not needing a 
Road Warrior any longer, I forgot about it for a while and It just came 
back this week. Kevin put in a new IBM 3.4 drive because I had the 
feeling that a 10 gig drive was too much for this platform. It starts 
right up and runs just like new, but since I don't really need a Road 
Warrior any longer, I contemplate letting someone else get some joy out 
of it. But like old friends, I hate to part with it.

I am throwing this up against the List to see if anyone is interested in 
making offers. E-mail me off List. Don't be insulted I if choose not to 
acknowledge a low-ball offer, because I don't need -or want to sell my 
little buddy that badly. I know what all the 
parts
 are worth -and many 
times folks don't want to pay for the sum of the parts. If I really 
wanted to get rid of it, it would be up on eBay &lt;g&gt;

PowerBook 2400c:
112 MB RAM (96 MB module)
3.4 Gig hard drive
NewerTech G3/240 Processor
AC Power adapter
Battery (indeterminate condition-seems to hold a normal charge)
floppy disk drive

Extras:
64 MB RAM module
NewerTech Bookendz Docking station
ReNO AC/DC portable CD drive (plug in or batteries) + with carrying case 
and assorted SCSI cables to connect the PB to external drives (50-pin) 
and the ReNO CD-ROM
3 additional hard drives, of indeterminate use:
10 Gig
4.32 Gig
812 MB
spare battery (indeterminate condition)
SCSI Dock plug (use PB as external HD on DeskTop)
GV PCMCIA 56K Ethernet/modem
3COM US Robotics 56k modem PC card
