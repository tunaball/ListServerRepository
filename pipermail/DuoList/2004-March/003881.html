<PRE>Donald, I have to admit I'd forgotten how fast 7.6.1 was until I had to 
use it on my Centris 650 a few months ago.

That said, I'm not sure I'd put that much money into the 2400, given 
your usage, i.e., used to make a living.

Like Mike suggested, an iBook running OS 9.x would seem to offer 
similar speed, a common interface and much better integration and 
longer life with new apps, battery life, etc.
Heck, I'd buy the iBook and keep your 2400 as a backup.

Alternatively, if you can find a G3/320 machine, it's probably already 
got a big drive and max RAM(like mine)...buy it, and just sell yours.

In your case I wouldn't pay more for the G3/400, mostly because it runs 
hotter and you don't need the performance gain, which is minimal.

You can tell I don't make my living writing, but that's my 250 bytes. 
;-)

Cheers...
