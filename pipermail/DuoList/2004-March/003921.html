<PRE>&gt;<i>Just curious. You probably get this a lot, Nick but
</I>&gt;<i>are you the same Nick Lowe, the musician who was once
</I>&gt;<i>a member of Rockpile and produced the early albums of
</I>&gt;<i>Elvis Costello?
</I>
Well, yes, I do get this a lot, but there are plenty worse people to 
be mistaken for. (Punch cartoon from the 70s, man addressing woman at 
party: &quot;Well, as far as I'm concerned, I AM the Frank Sinatra.&quot;) But 
sadly, I'm no relation to anyone talented. I vividly remember the 
first time a school chum said, &quot;Hey, guess what, there's a guy in 
Brinsley Schwartz has the same name as you!&quot; &quot;Ha-ha-ha-ha!&quot; I 
laughed. &quot;Trying to cash in on my famous name; one day they'll be 
asking him if he's THE Nick Lowe...&quot; Three decades later later, the 
jammy bastard still hasn't gone away. Still, I take consolation in 
the fact that if I was him I'd have to be 55 years old, grey and 
weathered, weighed down with riches, universally adored, related to 
Johnny Cash, still basking in critical glory from the best album of 
my career... Hang on a minute. Still, I bet he hasn't got as many 
Duos.

I have to warn you there's a lot of us about; I still occasionally 
get e-mail meant for the photo-collage artist, a divorced father 
featured in a TV documentary about the Child Support Agency, the 
defeated Natural Law Party candidate for Wrexham, and (most 
frequently) a Thai Buddhist monk from Wigan, Lancs on whom there 
seems to be some kind of bounty. (So far as I know these are separate 
people.) I live in daily expectation of fan mail for the character at 
the end of The Sot-Weed Factor.

Inicidentally, if you have my less famous namesake's rather wonderful 
last album, the joke about Indian Queens is that Indian Queens is in 
Cornwall. (If you don't, it's ok to scratch.)


Nick (the Unconvincer).
