<PRE>About browser crashes--

&gt;&gt;<i>Unless someone has a brilliant solution, only advice I can offer is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>trashing the &quot;MacTCP DNR&quot; file out of the system folder whenever 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>things get a bit unstable, and quiting from iCab whenever I have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>finished using it.
</I>
&gt;<i>I've been doing this for a while now, and things have
</I>&gt;<i>been going much more smoothly. iCab still crashes
</I>&gt;<i>occasionally if I interrupt a download or something,
</I>&gt;<i>but it works fine as long as I just let it go through
</I>&gt;<i>its paces. Thanks for the help, Marc!

Peter,

iCab must have seen me writing to you - just after that have had a 
rash of iCab, Explorer and Eudora spontaneously crashing. Seems to 
get to this about every few months.

I assumed there might also be a corruption of the current 
communication settings, so decided on trashing them too for a real 
clean sweep. But before doing so, noted the settings on paper, and 
saved them physically by exporting to another folder. Then did all 
the trashing, restarted, and re-entered as necessary. (Two or three 
minutes in total.)

To do that, from the &quot;Remote Access&quot; control panel menus I opened up 
the Configurations panel for it and for both Modem and TCP/IP panels. 
First write down the details, then export all the separate configs to 
a new folder as a backup - you can always bring them back if things 
go pear-shaped. Possibly worth backing these up, too, at some point. 
If you've got a bunch of different configs for each like I have 
(office, road, home, France, Australia type thing) one folder with 
separate folders within for &quot;Remote Access&quot;, &quot;TCP/IP&quot; and &quot;Modem&quot; 
might simplify rebuilding at a later date.

Then delete the following from the Preferences folder:

- Internet Preferences
- Modem Preferences
- Remote Access (whole folder *)
- TCP/IP Preferences

- iCab's whole cache folder, in preferences folder **
- Explorer's cache in &quot;MS Internet Cache&quot; folder


- and of course the original &quot;MacTCP DNR&quot; form the System Folder

Restart, do a little quick typing back in of the three configs areas, 
and begin with rather a fresh slate!

* suspect the ever growing &quot;Remote Access Log&quot; in here, may have been 
the cause of some problems back when I let my system partition fall 
very low on memory.

** seem to remember someone saying they trash this on a daily basis.

Marc
