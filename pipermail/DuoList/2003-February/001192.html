Such a PB case crack is a perfect application for ProWeld solvent. I've 
fixed a &quot;Whole Bunch (tm)&quot; of similarly cracked PB cases. One drop 
between the cracked bits, lightly clamped together overnight, results in 
a nearly perfect repair. I've used paper clips, clothes pins, a wrap of 
some fine copper wire, etc. to clamp the parts together.

It helps to have _all_ of the plastic, but if some bits are missing I've 
fabricated spare scraps from junked PB shell into suitable replacements. 
One good example is the ubiquitously broken hooks in front of a Duo's HD, 
a little straight bit of PB ABS plastic bridging the hook's remaining 
sides makes a fine repair. Any gaps between parts have zero strength, so 
the better the fit, the stronger the repair. Best case scenario has the 
original bits/shards/parts, which then of course fit together perfectly.

ProWeld is a solvent, very similar to the stuff used for 'gluing' ABS 
plumbing pipe together. I've not used the plumbing stuff on any PB ABS 
plastics, but the ProWeld is certainly cheap enough. I got several 
bottles for ~$3.00 each from Tower Hobbies, but I think lots of hobby 
suppliers carry it.

I've become somewhat evangelical bout the darn stuff, I had given up hope 
of being able to repair PB plastics until I found ProWeld.  &lt;G&gt;  Oh, and 
once you have used it, you'll start looking around and you'll see all the 
other things around made of ABS and similar plastics with cracks to 
repair (eg: electronic equipment, appliances, automobile trim, toys, 
more, more, more...)
