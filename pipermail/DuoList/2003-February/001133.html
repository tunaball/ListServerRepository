<PRE>Hello, I am new to the list (5 minutes :-)

I volunteered to help a friend set up a 2400c by reformatting his hard drive
and removing the Japanese system that is currently on it.  This was the
beginning of what has proven to be a very frustrating experience.  I've used
Macs for as long as I can remember and am very comfortable with them and
enjoy digging into the system and having fun.  Anyway with that said, I have
to admit I didn't know much about this model.

It certainly is cool though.  Now that I have worked with it for the past
four days, I've discovered that it has a 6GB hard drive which appears not to
be the standard, a 320Mhz processor which I'm almost positive wasn't specd
on this machine and 80Megs of RAM.

First, I'm wondering how to confirm whether or not the card bus upgrade has
been performed? (question #1)

Also, I speak and read Japanese so using the system that is currently on the
machine (9.1 J) is not a problem but my friend who does not and just bought
this machine at a local pawn shop because he always hears me raving about
Macs would really like to be able to make some good use of it.

I figured I would connect to my Powerbook (Pismo 500Mhz) via the IrDA port
and use file sharing to transfer an English system (I know it will take
forever but I'm on vacation so that's ok).  Anyway, I got the two (my Pismo
and the 2400c) to communicate once and transferred only a bootable floppy
because I was going to repartition the hard drive first.  It's currently set
up with 3 partitions! (on a 6 gig drive?)  I then realized that if I
repartition I will lose the ability to network using the IrDA and will be
stuck.  The 2400 has a floppy drive but that's it.  No CD.

After figuring out how to get the thing to reboot from the hard drive
(changed to floppy using HD set up and then didn't have a copy of the
control panel on the floppy - had to zap the PRAM) I can't get the two
machines to share anymore????  The IrDA control panel says they are
connected and I have IrDA selected in AppleTalk and file sharing is on,
drives shared etc. but no go.... When I go to the chooser and click on
AppleShare I see nothing nothing nothing.  I've tried everything I can think
of.

Sorry for such a monster long post as such a new member but I'm getting
desperate.  Maybe I'll just buy the machine from him before I go back to
Japan (currently in Hawaii) and take my time and have fun with it.

Anyway basically I asked two questions

#1 How to determine if Card Bus upgrade has been performed?
#2 Any hints on how to get IrDA networking to work?

Thanks in advance to anyone who has any advice.

Jason
