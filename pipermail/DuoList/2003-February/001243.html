<PRE>Helen,

These batteries can be rebuilt, but it is a somewhat complicated
process and a little expensive.  (Buying new NiMH cells to replace
the &quot;tired&quot; ones in your battery pack can cost about $50.00.  If
you have to add the cost of low-temperature solder, a soldering
iron and heat sinks, that bumps it up to $80 or more.  To that
you must add about 3-4 hours of labor at a minimum.  In other words,
its not really feasible for most of us.

Another alternative is to try to &quot;zap the dendrites&quot;, which
can rejuvenate some cells for a time by getting the electro-
chemical processes inside the NiMH cells going again.  But
I believe this effect can be short-lived.  Perhas someone else
who has zap her or his batteries would care to comment.

Finally, you can buy another battery.  They are available on
a sporadic basis on eBay.  Be careful and buy from a trustworthy
seller who has actually tested the battery extensively and can
vouch for its functionality.  Otherwise, you may had two worthless
batteries instead of just one.  Or you can buy a relatively new
battery from a retailer.  I do not believe BTI continues to
manufacture their Duo line of batteries, but I did spot a
BTI &quot;Type IV&quot; battery at an online retailer:

Laptops are great for their portability, but only as long as
one can renew the batteries when they conk out.  Unfortunately,
it is getting to be harder and harder to do for our Duos.

Hope this helps.

Robert
