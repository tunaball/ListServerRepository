<PRE>I just got an Asante NetDock (part of a 280C package) and had no luck 
getting it to work with either that 280C or with one of my 2300s. The 
hardware was visible and OK to the test utility but the 'Book  was unable 
to see or use any driver. I tried Asante installers v5.29 and v5.61 
without success.

I scanned my 2.5 years worth of Duo-list digests and found no solutions 
there at all. Sigh, well there goes all hope, right?

Hey hey, I'm pleased to report I just got it working on my 2300/56/9.1! I 
had previously been using a scsi-dock with an Asante Micro-EN/SC. Which 
of course means the EN/SC driver was installed into my System file. On 
the off-chance the installer (v5.6.1) didn't correctly replace that 
driver with the NetDock driver, I used Resedit to delete the EN/SC driver 
myself (System: DRVR #28 &quot;ENETO&quot;) from a System file _copy_, plus I moved 
the EN/SC extension to the (disabled) folder. The EN/SC driver was ~17K 
iirc, while the NetDock driver was much smaller (~4k?), both were plugged 
into the same DRVR #28 spot. Obviously, you can have only one of these 
per System file, but since I saved the original System I can use either 
NetDock or EN/SC by swapping System files when needed. 

Then I rebooted with extensions off and ran the installer again. Wierdly, 
for &quot;Easy Install&quot; it offered to install the EN/SC driver, however by 
selecting &quot;Custom&quot; I was able to select the NetDock driver (only!) for 
installation which it appeared to do without complaint.

Bingo, on restart I had a DHCP address and an actual TCP/IP connection. 
Oh Happy Day!

Just before I found this NetDock, I bought a couple of Micro-EN/SC 
adapters with the idea of installing one internally into a 2300. Now? 
Hmmmmmmm, still would be tres cool to have an RJ-45 jack back there 
instead of the useless-to-me modem, but seems like a bit of a bother now 
I have the NetDock. Anyone else done the Micro-EN/SC internal install? 
Are there any dos and don'ts I should watch out for should I give it a 
go? The only notion I have so far is to lay the Micro-EN/SC's PCB on top 
of the HD (9.5mm of course), as there just ain't room for it where the 
modem card lives.

Well anyway, I hope the NetDock info helps someone out there (either now 
or future), :-)
