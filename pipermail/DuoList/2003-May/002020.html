Let's agree on terms here. You boot from a floppy, not to it. From a 
floppy, from a hard drive, from a CD-ROM...

&gt;<i>Keeping in mind that I am
</I>&gt;<i>reporting all of this third hand - friend of the kids... - I believe
</I>&gt;<i>what I was told was that they ran the disk first aid from the floppy,
</I>&gt;<i>and then I believe the  new system folder was copied to the hard
</I>&gt;<i>disk, but even then, the system would not boot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Starting up (booting) the 280 from the floppy proves that the minimal 
System Folder they have on that floppy works fine starting up the 
machine. Copying that System Folder to the internal HD does not 
necessarily mean it is adequate to start up from the internal HD though. 
For instance, the internal HD may have problems that are quite beyond 
merely placing a proper System Folder on it. Hence, my question about 
Norton Utilities.

&gt;<i>I need to see if I can get my hands on the machine itself - with all
</I>&gt;<i>the pieces.  I believe they are running MacOS 7.5.1 .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Is there someplace that an owner of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;duo 280 can turn to purchase an appropriate MacOS in a format
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;that they could use to format a hard disk and then install a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;version of the OS on their laptop?
</I>
Drive Setup, among others, will easily reformat the drive from a floppy, 
if you want, but first try to find out what's wrong with the HD or you'll 
be wasting your time. Norton or equivalent will do that.
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Isn't their &quot;OS disk&quot; the one they were able to look around on, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you say above? 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>They were poking around on the hard drive.  When I referenced an &quot;OS
</I>&gt;<i>disk&quot; , I was referring to a CDROM/etc. containing a fresh copy of
</I>&gt;<i>the OS from which they might re-install things.
</I>
Okay, terminology got in the way again. Thanks. Have them start up from 
the floppy again and look in the hard drive's root directory (just 
doubleclick the HD's desktop icon and they're there) to see if there's a 
System Folder (or two?) there in the first place. Try to dissuade the 
youngsters from trying out any clever ideas of their own right now if you 
can. Report back. Progress!
&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There also might still be a salvagable System Folder on it, while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the computer just can't &quot;find&quot; it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>I can check, but I don't think they have a copy of norton disk
</I>&gt;<i>doctor, and I am pretty certain I don't either.  But we can check.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>There are a lot of ways to go here; don't worry. There are many sources, 
including eBay, for old installer CD's, but you may be able to accomplish 
your goal for free.

Apple still offers OS 7.5.3 for free download 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.info.apple.com/support/oldersoftwarelist.html">http://www.info.apple.com/support/oldersoftwarelist.html</A>&gt;. It's an 
unwieldy 19-part download but it can be done. IMO 7.5.3 is an improvement 
over 7.5.1 for every machine I've encountered so far. The OS 7.5.5 
updater is free too.

Important: How much installed (physical) RAM is in the 280? The OS 
versions get bigger as time goes by, so this is good to know, along with 
the capacity of the internal HD. Click once and Get Info on the HD icon 
to find out the latter.
