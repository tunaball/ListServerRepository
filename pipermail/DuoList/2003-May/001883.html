Hello Listers,

This is the bad news. I haven't had much time for emails but monitor this
list from time to time. The G3-400 will stay king of the 2400 upgrades.
Sorry to disappoint, but it wasn't for lack of trying...

(BTW there are PCMCIA wireless combo cards for 802.11b / a / g for the
latest wifi 2400 upgrade)

Hello Sidney:

Coincidentally, I just tried to reach you this morning, and the man who
answered the phone wasn't sure when you would be returning.

Anyway, I'm very sorry I've been so hard to reach. I haven't had much news
for you, I'm afraid. We're over a month behind on a very important project
(the ZIF G4 that we've just announced), and our engineering group is
swamped. We had this project marked as kind of an &quot;open second tier&quot;
activity, but no one has even started evaluating it from a design
standpoint.

With our current schedule logjam on &quot;A list&quot; projects, I doubt seriously
that we will be able to attend to this before the market is gone. You should
probably notify your list that this product is, at best, highly improbable.
I'm very sorry that we've taken a year to decide not to do anything, but we
always like to seriously consider any product with a built-in customer base.
Unfortunately the variables just didn't come together on this one.

Best Regards, 
Karl Seppala

Hi Karl,

I've tried by various phone means to get a hold of you w/o success. I think
you've gotten a few intermittent phone messages. I presume Sonnet is much
too busy on more important projects to trifle with this matter.

Can I inform my &quot;pre-order&quot; list that this project is definitively dead? I
just need your unofficial word that no light of day is forthcoming and then
I'll not importune you further on this matter. I'd like to tell the others
something not based on outside speculation.

Thanks very much.

Best regards,
Sidney Ho
