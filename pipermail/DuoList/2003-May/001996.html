</I>&gt;<i>Well, I worked with some of these this weekend. I got one downloaded,
</I>&gt;<i>decoded.  Then I used disk copy to open the image file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I was not able to figure out how to get Disk Copy to create an image

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Start program with no floppy. Disk Copy will ask you for one.

&gt;<i>However, I was able to drag the system folder and apps into the
</I>&gt;<i>floppy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The kids were able to use that disk to boot up.  They tell me they

</I>&gt;<i>problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>However, running disk first aid from the floppy , they tell me that
</I>&gt;<i>the system still starts up with the flashing floppy icon with a ?.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You say they started up Disk Copy from, I assume, a mounted floppy, and 
could even &quot;look around&quot; the internal hard drive?

And that when they tried running Disk First Aid from the floppy, they 
only saw a flashing question mark? Then maybe the floppy wasn't already 
mounted. 

They need to be able to boot the computer from a floppy disk containing 
DFA. Is that on a different floppy than Disk Copy's? Maybe both programs 
would fit on whatever floppy has a proper System Folder to boot the 
computer.

What machine do they have, and which OS version are you looking to make 
work in it? Please refresh my memory


&gt;<i>Given that they don't seem to have an OS disk, and I know I don't
</I>&gt;<i>have enough space at home to download one, nor a format on which to
</I>&gt;<i>create such a disk for them, is there someplace that an owner of a
</I>&gt;<i>duo 280 can turn to purchase an appropriate MacOS in a format
</I>&gt;<i>that they could use to format a hard disk and then install a new
</I>&gt;<i>version of the OS on their laptop?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Isn't their &quot;OS disk&quot; the one they were able to look around on, as you 
say above? 

There also might still be a salvagable System Folder on it, while the 
computer just can't &quot;find&quot; it.

Before giving up and just going to a complete redo, can you get hold of 
an appropriate vintage of Norton Disk Doctor on floppy? If not, contact 
me offlist.
