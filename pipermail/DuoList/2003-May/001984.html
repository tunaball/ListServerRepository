From: Duo/2400 List [mailto:<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/duolist.html">DuoList at lists.themacintoshguy.com</A>] On Behalf
Of Steve Sharpe

Subject: [Duo2400] just got a duo


Hello, as the title implies, I just became the proud owner of a Duo 
280c over the weekend, so I thought I'd sign up for this list to get 
some information about them.

The machine seems to be in good shape overall, but for two problems.

First, the battery is dead. Can anyone point me in the direction of a 
source for a new battery? How much can I expect to pay for one?

Second, I cannot seem to get online with it. The modem does not seem 
to work. I do not know if this is a hardware or software problem. 
 From the settings that were on the machine when I acquired it, I'd 
say the previous owner had been using an external modem...which makes 
me suspect that the internal one is dead. However, comparing the 
extension set and other software with my powermac 6500, it looks as 
if some of the software for controlling the modem has been deleted. I 
have upgraded to OS 7.5 in hopes that the missing software would be 
reinstalled but that has not happened (without a dock I am limited to 
installing over an Appletalk network, which prevents me from doing a 
complete install).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Congrats on the new Duo! A very cool little machine with a great color
screen.

Hopefully someone else can point you toward batteries (there's always
eBay...), but I wouldn't automatically assume that the use of external
modem means the internal modem is dead. It's probably more likely that
the previous owner just wanted a faster connection than the internal
modem. It's not fast, but probably OK for emergencies or checking email.

It's been a while since I surfed the web with a duo's internal modem,
but it's S-L-O-W when compared to today's technology...

I'd keep trying to troubleshoot the internal modem, if for no other
reason than a backup.

Enjoy your 280c!

David
