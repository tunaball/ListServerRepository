The hardware is a Duo 280.  The problem is that booting to hard disk
results in the flashing floppy icon.

I created a floppy containing a system folder, the hard disk utility,
and disk first aid.

They are able to boot to the floppy. Keeping in mind that I am
reporting all of this third hand - friend of the kids... - I believe
what I was told was that they ran the disk first aid from the floppy,
and then I believe the  new system folder was copied to the hard
disk, but even then, the system would not boot.

I need to see if I can get my hands on the machine itself - with all
the pieces.  I believe they are running MacOS 7.5.1 .

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What machine do they have, and which OS version are you looking to
</I>&gt;<i> make 
</I>&gt;<i> work in it? Please refresh my memory
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Given that they don't seem to have an OS disk, and I know I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;have enough space at home to download one, nor a format on which
</I>&gt;<i> to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that they could use to format a hard disk and then install a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;version of the OS on their laptop?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't their &quot;OS disk&quot; the one they were able to look around on, as
</I>&gt;<i> you 
</I>&gt;<i> say above? 
</I>
They were poking around on the hard drive.  When I referenced an &quot;OS
disk&quot; , I was referring to a CDROM/etc. containing a fresh copy of
the OS from which they might re-install things.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There also might still be a salvagable System Folder on it, while
</I>&gt;<i> the 
</I>&gt;<i> computer just can't &quot;find&quot; it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Before giving up and just going to a complete redo, can you get
</I>&gt;<i> hold of 
</I>&gt;<i> an appropriate vintage of Norton Disk Doctor on floppy? If not,
</I>&gt;<i> contact 
</I>&gt;<i> me offlist.
</I>


I can check, but I don't think they have a copy of norton disk
doctor, and I am pretty certain I don't either.  But we can check.
