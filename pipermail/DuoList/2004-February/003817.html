<PRE>Hi all,

With much anticipation, which has now evolved into trepidation...

I see the new fuse in its little bag and realize how very very small it is.

But I've gone and gotten myself a second soldering iron to attempt
desoldering both sides of the surface mount fuse at the same time. I already
had a parts holder, so I will use it to hold one of the soldering irons,
leaving one hand for the second soldering iron and the other for the
tweezers which will hold the fuse. I never thought I would wish I had a
smaller pair of tweezers...

The guy at the electronics store told me what I might want to do is put a
pool of solder across both bare terminals, then once the new fuse is in
place, heat the pool again and &quot;wick&quot; the bridged solder away. I could not
totally relate to his suggestion, never having attempted such a microscopic
effort.

Does this sound like a plan worth the effort?

What I thought of doing was possibly attempting to solder the new fuse in
place without adding any new solder, or possibly adding tiny drops of the
solder to the new fuse BEFORE placing it, and then simply heating both sides
at the same time again to &quot;fuse&quot; the new fuse in place.

Funny-- he also mentioned &quot;no caffeine.&quot;

Well, not tonight, too much homework. But soon, I will change the fuse or
burn in flames...

BTW, I had to have a minimum order with digikey, so I ordered several of
these little fuses (SMT) and I got both 2 amp and 1 amp. If someone else has
need of one of these little things (and I do mean little!) All it will cost
you is a self- addressed stamped envelope.
