<PRE>Sorry for shouting.

But I can't help gloating a bit.

I brought a &quot;white screen of death&quot; pb 2400 back, due to the kind and
insightful advice offered by more experienced 2400 hands.

A surface mount fuse was suggested as the problem when my pb 2400 went down
after I tried to hook it to a SCSI chain and it died.

I had never tried such a microscopic soldering job, but with a bit of Lyle
Lovett and Lucinda Williams softly soothing my ears and a shot of Jose
Cuervo to sooth my fingers, the job was over in less than a minute.

I was worried I got a &quot;cold&quot; solder job, coz the iron was touching the board
for maybe a half second, and the fuse does sit there slightly crooked and
tilted, but I tugged at it with my tweezers a bit. It seems OK.

And when I made my sign of the cross, and finished my rosary, I plugged her
in, made another sign of the cross and hit the on switch...

I heard MUSIC! Well, a single chord, anyway. So far, so good. I put her to
my ear---

I heard a &quot;whirring sound&quot; and then...

A couple of seconds later-- The unmistakeable sound of hard drive chatter!
Then- A Happy Mac!

About a minute later-- Desktop! Folders!
Finished!!

Thanks to everyone  who replied to my query-- Several people answered, and
each had good advice to give. I hope I can pass it forward.

Regards from Cajunland, South Louisiana, on the Friday before Fat Tuesday--

I'm headed for Mamou tomorrow, where I'll see the real Mardi Gras (hope I
can get into Fred's Lounge...) and then we'll head to Lafayette, catch a
parade there, and end up in Breaux Bridge, for the biggest little Carnival
outside of New Orleans.

Cheers...
Sid
