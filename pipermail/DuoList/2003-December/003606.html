<PRE>     Well, in the spirit of the Christmas season, a waitress in the officer's club here at AAFES (Army / Air Force Exchange Service) had a daughter that wanted a laptop.  I had a Duo 250 I was not using, and I said if her daughter wanted a laptop, this might work well for her.  I brought in the laptop, the young mother loved it, and so did another of her work associates that I have known for years.  She spent an unduly amount of time on the computer, and then asked &quot;You have any more of these?  I need something like this for school.&quot;

      I tried to let her know that the computer was anything but new that I had, being a 280c.  She would not listen to reason.  In the end I realized she was serious.  She wanted to use a 10 year old piece of equipment.  She was enamoured.  I mean, I know why I picked up and fixed up the Duos that I did, but other people?

     Well, with a working battery on the G3 Wallstreet Powerbook and my Newton 2000 neither Duo had seen much action aside from the occational internet browsing via the Router and DSL, and some BBS'ing.  It was then that I realized that maybe this might a good computer for them.  I was really happy for the 280c I had scored from the First Saturday Sidewalk Sale, but I'm sure both Duos will be the love of their new owners.  Gonna miss them.  They were quite cute, very compact, and the dock a wonder idea!

      So maybe this is farewell.  It was a year ago I was towards the end of my time on PC, determined never to look back, and I found a A/V Mac.  I tinkered with it through the help of the A/V Mac list, and soon had it going just as my 1.2 ghz PC died.  I was so mad I returned to Macs once again full time.  (1988-1999 then 2002 onwards...)   And this time, with the Duos I became accustomed to what a Mac laptop with a working battery is like!

      So even while on the G3 laptop with system X, I will still look back on my Duos that made a few people's christmas happier and feel like I need to insert my G3 in some slot somewhere....   ;)

      Take care and thanks for all the help everyone!
