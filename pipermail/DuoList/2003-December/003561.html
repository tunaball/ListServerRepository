<PRE>R. McFarlane made a statement:
I too can vouch for both Supra and USR/3com external
modems. I have two 
2300c's and a 270c and my external 56K USR modem works
great! 
R. McFarlane

If anyone has the time and inspiration to think about
my situation...
I have some questions about using the USR 56k modem (a
Sportster) with my Duo 2300c. I'll try to describe
things completely to give the best information
possible.

I built a hardware handshaking serial cable per the
3Com/USR website. I downloaded a driver file
(usrara.hqx) from 3Com/USR which after unstuffing is
called &quot;U.S. Robotics High Speed&quot; and installed it in
the extensions folder. (There is NO subfolder called
&quot;Modem Scripts&quot;). The 2300c is running OS 7.5.3, Open
Transport 1.1.2, TCP/IP 1.1.2, and Netscape
Communicator/Navigator 4.01 with Mac PPP.

Express Modem software is also installed for the
internal 14.4 modem (that works OK when selected). In
Express Modem control panel I chose OFF when using the
56k external. I also did not select &quot;Use internal
modem instead of modem port&quot;.

The 2300c also has a control panel for config PPP
which allows me to select the external modem and to
set an initialization string, etc. I set the string as
recommended by 3Com for hardware handshaking. When I
opened Netscape, the USR 56k Sportster dialed,
connected and the TD &amp; RD lights were going like
crazy, but the actual speed to download a file or web
page was much slower than the 14.4k modem. In fact it
would not even load one page that loaded fine with the
internal modem.

When I did this, the drivers for the express modem
were still in the extensions folder.

It seems like there should be some way to select the
type of modem I am using other than just internal or
serial port external. (maybe I'm just  used to higher
level software). Is it enough just to have the correct
driver in the extensions folder? Or do I need a
software update of some kind to either the OS or Apple
Remote Access or PPP? (In order to choose the correct
modem/driver) 
I can't tell which ARA I have. If it is 1.0 the 3Com
site said the modem driver might not work with ARA
1.0. I'm not sure if ARA is used for the internet or
if it's just to access a remote LAN. It seems that it
isn't used unless Appletalk is active, which it isn't
when using the modem.
 
Anyway, if you have any suggestions, fire away!
