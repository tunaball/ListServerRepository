<PRE>I'll take a stab here at replying. First, did you enable it yourself or 
was it done by DT&amp;T? It seems if it works sometimes it would less 
likely be mechanical, but that is just my first reaction with time to 
ponder... I know my firewire card (Firewire2Go) works great in my 
self-enabled (via snipping the yellow wires)2400 320/112. I however run 
only system 9.1. I don't have a two system :) system.  I do have an 
Orange micro USB card that I've never been able to get working. Always 
show's up as a generic Icon and does nothing else. Hope someone else 
here will be more help than I have been!

  I wonder if the reason for the silence has been
that everybody else's firewire worked satisfactorily.
	I have tried every possible driver combo on 8.6 and 9.1 and
firewire works - erratically. Usually my card doesn't come up and the
finder quits, or, if I insert on 8.6 before start up, it locks with a 
dark
screen until I remove the firewire card. But sometimes - rarely firewire
works fine on both OS's.
	Ditto - as I finally realized - with my McCally USB card.
	I may have a &quot;Eureka!&quot; and would like to ask your opinions.
	PS two different modem cards work fine.
	Anyway - it occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, my problem is a
mechical one that my computer  (usually) won't read my firewire or usb
cards because my Cardbus was improperly enabled. Sound likely to you?
