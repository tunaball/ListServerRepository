&lt;&lt; HOW did it go 

&quot;quiet and dark?&quot; &gt;&gt;

GOOD question. I left it in on, went into another room for a few minutes, and 
when I came back in - it was dark.

It's still taking power 'cause the light goes on when i hit CAPS LOCK

&lt;&lt;Does it boot up? &gt;&gt;

NO. silent. Nothing. Nada.

&lt;&lt;Is the case cracked? Where? &gt;&gt;

NO external damage at all. Obviously internal bleeding.

&lt;&lt;Can you 

feed external video to another monitor to eliminate the LCD? Can you 

access anything via SCSI Disk Mode or Ethernet?&gt;&gt;


All good questions. Beats me. Definitely beyond my technocapacabilities.


&lt;&lt;Besides, if your Mac repair guy is any good, it should make no 

difference whether you let him or MCE fix it.


One possibility (of a gazillion): you cracked one or more PCB's, or 

unseated the power or CPU cards. The hard drive might have gone paws 

up. Too hard to diagnose without details. But I'll still give you $50 

for it. ;-) &gt;&gt;

This morning, I took it to my Mac guy to diagnose - if not necessarily fix - 
the problem. His first comment after trying to power it up: &quot;This doesn't look 
good.&quot;  
He tried to dissuade me from doing anything to it other than taking out data 
from the hard drive. I told him I'm fond of this critter, had taken care of it 
perfectly for years before its unlucky fall, and wanted to at least know what 
the problem - or problems - are. Then I could decide to fix, or sell with 
full disclosure for parts etc. 

So - we're not ready for that $50 sale just yet...... ;-)

He should let me know tomorrow - will tell y'all more when I know more....

After writing to this list, I spent last night looking on the web for a 
miracle: quick and easy CPU CPR. Turns out that some other people out there on the 
www have also dropped their laptops (models/makes unspecified), but their 
numbers are not very large... we do indeed remain an unlucky (and clumsy) 
minority. 
Has anyone dropped a 2400 and had it survive? Has anyone dropped a 2400 and 
found out that it could never be fixed?
