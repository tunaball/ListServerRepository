</I>This pb 2400, which I have named Lois Lane, is running sys 8.6 When the 
McNally USB card I have is inserted, I get the generic cardbus icon. 
When I went to install the USB card support extension, I got an error 
message saying this machine could not support this software, or 
something like that. I do have the MCE modified extensions that a very 
kind soul on this list sent me a while back when I did a cardbus 
upgrade on one of my other pb 2400s (the yellow wire cutting procedure) 
and of course it's working fine.
This thread at least has confirmed my question about leaving 8.6 on the 
machine. I have a really neat shareware program that allows itunes to 
be installed on 8.6, and since everything else I might want to use 
(like open transport, internet software) works on 8.6, I am going to 
try and leave it.
At first I thought that 9.1 was required in addition to the USB 
extensions.

But that begs another question. Does simply upgrading to 9.1 
automatically install the USB support I'm looking for? (Of course, I 
still don't know if the machine is truly &quot;Cardbus upgraded&quot; yet...)

</I>
I am very reluctant to leave negative feedback-- it always results in 
&quot;you too...&quot; and as we all know, reputation is very important.
I paid about $275 for this machine. It came with 80mb RAM, and a really 
neat bunch of accessories. But the seller has adopted a hostile tone, 
and is claiming complete accuracy on the description of the machine, 
despite the fact that the USB support sys software is not there.

I would assume that when the machine comes back from MCE, it is ready 
for a USB card without installing any additional extensions, software, 
except perhaps for the driver software for the particular card the 
consumer uses. The macnally card came with no software, but I remember 
not having too much difficulty getting it up and running on the other 
machine, the one I call Peyton...

Does anyone have a driver for the MacNally USB card they could send me?

I'm up to four pb 2400s now. I'm hoping that once I get the population 
numbers high enough, they'll start procreating on their own.
