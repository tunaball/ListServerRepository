<PRE>Hi gang,
I recently bought a pb 2400 on ebay; the unit is nice, everything is 
working... except...
The seller advertised it as &quot;carbus upgraded by MCE.&quot; When it arrived, 
I find it is either:
NOT upgraded to true cardbus enablement as I understand it, meaning it 
can now accept USB devices
or,
the seller did not know what they were talking about when they 
mentioned &quot;cardbus upgraded.&quot;(or does, but claims that a cardbus 
upgrade means something different..)

When I discovered that the machine does not seem to be upgraded for 
USB, I contacted the seller, and they said &quot;Yes it was upgraded to 
accept modem and ethernet cards in the cardbus slot&quot;

I wrote back and said that I was pretty sure the pb 2400 could do this 
right out of the box in stock condition...
They wrote back and said basically &quot;well, that's what I meant-- the 
upgrade means it can handle type I, II or III PCMCIA cards.&quot;

That's where it stands now. Am I wrong in thinking that a claim of 
&quot;cardbus upgrade by MCE&quot; means what I think it means? (and hopefully, 
what a majority of list members would confirm) That it should now 
accept USB cards? (and don't quote me on this, but firewire, too?)
ESPECIALLY given the fact that the name &quot;MCE&quot; was slipped into the text 
too...

I don't wish to be an ass, or nitpicking; but I bought this machine 
with the idea it was going to play nice with my USB printer, and I hope 
I am reasonable in thinking anyone else here with any knowledge at all 
with the pb 2400 would think the same thing--
So, I leave it to the list members to either tell me to lay off, and 
stop whining, or say &quot;You wuz robbed!!!&quot;
(I think I paid about $50 or so more dollars than what a stock unit is 
going for these days... It did come with a couple of power supplies and 
a cute wetsuit, but.... it's that USB thing that's itching right now, 
and I just can't get a good scratch going, ya' know?)
