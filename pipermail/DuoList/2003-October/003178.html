<PRE>John,

I can answer only part of your post, and even that only incomplete. Regard
this as one piece in a large mosaic:

I recently bought an iBook to replace my 2400 for various reasons, and I'm
very happy with it. However, I - like many other listas I believe - decided
afterwards to keep my 2400:
* one doesn't get a terrible amount of money when selling it, perhaps
$200-$250 for a stock version if I'm correct
* it runs (different than my iBook) 8.6, which seems much better than 9.2.2
(not comparing with X of course)
* for word processing and email a 2400 will work just _fine_. I even use
Photoshop 3.0.5 on it from time to time
* Glod is a problem and has hit me too. DT&amp;T charged me approx. $180 for a
motherboard replacement. Another thing that can go haywire is the HD.

Based on those 2 cents and the input from Duo listers much more
knowledgeable than me you'll come to your own conclusions. Since your is not
working properly it may come down to a numbers-game.

Good luck in any case,
-tobias.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm new to the list, though I've been lurking for a couple months (since I
</I>&gt;<i> was given a dead Powerbook 2400). Anyway, I spent a few days fiddling with
</I>&gt;<i> it using a borrowed power adapter to see if I could get it to work. I
</I>&gt;<i> followed Sydney's power reset instructions at the Mac2400 page over and
</I>&gt;<i> over, and even opened up the case and unplugged the battery for a while, let
</I>&gt;<i> it discharge completely... whatever I could think to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, somewhere in the midst of that fiddling (maybe after the battery was
</I>&gt;<i> unplugged?) I managed to get it to boot--twice. The first time it booted and
</I>&gt;<i> I must have had the power adapter loose because it went off while the
</I>&gt;<i> extensions were loading. Shortly afterwards I got it to boot and got a
</I>&gt;<i> system error while the extensions were loading. I figured, no problem, just
</I>&gt;<i> reboot w/ extensions off and see what works. But it never booted again. All
</I>&gt;<i> I can get it to do seems to be alternate between the GLOD and the click of
</I>&gt;<i> death.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, my question: is it worth the trouble to do anything to this machine?
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps many of you think 2400's are awesome even though they're ancient,
</I>&gt;<i> but I am thinking compared to the latest Powerbooks. I want minimal to zero
</I>&gt;<i> investment in a six year old computer that has a reputation for being flaky!
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking of a computer my girlfriend can use for word processing and
</I>&gt;<i> maybe email. I know I would have to buy a power supply, probably a floppy
</I>&gt;<i> drive to get the system patched up, and maybe even a battery. Is there a
</I>&gt;<i> bootable CD-ROM drive for the 2400?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those of you who have had dead 2400's, what is the best thing to do with
</I>&gt;<i> them? Should I continue to try unplugging the PRAM battery, or should I get
</I>&gt;<i> the power board replaced? What works? Even if I drain/replace the PRAM
</I>&gt;<i> battery, will it still be flaky unless the power board is replaced? If I
</I>&gt;<i> have to repair it, what would the cost be, whether I did it myself or I sent
</I>&gt;<i> it somewhere?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any advice from you 2400 gurus would be greatly appreciated. Most of the
</I>&gt;<i> resources on the web advocating the 2400 are 3 or more years old and I can't
</I>&gt;<i> make a good judgment with their help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the long post, but I thought it was all necessary :-)
