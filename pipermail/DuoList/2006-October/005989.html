Subject: [DuoList] found a 2400c w/ G3 upgrade -- it has issues

Hi,

I've been combing the list archives and trying things suggested there
-- you folks are a heck of a good resource.  :)  But my machine's
behaving in a way that doesn't seem to _exactly_ match what I've seen
so far, so, here's its story:

.... OMG while I was typing this, it finally booted up! Wow.

(Still gonna post this in case anyone else finds it helpful.)

It came with two batteries and no power adapter, so I used one from a
PB G3 (skinny black brick style, not yo-yo style, but I dunno if that
matters). I couldn't get it to boot up (been trying all day), but I
was getting a sort of &quot;mixture&quot; of the GLOD and the click -- sometimes
there'd also be a sort of truncated startup chime, as though it didn't
have quite enough power to sustain the echoey end of the chime. Weird.

I repeatedly tried various combinations of reset button with and
without power adapter/battery, with and without holding down the
button for 1 minute or more, etc. but the result was always that I'd
get a temporary green light and/or a small speaker click and/or
truncated chime, but never anything more.

I took the whole thing apart, hoping that reseating everything (it has
a NuPowr upgrade and extra RAM) would help. But nothing changed.

Just now, I idly hit the power button, heard the click and truncated
chime, I shrugged and resumed typing this message...and suddenly it
came to life, and seems to be working perfectly!  :)  :)  :)  Dunno
why...all I can say to someone else with a sickly machine is, don't
give up! This PMU thing is completely nondeterministic.

Thanks for all your past posts, they sure help me revive this thing!
