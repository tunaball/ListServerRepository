<PRE>Karsten: Thanks for providing some more information in your note.
I used that to look in the &quot;Sad Macs, Bombs and Other Disasters&quot;
book to see if there was anything that might help explain your
problems. I found this that seems to apply:

&lt;begin quoted text&gt;
Partitions
If you have divided a hard disk into separate partitions (and both
partitions contain System Folders), on most recent Mac models,
you can select which partition you want to use as your &quot;startup disk&quot;
by making the selection in the Startup Disk control panel.

This technique may not work on all Mac models, however. What
happens instead is that the Mac automatically selects one partition
as the startup partition -- usually, the one listed first in 
alphabetical
order -- regardless of what you do in the Startup Disk control panel.
You would think that to switch the default startup partition, all you
would need to do is rename your hard drives appropriately. I have
found this method to be unreliable, however. In general, you can
assume that the preferred partition is the one that appears at the
top of the stack of icons on your desktop, regardless of their names.

If you want to start up from a nondefault partition, and the Startup
Disk control panel doesn't let you do it, you can try several things.
First, your disk formatting utility may have an option that lets you
assign a partition to be the startup partition (Drive Setup does not
have such an option!). If your utility can do it, this is the most 
reliable
method. A quicker method, which almost always works, is selecting
the desired startup partition via a freeware utility from Apple called
System Picker. Just launch it and select the partition you want to use.
(By the way, System Picker modifies your boot blocks. This means
that if you have used any other utility to change your boot block data,
as discussed occasionally in other parts of this book, System Picker
erases those changes. Just so you know.)

If you are still unsuccessful, go to the partition that you do not want
to act as the startup disk, and place the Finder in another folder
(such as in the Control Panels folder). This procedure &quot;unblesses&quot;
the System Folder. Now, when you select the disk in the Startup Disk
control panel, the remaining &quot;blessed&quot; partition should act as the
startup disk. If you really don't care to save the System Folder, you
can even delete it. (If you have two or more partitions, you may have
more work of this sort to do!)

None of these methods is guaranteed. But I have had success with all
of them. Much of the variation in success seems to depend on
differences among disk drivers (see Fix-It # 12). You'll have to
experiment a bit to see what works for you.

&lt;end of book quote&gt;

About some of your other questions:

The original system on the Duo 2300 was either 7.0 or 7.1 if I
remember correctly. It definitely came out well before 7.5.5,
so if you're using that downloaded from Apple's site, it doesn't
need any enabler file to work on the 2300. If you try to use a
flavor of 8.x from your 8600, it may be missing some of the
files required for the Duo - somewhere around the time of OS 8
is when installers that shipped with computers were specific to
those computers. You had to buy the retail version of the OS to
have it work on anything.

As Roger wrote, if you use Norton Utilities to repair a disk, you
need to keep running it again until it finds no more errors. Many
times the first error found covers another error behind it. This
should be described in the NUM manual, some newer versions
had a preference like &quot;repair without asking&quot; that would look for
other errors and fix everything on the first time through. I think
this wasn't added until v4?

Ich habe meine Antwort in Englisch geschrieben, falls noch
jemand dabei etwas lernen kann. War auch einfacher, weil ich
heute zu faul war, alles zu uebersetzen. Wenn Du noch etwas
brauchen solltest, kannst Du mich direkt emailen. Hoffentlich
klappt es noch mit Deinem Duo!
