<PRE>I think the 12&quot; Powerbooks would be more relevant if they could boot 
into 9 because then all of the 2400 troubleshooting techniques would at 
least be relevant. We just had a lengthy discussion about D-O-C-S, how 
is this relevant to an OSX machine regardless of the size? This list 
appeals to me the same way the 68KMLA does, it is a great repository of 
older Mac information, and having my current technology sorted I have 
decided to revisit my roots so to speak.

I haven't checked out the other lists, but the consensus I am getting 
is that they are more impersonal, that happens with a larger group. We 
could always unofficially open this list to the 12&quot;, thus keeping the 
group small (a tongue-in-cheek &quot;you can discuss the 12&quot; Powerbook, but 
only if you still own a Duo or 2400&quot;).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the other sub-notebook Duos. Eric decided to not split the list,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partly as I recall because so many 2400c owners also owned or had

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Duos, keeping that expertise a part of the community. The 12.1&quot; iBook
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arrived after there already was an iBook list [P1] and the original
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iBook was far from being a sub-notebook. But many 2400c owners bought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 12.1&quot; iBooks so it is reasonable that they be considered to be added.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good points, Bill. I think part of the problem that we're facing is 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> this is a &quot;connoisseur's list&quot; -- the Duo and 2400 may be different, 
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> they're both unusual, elegant machines which cost as much or more than
</I>&gt;<i> their larger counterparts that did more out of the box, but which we 
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> bought because we knew they were cooler (and smaller, but that's part 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> cooler too). The Duo was never as popular as the 1xx, and the 2400 is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty rare.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fear I have is that the 12&quot; G4 will be a commodity item, like the
</I>&gt;<i> iBook, and expanding the list to include it will change the feel. Many 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> us may buy a 12&quot; G4 (or have already bought an iBook, as I have), and
</I>&gt;<i> would continue to enjoy talking to each other about our new machines, 
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> we don't want to join the iBook lists because we have found them to be
</I>&gt;<i> unsatisfying in some way (myself included). Personally, I'd love to 
</I>&gt;<i> talk
</I>&gt;<i> about my new 12&quot; here, but I don't want it to turn into the iBook list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not at all xenophobic about new list members. I just want to
</I>&gt;<i> preserve the nature of the list. To me, it almost seems like less of a
</I>&gt;<i> reach to expand it to other unusual Macs (PB 100, 20th Anniversary,
</I>&gt;<i> MacTV, even Cube), because those are all products that stand apart from
</I>&gt;<i> others, and the people who bought them (or are still using them)
</I>&gt;<i> deliberately made the same sort of decisions we did when we bought our
</I>&gt;<i> Duos or 2400's. (I know, we mainly bought our machines for size, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm
</I>&gt;<i> guessing at least some of us wouldn't have bought them if they weren't
</I>&gt;<i> also elegantly and interestingly designed.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I'm not advocating a position here, other than to say that if 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> list DOES expand to include other products, I hope it can do so in a 
</I>&gt;<i> way
</I>&gt;<i> that preserves the collector's interest that we have here.
