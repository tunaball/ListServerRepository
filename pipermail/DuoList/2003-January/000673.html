actually wrote drivers so that you could use it on a Mac, they would

</I>How strange that it doesn't work.

I'm actually hanging onto mine. Occasionally my kids use the PB1400 with the
camera. However I think I bought this one at a Target Store here in Indy for
$10, but that's been a while back...I think. Heck, I buy so much crap I
don't remember where most of it comes from...
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Trade you my airport base station for the G4 :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>OK fine, but shipping's gonna be $800 (and no local pickups!!). No wait!! I
forgot that I'll have to go with the AirPort Extreme! Sorry! ;^)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah.  I'm gonna wait to see how this TiBook goes.  It'll take me
</I>&gt;<i> probably a year to save the money, and hopefully the problems will be
</I>&gt;<i> known and resolved by then.  Either that or they will have killed it
</I>&gt;<i> off and I might get one second hand.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Speaking of waiting, there is one thing that might make me wait a bit
longer. I just read about a new 64-bit, PowerPC 970 processor that IBM is
coming out with. Smaller and less power-hungry than the best G4 and runs at
1.8GHz. I saw it in the February issue of MacAddict. I skimmed through the
article Tuesday so I don't recall details (were the heck did I leave it
laying) but I think they indicated that Apple hasn't publicly committed to
it yet. But if/when they do, there's a good chance it will be in Macs before
the end of the year. If so, it will make for one killer processor for
PowerBooks (they mention a 1.2GHz model).

Damn...why can't I just be happy with what I've got?!?!?!?
