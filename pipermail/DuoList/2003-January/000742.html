I used to be a member of the PowerBook list at Low End Mac. It was a mix of
just about anyone with a PowerBook ranging from the 100 series on up to the
G3s (and some G4s). While the list was rather diverse, it did well up until
the release of OSX.

Eventually the list appeared to be dividing into two distinct groups. People
with OS 7-9 issues and people with OSX issues. Finally a new list spun off
which became the G-Book list, since these were the machines capable of
running OSX. It was a logical transition. While there was some resistance
when it first split, the benefits were quickly realized.

The reason I explain this is because I think it would be a mistake to open
this list up to the new 12&quot; G4s (I don't include the iBooks since you
already have a list for us). There would be two distinct camps that would
rarely be able to offer each other help since the operating systems and
hardware are so distinctly different. While the idea of a list that caters
to subcompact Macs is a cool, I think that it will always be divided by two
very different operating systems.

I still have several Duos but I left the list not long after getting a new
iBook Dual USB. I needed a list that was more focused on the machine I have
so I joined the iBook list which you host (and perhaps it should become the
subcompact list). It was exactly what I need. I still get the Duo list in
digest form though as I enjoy skimming through the older Duo related
messages (and occasionally offer some help).

This list may eventually fade away, but I can't see that happening for some
time now. Too many people come here and stay here to keep their babies
running and share what they learn with others like themselves.

I was on the PowerBook list, G-Book list and Duo/2400 list all at the same
time. Of all three lists, I liked the Duo/2400 list most because I felt like
I was part of a small, close-knit, very unique community. I finally dropped
the PowerBook list but I couldn't bring myself to leave the Duo/2400 list,
which is why I went digest.

I think that if you try do try to open it up, it will lose that uniqueness.
