&gt;<i>So my burning questions:
</I>&gt;<i>Is the 2400c--given the relatively high price and hard-to-find

</I>&gt;<i>work (new mo-bo, new logic board, etc.) how hard it is truly to get repair 
</I>&gt;<i>work done?
</I>
For writing, a 2400c would probably be overkill. They're quite nice, 
however, and for the right price might be worth it.


&gt;<i>Are the Duos too limited for exchanging info if you *don't* have a 
</I>&gt;<i>DuoDock? (ideally would like to be able to use Ethernet crossover between 
</I>&gt;<i>a sub and a desktop system for exchanging information, if possible, 
</I>&gt;<i>otherwise would use floppies, I suppose). Like the price of the Duos more 
</I>&gt;<i>than the 2400cs, but don't want to buy into an endless headache of not 
</I>&gt;<i>being able to easily move information back and forth between sub and 
</I>&gt;<i>desktop systems, and have no desire to turn the Duo into a desktop system.
</I>
If you can get your hands on one of the mini/microdocks, then you should be 
fine. I picked up an Ethernet Microdock for $25 awhile back and it's been 
great. My only problem with the Duos is constantly wanted to spend money on 
new knicknacks :) Well, that and the keyboard. See below:


&gt;<i>If there are other freelance writers on the list using a 280c (or other 
</I>&gt;<i>Duo I should consider) or 2400c in their work, I would really love to hear 
</I>&gt;<i>about your experiences/problems with these systems, please feel free to 
</I>&gt;<i>email me off-list if preferred. This system will make an important 
</I>&gt;<i>contribution to my livelihood if I buy one, and I really need to make a 
</I>&gt;<i>sound choice.
</I>
The one big limitation of Duos is the keyboard. It sucks. Even the Type F, 
while quite usable, is far behind in usability compared even to the likes 
of a 520. That said, I love my 280c and use it for writing and typing all 
the time (though calling myself a freelance writer would be quite a 
stretch, though I do have one published article on LEM ;)   ). Once you get 
used to the keyboard it's quite usable, but I'd suggest finding someone 
locally with one to try out. Either that, or risk the $30 that you might 
end up hating it and sending it to me ;) . The other big problem would be 
batteries. I lucked out and found one that lasts 1.5-2 hours, but that's 
considering miraculous by Duo standards. If you have some electronics 
skills, it's not too hard to rebuild one for ~$40 or so, but it's still 
some work.

All in all, it's hard to beat a Duo for what you're wanting, if you can 
live with the limitations. There is full connectivity available without a 
full dock, but there are some tradeoffs.
