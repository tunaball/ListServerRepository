<PRE>Eric,

My inflated two-bits....

1. This really is a tight, thoughtful community.....and differs 
significantly from the iBook list, for whatever reason.  I'd hate to 
see the focus watered down.  It gets a bit diverse, just trying to 
filter traffic between the Duos and the 2400s as it is.

In fact, I think the members of this list have maintained the type of 
rationale, mature dialogue rarely found on public lists today.  I 
think this was really brought home when I worked through a similar 
outstanding forum thread on Rob Galbraith's Digital Photo site,
<A HREF="http://www.robgalbraith.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=16&">http://www.robgalbraith.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=16&amp;</A> 
t=000631, which is getting lots of activity due to his comparison of 
the Mac and PC platforms: 
<A HREF="http://www.robgalbraith.com/diginews/2003-01/2003_01_07_macpc.html">http://www.robgalbraith.com/diginews/2003-01/2003_01_07_macpc.html</A>

2. I think the fact that it made sense to start the iBook list 
recognizes the distinct differences the then new hardware and 
software had over the Duos/2400s.  The fact that there is a 12&quot; iBook 
of the same size as the Al/PB also makes it a bit hard to justify 
this as a pure sub-compact list.  Somehow I don't see the iBook users 
coming over just because they have a 12&quot; vs 14&quot; screen.

It may be interesting to see if the Al/PB-12 takes on a life of it's 
own(like the 2400) since it has some characteristics of the iBook and 
the PowerBook, and therefore can't really be addressed in total by 
either existing forum.

3. While discussions over whether one should migrate to the Al/PB-12&quot; 
will occur on the iBook, PB and Duo Lists, they will be on topic 
because such discussions are directly related to the hardware you are 
currently using.

4. I believe the point raised about diversification between the OSX 
and pre-OSX users is probably key to this discussion, particularly 
since neither the Duos or 99.9% of the 2400s will ever run OSX.  Some 
of the posts in the DigiNews forum thread mentioned above do a great 
job of expressing how significant a change to OSX is, with respect to 
one's 'production' environment.

Possibly it's an evolutionary thing, but I'm not so sure that a 
Al/PB-12 list might not make sense....at least once more than two 
people actually own one. ;-)

All that said, if I buy a Al/PB-12, I really would rather come here 
than anywhere else to acquire the knowledge and wisdom of guys like 
Sidney Ho, Chuck Goolsbee, Marc Sira, Ivan Drucker, Bill Fox, Jake 
Luck, Peter Liethen, John Mistretta and all the other folks that have 
provided so much content for mac2400 and this list.....and of course 
Brandy who adds a bit of female Aussie flavor, when its sorely 
needed. ;-)

In any case, a public thanks to you for supporting all these lists. 
They are greatly appreciated....

Cheers...
