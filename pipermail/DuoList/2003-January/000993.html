<PRE>hi Jeff,

just some thoughts...

i used a 280c for many years -- i did a lot of writing for the
software industry and management training projects -- so, tons of
combo text and graphics.  

the keyboard was wonderfully comfortable for me -- but, it does not
last -- this didn't bother me when i first purchased the 280c cuz i
had a warranty and replaced the keyboard every year

btw, i do not have a dock or a desktop so i &quot;lived&quot; on this computer

however, i did have a PC for emailing files -- and i didn't have any
problems with transferring text and graphics (but this gradually
became a problem with people who had newer PC versions -- so u may
need to keep an older computer around and old software)

now without a warranty, the keyboard is a bit of pain and fairly
expensive to replace w/o the warranty

the hinge has also 'broke' -- but, this took about 5 yrs to happen -
and, this may have been done by a careless authorized repair person
(long story) -- i still have to fix it

frankly, i had initially bought the 280c because it was the lightest
laptop at the time -- but since i had to carry all the peripherals
because i spent a lot of time sloughing from one place to another,
the combo was quite heavy and it made me think about getting an
all-in-one -- but u may be stronger than i am and u may be able to
leave the peripherals at home or at the office

another problem is the limited memory -- i used a lot of graphics so
it was a bit of a bear -- another problem now is the software... i'd
love to know where i can find old software for my 280c

sorry, i'm not familiar with the apps which you're using -- i used
apps such as msword, adobe illustrator, pagemaker, excel, and others

btw, when i first got the 280c straight from Apple, there was about
4 things malfunctioning -- so, i'm a bit paranoid about this and
will purchase the warranty

but once everything got repaired, the only prob was the keyboard and
friends wondered why i kept paying for the extended warranty 

hope some of the above info helps -- overall, i recommend that u
pick up a newer lighter computer (pref with a warranty)

best,

lela

</I>&gt;<i> Hi: I'm new to the list, so I apologize if my questions are
</I>&gt;<i> newbie-esque. I'm intrigued by the G4 subnotebook but not wanting
</I>&gt;<i> to shell out $1800, so looking at the Duos (specifically the 280c)
</I>&gt;<i> and the 2400c for the first time, and wanted to ask the group for
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts/opinions about which system is best for my needs. I'm a
</I>&gt;<i> writer. I would use a subnotebook primarily for writing,
</I>&gt;<i> notetaking in meetings, and field research work, with probably
</I>&gt;<i> only these &quot;oldies but goodies&quot; apps on it:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> InControl 2  and/or Palm Desktop v2 (PIM)
</I>&gt;<i> WriteNow 4.0.2 (Word processing)
</I>&gt;<i> Nisus Compact or Nisus Writer 4.1.6 (WP), or a higher version if
</I>&gt;<i> the installed OS supports it
</I>&gt;<i> MORE 3.1 and/or Acta (outliners)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The sub would replace my Newton MP2100 as my on-the-go system (I
</I>&gt;<i> can type faster than I can  handwrite with the Newton, and can
</I>&gt;<i> edit longer documents more easily on a sub, I hope). I would need
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to transfer information back and forth from the sub to
</I>&gt;<i> either a Pismo 400 or an iMac 333, or, more rarely, RTF files with
</I>&gt;<i> (gulp) a Dell PC running Windows NT.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So my burning questions:
</I>&gt;<i> Is the 2400c--given the relatively high price and hard-to-find
</I>&gt;<i> availability--overkill for this kind of work? If I buy a 2400c
</I>&gt;<i> that needs work (new mo-bo, new logic board, etc.) how hard it is
</I>&gt;<i> truly to get repair work done?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are the Duos too limited for exchanging info if you *don't* have a
</I>&gt;<i> DuoDock? (ideally would like to be able to use Ethernet crossover
</I>&gt;<i> between a sub and a desktop system for exchanging information, if
</I>&gt;<i> possible, otherwise would use floppies, I suppose). Like the price
</I>&gt;<i> of the Duos more than the 2400cs, but don't want to buy into an
</I>&gt;<i> endless headache of not being able to easily move information back
</I>&gt;<i> and forth between sub and desktop systems, and have no desire to
</I>&gt;<i> turn the Duo into a desktop system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If there are other freelance writers on the list using a 280c (or
</I>&gt;<i> other Duo I should consider) or 2400c in their work, I would
</I>&gt;<i> really love to hear about your experiences/problems with these
</I>&gt;<i> systems, please feel free to email me off-list if preferred. This
</I>&gt;<i> system will make an important contribution to my livelihood if I
</I>&gt;<i> buy one, and I really need to make a sound choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for thoughts/suggestions, and again, apologies
</I>&gt;<i> if my questions are overly naive.
