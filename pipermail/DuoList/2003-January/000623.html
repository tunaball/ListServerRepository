<PRE>Here's the deal, there are going to be people selling their 2400s so 
they can get the new 12&quot; Powerbooks. Unless yo plan on getting on of 
the new books there will be several coming up for sale soon. Someone on 
this list mention two that he had. Buy a working one, and keep yours 
for parts.

PS, If anyone has a G3 2400 they are looking to moved I may be 
interested in like a month or so.

&gt;<i> Some many months ago my beloved 2400c/180/80/1.3 died on me. It just 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't power on, not with the appropriate button, nor with the reset 
</I>&gt;<i> button. I rushed it down to TechServe (in NYC) and they told me they 
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't diagnose the problem except by replacing each part one by 
</I>&gt;<i> one, and they didn't have any parts anyway. They suggested I send it 
</I>&gt;<i> in to Apple for refurbishing. I called Apple, and they said they don't 
</I>&gt;<i> work on the 2400 anymore. So ... I looked at it, again and again, and 
</I>&gt;<i> then decided to try what often works when anything goes awry ... kick 
</I>&gt;<i> the damned thing! Well, in this case kicking wasn't the right thing to 
</I>&gt;<i> do, so I slapped my powerbook smartly on its bottom .... and lo and 
</I>&gt;<i> behold .... it started, using the reset button. Once on, it stayed on, 
</I>&gt;<i> and it worked as perfectly as always. When I shut it down, it again 
</I>&gt;<i> did not want to startup. Sometimes the slap worked and sometimes it 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't. It worked enough for me to get all my data on zip disks, which 
</I>&gt;<i> is a good thing! But not having my trusty 2400 is not a good thing. At 
</I>&gt;<i> one point I figured out that if a slap would fix it, then there must 
</I>&gt;<i> be something loose inside ... so I opened it up. I didn't go too deep 
</I>&gt;<i> inside. I just wanted to find something obviously unhinged, or maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> burned out. I found nothing obviously wrong. I did find a loose small 
</I>&gt;<i> screw (perhaps left by the person who replaced the trackpad many years 
</I>&gt;<i> ago), but it was of no consequence. I finally had to put my 2400 aside 
</I>&gt;<i> and buy a new G4 iMac. My powerbook sat for a few months in the 
</I>&gt;<i> closet, and then I just had to try it again. It is not easy to give up 
</I>&gt;<i> on these wonderful machines! Before the 2400 I had a Duo230, and it 
</I>&gt;<i> stills works like a dream (I gave it to a friend in Poland, who uses 
</I>&gt;<i> it every day.)I plugged it in, and lo and behold it seems to have 
</I>&gt;<i> developed the GLOD disease. In my case the green light stays lit only 
</I>&gt;<i> in one position of the reset button. In other words, press reset one 
</I>&gt;<i> and it's off, press it again and it's on. Also pressing the reset 
</I>&gt;<i> button produces a faint click at every other press. I don't know if 
</I>&gt;<i> these symptoms mean anything at all. I tried Sydney's power reset 
</I>&gt;<i> methods, and nothing good happened. Slapping has stopped working as 
</I>&gt;<i> well. It is just dead. Does anyone have any ideas about what might be 
</I>&gt;<i> wrong, and what I might do about it? I would open it up myself if I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought there was something I could accomplish. I would take it or 
</I>&gt;<i> send it to someone to fix if it didn't cost me an arm and a leg. Or 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps this powerbook is ready to be parted out? Everything about it 
</I>&gt;<i> was in perfect shape, and I've got a zip drive, external floppy, 
</I>&gt;<i> Global Village modem, and external CD drive as well.Ideas??
