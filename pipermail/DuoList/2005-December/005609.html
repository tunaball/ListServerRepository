<PRE>Greetings. Got my 1GB CompactFlash card and adapter. After a false  
start, I remembered not to copy the system folder from the current  
startup disk, so I booted from the OS 8.5 CD in the external drive,  
and then copied the System Folder and Apps from the hard drive. Only  
other set-up glitch was that the wireless card wouldn't work until I  
moved it to the lower slot (and moved the CF card to the upper slot).  
CF card is set as Startup disk and System Folder shows the happy Mac  
face (so appears to be properly &quot;blessed&quot;).

Everything appears to working with the CF card as the boot drive  
EXCEPT for the fact that whenever I open folders with the &quot;triangle  
opener&quot;, launch applications or click on links in my web browser the  
hard drive spins-up! I suspect this is NOT supposed to be happening  
as it defeats the whole purpose of silently running and battery  
saving from the CF card. What am I missing?

Also, I noticed that when I had the hard drive set as the Startup  
disk and the CF card was inserted as a second disk there wasn't a  
clear way for me to Eject the CF card since Cmd-E wouldn't work and  
Eject was grayed-out in the Special Menu. I had to use a paper clip  
to manually eject the disk during a restart since I couldn't unmount  
the drive while in use. Is there a problem here? (Incidentally, I  
initially initialized the CF card with OS Extended format from Erase  
Disk... Is this OK?)

Thanks for your assistance!
