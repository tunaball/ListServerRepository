<PRE>It GLODs intermittently and I cannot make it work consistently.  I've  
had it apart about 3 times, trying various things, and unless it is  
the RAM, I assume it is either the board or processor.

When the machine has power, the power button on the keyboard has no  
effect.  However, you can press the hard-power button on the back  
panel and the green light will come on and stay solid.  If you press  
the hard power button again, the speaker will pop and the light will  
go out.  I was thinking maybe it was the AC power connection, but the  
same effect was had with a charged battery.

It's been like this for about a year and I've only successfully  
gotten it to boot about 4 times.  If you let it sit with no power for  
about 3 months, you can usually get it to boot after about 10 minutes  
of fooling with the right combination of taking the battery out,  
plugging it in, putting the battery in, praying to the right god, and  
orientating it with certain heavenly bodies.  The last time I booted  
it was about 2 weeks ago when I put a new PRAM battery in it.  It  
started up with some process that I'll call &quot;luck&quot;, I used it for  
about an hour, shut it down, and haven't been able to reboot it  
since.  Some time ago I tried running it with no PRAM battery plugged  
in, and it seemed to work okay, but it froze on waking from sleep,  
and I was only able to reboot once after that, whereupon it froze  
during the boot process.

It kind of acts like a terminally fubared power manager, which I  
suppose it could be.  I believe there is something fairly seriously  
wrong, however, as I heard a capacitor (at least I assume that's what  
it was) squealing like mad when I was last trying to get the little  
bugger running.  I've tried it with three different power supplies,  
there was no difference in behavior with any of them.  I've gone so  
far as to strip it down to the chassis, unseat and reseat the  
processor, and do the same with the memory and all of the internal  
cable connections.  No effect.

So, my decision is, rather than keep screwing with it, I'm going to  
just take advantage of the (really great) deal I was offered on the  
list and do a 'replacement'.  I've not really owned a PowerBook that  
I like as much as the 2400, so never mind moving on.  Actually, my  
first laptop was a Duo 230, then a gigantic PowerBook 540c, then a  
Duo 2300c which I really really liked, and when I finally did that  
one in (actually, I just left it someplace where a glass of water  
could be easily spilled in to it... then a glass of water was spilled  
in to it), I moved on to my 2400c which I absolutely love.  My job  
let's me make use of a dual-USB iBook, which I traded to from the 500  
MHz Pismo I was using, but none of them are quite as comfortable as  
the 2400.

So enough of my life story... thanks for all of the response, folks!
