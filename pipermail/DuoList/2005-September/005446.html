<PRE>&gt;<i>It GLODs intermittently and I cannot make it work consistently. 
</I>&gt;<i>I've had it apart about 3 times, trying various things, and unless 
</I>&gt;<i>it is the RAM, I assume it is either the board or processor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>When the machine has power, the power button on the keyboard has no 
</I>&gt;<i>effect.  However, you can press the hard-power button on the back 
</I>&gt;<i>panel and the green light will come on and stay solid.  If you press 
</I>&gt;<i>the hard power button again, the speaker will pop and the light will 
</I>&gt;<i>go out.  I was thinking maybe it was the AC power connection, but 
</I>&gt;<i>the same effect was had with a charged battery.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It's been like this for about a year and I've only successfully 
</I>&gt;<i>gotten it to boot about 4 times.  If you let it sit with no power 
</I>&gt;<i>for about 3 months, you can usually get it to boot after about 10 
</I>&gt;<i>minutes of fooling with the right combination of taking the battery 
</I>&gt;<i>out, plugging it in, putting the battery in, praying to the right 
</I>&gt;<i>god, and orientating it with certain heavenly bodies.  The last time 
</I>&gt;<i>I booted it was about 2 weeks ago when I put a new PRAM battery in 
</I>&gt;<i>it.  It started up with some process that I'll call &quot;luck&quot;, I used 
</I>&gt;<i>it for about an hour, shut it down, and haven't been able to reboot 
</I>&gt;<i>it since.  Some time ago I tried running it with no PRAM battery 
</I>&gt;<i>plugged in, and it seemed to work okay, but it froze on waking from 
</I>&gt;<i>sleep, and I was only able to reboot once after that, whereupon it 
</I>&gt;<i>froze during the boot process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It kind of acts like a terminally fubared power manager, which I 
</I>&gt;<i>suppose it could be.  I believe there is something fairly seriously 
</I>&gt;<i>wrong, however, as I heard a capacitor (at least I assume that's 
</I>&gt;<i>what it was) squealing like mad when I was last trying to get the 
</I>&gt;<i>little bugger running.  I've tried it with three different power 
</I>&gt;<i>supplies, there was no difference in behavior with any of them. 
</I>&gt;<i>I've gone so far as to strip it down to the chassis, unseat and 
</I>&gt;<i>reseat the processor, and do the same with the memory and all of the 
</I>&gt;<i>internal cable connections.  No effect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So, my decision is, rather than keep screwing with it, I'm going to 
</I>&gt;<i>just take advantage of the (really great) deal I was offered on the 
</I>&gt;<i>list and do a 'replacement'.  I've not really owned a PowerBook that 
</I>&gt;<i>I like as much as the 2400, so never mind moving on.  Actually, my 
</I>&gt;<i>first laptop was a Duo 230, then a gigantic PowerBook 540c, then a 
</I>&gt;<i>Duo 2300c which I really really liked, and when I finally did that 
</I>&gt;<i>one in (actually, I just left it someplace where a glass of water 
</I>&gt;<i>could be easily spilled in to it... then a glass of water was 
</I>&gt;<i>spilled in to it), I moved on to my 2400c which I absolutely love. 
</I>&gt;<i>My job let's me make use of a dual-USB iBook, which I traded to from 
</I>&gt;<i>the 500 MHz Pismo I was using, but none of them are quite as 
</I>&gt;<i>comfortable as the 2400.
</I>
Hmmm..did you check the fuses on the I/O and motherboards ?

Swapping the CPU might fix the problem.
