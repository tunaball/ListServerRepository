&gt;<i> Hi.

</I>&gt;<i> it appears that I don't have the proper power adapter. In the bag there 
</I>&gt;<i> was also a dock for the Duos, which appears to be a simple port 
</I>&gt;<i> replicator. I attached it to the 280c, and now it's stuck on. (Oops!) 
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't seem to be a problem though.
</I>
There are different versions of Mini-Docks.  I have two, one has a SCSI 
port and one has a 10Base-T port.  The SCSI dock needs a PowerBook style 
cable to connect it to most SCSI perphierals.

The PB145 takes an altogether different power adapter, it provides 7V @ 
2A with a coax power connector.

The Duo 210, 230, 270, 270c, 280, 280c all have much in common.  I know 
the batteries, displays and certain other parts can be swapped around. 
There are some differences in the batteries though.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The bag also included an external 3.5&quot; drive, which attaches to the dock.
</I>
A Floppy drive?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As of now, I'm focusing on the 280c, since it seems to have the most 
</I>&gt;<i> potential. According to &quot;About this computer&quot; in the Apple menu (Why 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't it say &quot;About this Mac&quot;?) it has 40,960 KB of memory, which LEM 
</I>&gt;<i> says is the max for this model.
</I>
It may be reporting virtual memory or real memory, I don't recall the 
what the specific messages say.  Look in the Apple Menu for &quot;Apple 
System Profiler&quot; it will give you more info.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In reading the articles about it last night, it appears that it can be 
</I>&gt;<i> upgraded to a PowerPC processor by swapping in a Duo 2300c logic board. 
</I>&gt;<i> For a system that I bought solely to tinker with, is that feasible? If 
</I>&gt;<i> so, how do I obtain a donor logic board and where are the instructions 
</I>&gt;<i> to accomplish the upgrade?
</I>
I would first look around for a 2300c, 5300c or such.  I don't see much 
point in trying to boost the CPU performance of older models as it's 
likely you can get a newer (but still old) model for as much as the upgrade.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These aremy very first Macs, so wish me luck!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Have fun.

The Duos are a nice, very compact laptop.  A web browser on one is going 
to be rather limited on the Internet today (as is a browser on any Mac 
running OS 9 or earlier).  But it can still connect to many sites.  But 
can certainly handle e-mail and writing asa well as other tasks.
