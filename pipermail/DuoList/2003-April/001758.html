<PRE>Hello-

I'm new to the list--have been lurking these past few days. I joined 
because I have a problem with a Duo 2300, but I suppose it's fair to 
introduce myself before I ask my question. :-)

I joined the Duo-using ranks in a rather vicarious way, back in 1997, 
when I bought my wife a 280c. She loved that little guy, and we still 
have it. After seeing her enjoy her 280, I eventually broke down and 
bought myself a 230. I used it as a secondary computer for word 
processing, but fell in love with the portable concept, upgrading to a 
1400 and eventually use a Pismo. I also adopted a 2300c from a friend 
when he no longer needed it. I have a full complement of 
accessories--SCSI dock by Newer, Floppy dock, mini-dock and a Duo Dock 
I (and don't let anybody tell you that the color models don't fit in 
it--they do.) :-)

Anyway, between the three Duos, I have two working keyboards, but since 
the 280 has a broken plug for the power supply, it only works within 
the dock, and is currently in retirement/backup status, it has a dead 
keyboard. The 230 is on loan to an elderly friend who uses it for 
playing and writing letters. I just gave my parents my 2300.


It was when I gave my 2300 to my parents that I ran into trouble. I 
tried to set it up for them to use the internal modem, but I couldn't 
get it recognized. I suppose I should say that this Duo is running from 
the hard drive from a newer computer, which happens to have OS 9.0.4 on 
it. I realized that I would need the software, but a quick browsing 
through Apple's site gave me the willies. Is it true that the 2300 uses 
a software modem? What was it called--the PowerPort modem? Or does it 
use the older Global Village modem? What software do I need to get this 
internal modem to work? I sent the computer home with them, set up to 
use their external 56k modem, but I would still like to get the 
internal modem working if it's possible, even if it's not worth it.

What kind of advice can you give me? What software does it need? Is it 
worth it?
