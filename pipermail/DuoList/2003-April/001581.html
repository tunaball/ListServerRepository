<PRE>Bon, my thoughts FWIW:

DT&amp;T	$150
Shipping both ways:	$40+
$200 minimum for repair.
The DT&amp;T is just replacing your I/O board with one they previously 
repaired..which is fine, just don't think you are getting a 'new' one.

If you like your 2400, the $200 is probably worth it.  I wouldn't add 
a G3($300-500) on top of the repair cost, not with iBooks under 
$1000. Thought you could drop a 20GB drive in there at the same time 
for the cost of the HD, maybe $100 max...but only if you really need 
the room.

Conversely you could shop for a 2400 similar to yours. Used 2400s are 
selling for what, $250-300 or less?, maybe without the RAM or most 
likely without the bigger HD....but you could then part yours out or 
sell it DOA for $100. Net cost reduced..and yes it may GLOD also, 
then you just do it again...as 2400s drop in price. The options vary 
a bit if you know how to swap memory or HD yourself and it's just the 
logic board repair you're stuck on.

This gets to be a harder question as the 2400 really begins to show 
its age, but then again it's a killer machine for what it will do for 
$300 or so. ;-)

To really complicate your choices there's a 2400/G3 on eBay with a 
$500 Buy it Now price. I'm not a big fan of the Newer G3, but this 
seems like a nice bundle for the price. (Caveat, I have no personal 
knowledge of the machine)

y=14908

Heck I've got three 2400s, two of which I probably ought to sell, 
just can't get my Garage Sale list built for the mac2400 For Sale 
page.

Well, I did say FWIW.... :-)

Good luck...


&gt;<i>oh dear, my 2400c finally got the GLOD
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is a stock 2400 in very nice shape with 80 mb ram and a 10gb 
</I>&gt;<i>toshiba drive (from ti-book).
</I>&gt;<i>i don't have a g3 in it. but i do have a 2nd battery and a nice 
</I>&gt;<i>wireless card and a dockking staiton for it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>DTT , Brian, says he is 99% sure it is the I/O board. I assume this 
</I>&gt;<i>is the same power I/O board others have had replaced. He says $150 
</I>&gt;<i>and i should be up and running.
</I>&gt;<i>If i had a G3 upgrade to install now would certainly be the time to add one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyone got any G3 upgrades , or any other fixes i can attempt?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It seems to me that if i were to get another of these $300 2400's 
</I>&gt;<i>from ebay or this list that i would be getting the same old powerI/O 
</I>&gt;<i>board and not a new one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>ANy thoughts on the viability of this old 2400?
</I>&gt;<i>thanks...
</I>&gt;<i>Bon
