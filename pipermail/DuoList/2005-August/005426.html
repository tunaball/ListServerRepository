<PRE>Hi Greg,

&gt;<i> Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hard to part with, but here goes (!snif!):
</I>
Hang in there, guy...&lt;sympathetically&gt; I know it hurts to say good 
bye...&lt;eyeing Comet and accessories enviously&gt; but I'm sure you'll find 
a good home for your old friend...&lt;cross-fade to Peter Lorre&gt; Well well 
well, look at what I just found...room for one more PowerBook in my 
loving family.  Imagine that...!

&gt;<i> Apple PowerBook 2400c, cardbussed
</I>&gt;<i> G3 240MHz, 512k cache
</I>&gt;<i> 112MB RAM
</I>&gt;<i> 40 GIG hard drive
</I>&gt;<i> AC adapter
</I>
...and a battery, perhaps?

&gt;<i> The extras:
</I>&gt;<i> External floppy drive
</I>&gt;<i> External Sony PRD-650 &quot;discman&quot; CD-ROM drive, bootable
</I>&gt;<i> 180MHz processor card (original)
</I>&gt;<i> 64MB RAM chip
</I>&gt;<i> 2400c motherboard
</I>&gt;<i> Wireless PCMCIA card, uses OS9 Airport software
</I>&gt;<i> 10/100 ethernet PCMCIA card
</I>&gt;<i> 56k PCMCIA modem
</I>&gt;<i> Capsure PCMCIA video in with Critter Cam
</I>&gt;<i> NewerTech Bookendz
</I>&gt;<i> ADB flexlight (tres cool)
</I>&gt;<i> ADB infrared remote for presentation (forward/back)
</I>
Quite a package, and very close to exactly how I'd like to see my Comet 
configged in the near future.  I picked mine up via ebay and it has 
only one flaw, but it's one that sticks in my craw: there's a small gap 
between the casing pieces on one side.  Though most folks would 
consider this a minor cosmetic flaw, I'm extremely bummed because I 
want to do a major paint job mod and need all the joins to be clean and 
tight.  I'm preparing an ebay listing today to sell it for this reason, 
and am actively seeking a structurally and cosmetically intact 
replacement.  I won't have the cash needed for this replacement for 
perhaps another week or ten days, but maybe we can talk turkey...?

&gt;<i> Extra extras:
</I>&gt;<i> Apple Laserwriter 4/600
</I>&gt;<i> Extra screen plastics for 2400c, in case you want to paint it!
</I>
No need for a LaserWriter (and certainly wouldn't want to pay for 
shipping it!), but any extra plastics that will make my paint mod 
project easier would be welcome.

&gt;<i> It has also had a lot of thermal modifications, which has brought the 
</I>&gt;<i> CPU
</I>&gt;<i> temp down about 10 degrees from normal.
</I>
Glad to hear it.  My current Comet also has a NewerTech 240, and I've 
yet to find the supplies needed to upgrade the heatsink.  I assume 
that's 10 degrees Fahrenheit rather Celsius...?

&gt;<i> The trackpad click button is sticky (normal on this model), and can be 
</I>&gt;<i> fixed by replacing the switch--a modification described on the 'net (I 
</I>&gt;<i> mostly just tap on the pad).
</I>
Same here - pretty much a non-issue.

&gt;<i> ONE ISSUE! There is one issue that I have not solved to date: ever 
</I>&gt;<i> since I
</I>&gt;<i> installed the G3 upgrade, the 'Book will not wake from sleep properly. 
</I>&gt;<i> Thus
</I>&gt;<i> I set the hard drive to spin down, and the monitor to dim, but the 
</I>&gt;<i> PowerBook
</I>&gt;<i> does not &quot;sleep&quot; as such.
</I>
Oh well, nobody's perfect...;^)

&gt;<i> I have my price in mind, but reply off-list and let me know what you 
</I>&gt;<i> think.
</I>
I'm talking to Ralph about buying his last &quot;extra&quot; Comet.  It's a nice, 
complete package for $175 shipped...but there aren't as many extras and 
accessories as you're offering.  Of course, I don't really want/need 
everything listed so....

How much can I get for $200 including shipping?
The items of least importance to me, listed in order of disposability:
Capsure PCMCIA video in with Critter Cam;
ADB infrared remote for presentation (forward/back);
64MB RAM chip;
ADB flexlight (tres cool);
2400c motherboard;
56k PCMCIA modem.

I'd think you could get enough on ebay or the Swaplist for those items 
to make it worth your while to list them....
Do we have a basis for further discussion here?

&gt;<i> (I'm still holding on to my 280c and minidock!)
</I>
Ah, a true kindred spirit.  I'm also keeping my 280c close at hand, 
albeit with a fully tricked out Dock rather than minidock.  &quot;Frank&quot; is 
one of Mad Dog's FrankenDuo specials with ADB port, lighted trackball, 
and CPU o/c'ed to 37.5 MHz.

Pax,
