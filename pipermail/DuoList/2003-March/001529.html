<PRE>Previously:

&gt;<i> &gt;I still haven't decided whether to get a Duo or not. On the one hand I 
</I>&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;them because they're just so funky, can take 40Mb RAM (540c does 36Mb) 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;are small enough to cart just about anywhere, but on the other hand, they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;sound like they can be a real PITA to live with.
</I>
&gt;<i> Eh, I use and love my 280c quite a lot. THough I also lucked out and got 
</I>&gt;<i> a 
</I>&gt;<i> battery that lasts 1.5-2 hours, which helps. With a type-F keyboard, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> tolerable if not ideal. It's not terrible carting around one of the small 
</I>&gt;<i> ADB keyboards and a floppy adapter. One of these days I plan on doing the 
</I>&gt;<i> ADB port mod, since I never use the modem anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you get used to the limitations and understand them fully, it's a very 
</I>&gt;<i> nice little machine. 
</I>
I take mine (a 280c) from the office to home and back all the time. I often 
write in bed. It's easy with a Duo. At work, I simply put it in the Dock, 
and switch between my main computer and the docked Duo.

It's small and does what I want.

Someday when I get (or jerry-rig) a working battery, it'll be GREAT! But 
it's often possible to plug in my Duo on the road. For instance, when I 
train up to Seattle, I often plug it in and get some work there. And even 
the train station in where I catch it has wall sockets for power. (Amtrak 
is often late.)

So, it's fine as a secondary machine. I've not bothered to hook it up for 
the Internet, though it would do that (if slowly) too.

It helps not having high demands on processing power. I guess I'd like a 
2300c so I could use my copy of Finale (a program that requires PPC). But 
Word, Excel and SimpleText are my mainstays for what I do. So the 280c is 
fine for me. 

By the way, my 280c came with LotusNotes installed. But I apparently 
destroyed all the help files for it. Does anyone know anything about 
LotusNotes for Mac? I couldn't find it for sale now, much less get some 
information on how to use it.
