I was pushing for touch screen Imac's using a Mac POS, but they fought me at 
every turn.... poor saps are afraid of Mac's..  I do have them talked into a 
new more reliable POS using Windows interface and touch screen registers, 
have to get them away from DOS (Was designed to run on 486 pc's up to Win NT 
4),  Since Win 2000 and Win XP Pro use Virtual DOS not real DOS older 
Real/DOS programs run ito alot of problems.
What OS on the 230's? How much Ram? (ICAB...  ICAB .. small fast alot better 
for the 230 than Netscape or Explorer!)

If you can find a good 2400  they are pretty darn good,   Small, Light, PC 
Slot's can be cardbus enabled (32bit)  the 2400 is upgradable to a G3 (can't 
do that with a 2300)
Down fall of the 2400 is upgrades cost out the butt and they are getting 
aged parts are gonna be getting harder to find.  They also have a tiny 
litttle GLOD problem in case you haven't been reading the List.  The 2400 
will run 8.1 and up to 9, am not sure about X .... maybe but not well given 
the ram limits on the 2400.
The 2300 shares the Dock II with the 280 Pretty much the same computer as 
the 280 Problem with the 2300 are No PC slots and you need a mini dock, 
external CD, external floppy,  when traveling....  Other wise it's a great 
little book, lets you run PPC programs that the 280 will not run it will 
also take a higher OS that the 280 (280 will take 8.1 and the 2300 will run 
8.6).  If you want really good advice...
2400 makes a nice toy (Sorry folks) great for playing around and 
experementing with....
Of the 2 since you have Docks already your pretty much set up for the 2300. 
(Cost is alot lower)
Look around a bit there is still the 1400, 3400, Lombard, Pismo, Wallstreet, 
Bronze and the prices are comming down on those models fast since the Ibook 
came out

Hello Brandy:

I now have two Duo 230's, one with an internal Express modem.  Can
anyone here (Please) tell me what all I need to have to activate and use
the modem for internet work and which version of iCAB, Netscape Nav, or
IE works best in your experience.  I also have two DuoDocks, one with an
FPU.  Can anyone here (Please) tell me where to find a picture of a
DuoDock II or describe the differences between a Dock and a Dock II, so
that I can recognize one when I find it at the local thrift store when I
raise the cover.  Yes, I do know about the difference in covers,
however, the Docks I have seen so far have the upgrade cover and I was
fooled by that into thinking that they were IIs.

Second.  Could I please get opinion's on the advantages and
disadvantages of the 2300 vs. the 2400.  I'm interested in purchasing
one or the other, but would like to know actual user experience before I
decide to spend $100 or more on one of these.  I'd like to know all the
bells and whistles, too, if the memories of your past experiences aren't
too painful.  I intend to use the machine for personal writing during
long hikes or bicycle journeys, so power issues (adapter and battery
ease of use and reliability) and costs are _very_ important.

Sincerely yours, Grizzlygiant
