Sorry for being vague.

The ribbon cable does indeed separate fine, and can be gotten separately, 
it's just very very rare to find someone who is just selling the ribbon. 
Either they've broken it themselves at some point and are just selling the 
trackpad, or they're selling them as a unit. If you get lucky and find one, 
great, but it might take some luck and/or patience :)

The trackballs would probably be all three. They were in all the Duo 
210-280s, while only the 2300's had pads, so they're more readily 
available. They attach to the main case bottom totally instead of having a 
ribbon running from the bottom to the top, so you're not as likely to 
damage them. Also many people prefer them to the pads, so you could say 
they're easier to use. Due to the general availability, they tend to be 
cheaper too.

Head over to www.lowendmac.com and you'll find the swaplist listed there. 
You'll find all manner of Macintosh (and more!) stuff for sale over there. 
Should be very easy to find what you need. If you're going to go trackball, 
all you'll need is the trackball itself and a 210-280-style case top (The 
bit that surrounds the keyboard and includes the trackpad on the 2300c; 
it's just a hole for the trackball on the 210-280 style). Should swap right 
in without any trouble. Don't even need to run any Add New Hardware wizards ;)


&gt;<i>Thanks again for everyones help and interest.  I think it is great to be 
</I>&gt;<i>able to learn about this computer.  So far every step I take is a positive 
</I>&gt;<i>one even if it seems like one backward at the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
