Exxcuuuuuuuuuuuuse me? Most of the disappointing tone and content you've 
been reading was written by said Lister, not by respondents. Even with 
less-than-nice replies from said Lister to every post what didn't _hand_ 
him the exact item for which he searched, another respondent correctly 
pointed out said Lister continued to get what were intended to be helpful 
pointers.

However, I have to say I'm somewhat reluctant to try to help those who 
don't appreciate the time and thought spent trying to help them solve 
their problem. Even a short intending-to-be-helpful-response takes 
someone's attention. If that reply isn't helpful, it would seem easier to 
ignore it and move on than post a response pointing out how unhelpful was 
that person's time and thought and attention. There's surely something to 
the old maxim that if you've got nothing nice to say, say nothing.

And Mr. Corcoran since you bring up the subject of being helpful . . . 
while we were all thrilled with your generous offer (posted to the list 
of course) to send floppies of the needed SW, consider your offer doesn't 
really help anyone else unless of course you are offering to mail 
floppy-copies to anyone/everyone who asks. I'm sure said Lister isn't the 
only user who may need that SW. Posting a public source for the SW helps 
_anyone_ to get it, now and in the future. Yeah, I forgot to mention the 
'update-needs-tomeviewer-thing', but I did correct in a subsequent post 
which anyone searching the archives would hopefully find.

just my $78.39,

Dan K

PS: one of my own many failings -&gt; I tire easily of the humorless 
ungrateful. (Ooops, that's probably not be a super-nice thing to say, but 
who the shoes fit probably won't recognize their own feet anyway. :-)
