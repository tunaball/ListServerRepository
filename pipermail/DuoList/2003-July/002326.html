Hello Brandy:

My mother was head of bookkeeping for a small restaurant chain which
bought a new POS system back in 1995.  The POS shop's representative
spent 3 days (for a large fee) confusing the waiters, staff, and my
mother on how it all worked.  Three weeks later, mom had to go to the
provider's shop in Florida to get them to tell her how it _actually_
worked.  The last I heard, it had crashed once or twice a week pretty
regularly unless it was fed acorns (hee, Squirrel) every Saturday night
during the dinner rush.  (I don't actually know whether it was Squirrel
or not)

Now, for something on topic.  Well, let's see


I now have two Duo 230's, one with an internal Express modem.  Can
anyone here (Please) tell me what all I need to have to activate and use
the modem for internet work and which version of iCAB, Netscape Nav, or
IE works best in your experience.  I also have two DuoDocks, one with an
FPU.  Can anyone here (Please) tell me where to find a picture of a
DuoDock II or describe the differences between a Dock and a Dock II, so
that I can recognize one when I find it at the local thrift store when I
raise the cover.  Yes, I do know about the difference in covers,
however, the Docks I have seen so far have the upgrade cover and I was
fooled by that into thinking that they were IIs.

Second.  Could I please get opinion's on the advantages and
disadvantages of the 2300 vs. the 2400.  I'm interested in purchasing
one or the other, but would like to know actual user experience before I
decide to spend $100 or more on one of these.  I'd like to know all the
bells and whistles, too, if the memories of your past experiences aren't
too painful.  I intend to use the machine for personal writing during
long hikes or bicycle journeys, so power issues (adapter and battery
ease of use and reliability) and costs are _very_ important.

Lastly, a little help, I hope.  I have been buying old Duo (230)
batteries and so far have two really good ones out of five purchased at
$5 each.  I recovered them by simply charging them on a standard Radio
Sack (hee haw) charger until it reached about 7V and then charged up to
useful voltage in the Duo.  I then drain the batteries using
DeepDischarge (not Bat. Amnesia) and then finish the discharge by
shorting for a few minutes.  I just ran the 230 from Saturday morning
until last night (Tuesday) on sleep with about 2-3 hours working usage,
the last with file sharing enabled.  Many here certainly already know
this, but, you can open the battery case and replace the NiMH battery
cells with standard ones from any electronics store.  You just have to
get tabs welded (yes, welded) on the new batteries.  I working on the
feasibility of using Lithium rechargeables in place of the NiMH, but I
probably won't have anything to report for a year or so.

I have also found that Duo SCSI harddrives will work in PB 500s.

Sorry for the length, I've been lurking for a while and thinking about
Duos for a couple of years.

Sincerely yours, Grizzlygiant

</PRE>
