<PRE>Excellent review, and as far as the weight is concerned if you were to 
remove the internal battery then the actual weight of powerbook + 
external is a lot closer to the weight of the Powerbook and internal 
battery.

</I>&gt;<i> I know that a few others had indicated they would post their results

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For those of you who aren&#8217;t familiar, the Electrovaya batteries are 
</I>&gt;<i> lithium ion
</I>&gt;<i> power sources for notebook computers.  There are three models, the 80, 
</I>&gt;<i> 120, and the
</I>&gt;<i> 160.  The number represents the power capacity in watt-hours.  Weight 
</I>&gt;<i> ranges from
</I>&gt;<i> 1.4 lbs (for the 80) to 2.4 lbs (for the 160).  Size of the PowerPad 
</I>&gt;<i> 160 is just a
</I>&gt;<i> little bigger than the footprint for the 2400c and about 3/8&#8221; thick.  
</I>&gt;<i> The size and
</I>&gt;<i> thickness of these batteries mean that they pretty easily fit into 
</I>&gt;<i> backpack or
</I>&gt;<i> briefcase-type computer carriers.  These buggers are expensive&#8212;around 
</I>&gt;<i> $400 for the
</I>&gt;<i> PowerPad 160 at Provantage&#8212;but they can be used for any G3 or G4 
</I>&gt;<i> PowerBook, not just
</I>&gt;<i> the 2400c.  I bought this thing for work, to use in remote field 
</I>&gt;<i> research situations
</I>&gt;<i> where access to AC power is not very consistent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a problem with the first one I received.  At first I thought 
</I>&gt;<i> that the thing
</I>&gt;<i> was for some reason incompatible with the 2400c because no power was 
</I>&gt;<i> supplied and my
</I>&gt;<i> internal PowerBook battery ran down as it normally does when I&#8217;m not 
</I>&gt;<i> using an AC
</I>&gt;<i> adapter:  maybe 1.5 hrs worth of charge.  However, I had an 
</I>&gt;<i> electronics tech where I
</I>&gt;<i> work test the power output, and surprise&#8230;almost zero.  The PowerPad 
</I>&gt;<i> comes with two
</I>&gt;<i> output cables (to fit G3 and G4 PowerBooks), and both showed no 
</I>&gt;<i> output.  So I
</I>&gt;<i> contacted Electrovaya.  To make a long story short, it took a long 
</I>&gt;<i> time and many
</I>&gt;<i> calls/emails to get an RMA to return the battery and get a 
</I>&gt;<i> replacement, but I
</I>&gt;<i> finally did and it arrived yesterday.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I charged it up and this morning thought I would see what kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> duration I
</I>&gt;<i> would get out of the thing.  The result:  it has powered my 2400c for 
</I>&gt;<i> 9 hrs straight
</I>&gt;<i> and the built in LED &#8220;fuel gauge&#8221; indicates that the PowerPad is still 
</I>&gt;<i> at 10-20%
</I>&gt;<i> capacity.  That&#8217;s not the lowest power level the gauge will show, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t want
</I>&gt;<i> to sit around waiting for the battery to drain (it&#8217;s actually hot and 
</I>&gt;<i> sunny in
</I>&gt;<i> Seattle).  So...I would figure a nominal 10 hrs of use from the 
</I>&gt;<i> PowerPad before the
</I>&gt;<i> internal PowerBook battery has to kick in, which would give another 
</I>&gt;<i> hour or so of
</I>&gt;<i> use.  That&#8217;s a pretty decent long day&#8217;s work and might even last 
</I>&gt;<i> through an ugly set
</I>&gt;<i> of flights complete with airport delays.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The two main disadvantages are the initial cost (about the same as a 
</I>&gt;<i> 2400c on eBay),
</I>&gt;<i> and the fact that the battery has to be recharged via its own AC 
</I>&gt;<i> adapter (included)
</I>&gt;<i> (some notebook chargers provide the proper input voltage for the 
</I>&gt;<i> battery and an
</I>&gt;<i> additional charger is not needed&#8212;that&#8217;s not the case for PowerBooks).  
</I>&gt;<i> Now that I
</I>&gt;<i> have a unit that works&#8212;I have to say the performance of the PowerPad 
</I>&gt;<i> 160 is
</I>&gt;<i> outstanding.  The fact that it works with the whole family of G3 and 
</I>&gt;<i> G4 PowerBooks
</I>&gt;<i> makes it a pretty versatile external source of power if a couple of 
</I>&gt;<i> pounds of
</I>&gt;<i> additional weight (and the cost) aren&#8217;t a deal-breaker for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers, Gary
