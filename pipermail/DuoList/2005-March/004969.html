--Duo 280 and 2400c&quot;

	Yes it does have life.  I was looking at the archives and was
very happy to find that there was life here.  If nothing else the
archives were and are an interesting read.

	So I have a 280c with a good working battery and in good
condition.  I picked it up from the First Saturday Sidewalk Sale, fixed
it up, was playing with it, and just when I was getting into it, a
fellow worker saw it, fell in love with it, and asked if I had more
since she needed something like that for college.  I said no, but I
would sell her my Duo.  And I did.  Missed the 280c, but knew it was
going to a good place.

	A year later, she got a newer laptop, thanked me again, and I
bought the Duo back from her.

	So I get to play with this Duo some more.  

	It is really small.  I like the size.  I like how it can be
docked, and I like how the dock has appletalk for networking.  I can
take it home, throw it in a dock, load it with apps, and then eject it.

      I think at this point I am wondering where I can find good 68K
programs for this 280c.  Got a few ideas for this 280, but the ideas
are...

-A Spreadsheet
-More memory (20 mb to 40 mb or whatever the max is)
-Bigger hard drive.. where can I find one?
-Might actually lower the operating system for more compatibility.  Not
sure.

	I also have a non-functional 2300.  It has the situation where
if you plug it into the dock the dock just chimes and chimes away.
Blown bios?

	I know the 280 is not talked about much here, but hey it is the
Duo I have so what suggestions for upgrades and good programs (and
suggestable programs) would everyone here have for it?

	Oh yeh... where can I get a Macintosh version of a monitor and
keyboard switchbox?  (So I can switch between my bigger mac and the Duo)
Just curious on this one.

	Thanks!
