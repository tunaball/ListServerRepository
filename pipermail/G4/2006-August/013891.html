<PRE>It's me again.  I called Sonnet Tech Support--fortunately I have unlimited long-distance service--I was on hold for about 15 minutes--to 
California--but I was bound and determined to talk to a person, not just leave a message.  I explained the problem, and the  tech was quick to say the PC-100 reading of the RAM had nothing to do with the processor, that probably one of the components in the processor was overheating.  He mentioned leaving the case open and having a fan blow on it--I didn't respond to that--thhen he said he would send me an e-mail that I had to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot;--model #, serial #, name, address, date of purchase etc., and said when I submitted it he would send me an RMA # and I should return the processor, it was obviously faulty.  Which he did and I returned immediately. (Whew!)

I have purchased two other Sonnet processor upgrades, and one Newer Technologies (back in the day).  I upgraded a Power Mac 6100, 5500, and 8600, and have had ZERO problems with them.  I thought this would be another &quot;piece of cake&quot;.  I'll keep you posted on the outcome.  

Thank you one and all for the feedback.

Nate
