<PRE>I guess that's the thing...  I never used to hear about upgrade 
problems in the past because nobody I knew ever got one.  However, I 
did once end up with a PM6100/60 that was overclocked to 80MHz, and 
while it was loud, it also never gave me a problem during the year or 
so that it was my main machine.  I forget the manufacturer of the 
overclocking setup...

I also ended up with a Power Computing PTP225 running a Newer Tech 
G3/500 board that ran just swell until recently.  I'm pretty sure the 
hard drive simply died in it, but until I can be sure, I guess there is 
the possibility that there were problems with the G3 board.

Anyway, I think my point is... um... I think it's that I have long had 
an interest in upgrades, but if they're more failure-prone now, I guess 
I'll have to squelch that interest and try to scrounge up the dough for 
a faster, newer machine.  So, I am in fact very interested in how your 
situation turns out.
