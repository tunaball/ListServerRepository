<PRE>Thank you, Brett. I'm saving your note and will check back with you 
when it happens again. The only new thing was my son figured out on the 
display you could make it sleep by touching the status light on the 
lower right. So for about a day we were using that. I'm thinking that 
perhaps never worked right and we are only discovering it now, 4 years 
later LOL. I also turned off sleep since some replies suggested it's a 
malfunction with sleep. So far, a couple days later, no problems. I was 
thinking maybe backlight but when I flash a light on the dark screen 
there's nothing, and evidently backlight probs often show up as half a 
lit screen and when the screen is off and you shine a light you can see 
your desktop on the monitor.

We'll see. The system is 4-1/2 years old so I am prepared for anything. 
I love it tho!

What's your email address? When I try to reply just to you, I get an 
error due to the space between Brett and George.

</I>&gt;<i> Mouse and keyboard suddenly stopped working, so tried a number of USB 
</I>&gt;<i> ports and they working off the hub. Seems the ports on the monitor 
</I>&gt;<i> have gone bad? My understanding these things happen. The monitor is an 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple 17&quot; LCD display from 2002. However, my son is complaining the 
</I>&gt;<i> monitor is going to sleep alot, and that seems to be true, too. I 
</I>&gt;<i> turned off Hot Corners to remove that variable, but except for writing 
</I>&gt;<i> this note (it's behaving now) it was flashing on - off - on - off. I 
</I>&gt;<i> did Apple Hardware Test and all passed (I was wondering maybe video 
</I>&gt;<i> RAM going?) Tried Apple First Aid but said didn't support. I'm sure 
</I>&gt;<i> I've done this before, but maybe not with Jaguar. Next step I suppose 
</I>&gt;<i> would be to try Diskwarrior, see what it finds, but this would be 
</I>&gt;<i> checking out the OS, right? I want to check the hardware first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any way to check out the monitor itself? Guess I'd like to 
</I>&gt;<i> get a heads up and if I need to purchase a new one give myself some 
</I>&gt;<i> time to buy it online as opposed to going to the local spot, which 
</I>&gt;<i> would be more expensive. Also localize the problem to monitor, 
</I>&gt;<i> computer hardware, OS or something else.
