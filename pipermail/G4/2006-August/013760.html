When you did the upgrade to OS-X, did you do a total erasure of the  
drive? If you did, you lost your installed OS-9 which could have  
become your &quot;Classic&quot; environment for running legacy programs while  
booting into OS-X. I have seen that OS-X wants to do a full erasure  
before installing the OS and I believe that is because OS-X wants or  
needs to be the &quot;first in line&quot; in the drive boot sectors.

One work-around is to do a &quot;Clean Install&quot; of OS-9 onto your drive  
and then use the OS-X system preferences to select that OS folder as  
your Classic environment for running all your legacy programs.

Another work-around is to install OS-9 on a second drive and select  
it as your Classic environment instead of the first option. This  
would give you a second drive that could be used as a backup archive  
or as an emergency boot drive. Good benefits to have on hand.

Hope this helps.
