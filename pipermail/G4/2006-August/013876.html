<PRE>Hey, Nate,

I'm no expert on anything, but I've long had a similar problem with my 
533DP, running 10.3.9...  I have two 512MB PC133 DIMMs that I bought 
specifically because they were CL2, but System Profiler has never, ever 
recognised them for what they are.  It has consistently reported one as 
CL3 and the other as PC100!  I have no idea why this is, as I am either 
very certain they are premium RAM, or at least I have convinced myself 
they are.  They both say PC133, at least...

At any rate, I have heard that this is a rather common issue with Sys 
Pro, so I generally don't worry about it.

I am interested in finding out how your upgrade situation resolves, 
though, as I am leaning strongly towards one of the 1.8DP upgrades from 
Sonnet or Giga (weird:  they now look the same), as I can't afford a 
completely new machine and even if I could, kind of want to save my 
resources for whatever is available when or if CS3 ships...  Unless 
used G5's drop in price by about a thousand dollars between now and 
then, of course.

NAK

</I>&gt;<i> What's up with that? Any ideas?  OWC tech support is next on my list
