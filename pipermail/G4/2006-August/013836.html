Did you trying fixing permissions via Disk Utility?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Without a more detailed description it's hard to give you any  
feedback. You never say what actually went wrong with any of the non- 
OS9 installs. And did you literally mean &quot;rezero&quot; or just repartition?


&gt;<i> Having 99% of the system files hidden makes a lot of wasted space  
</I>&gt;<i> on my 40 gig HD. Of 3.8 gig of the files on the DVD only 198 meg of  
</I>&gt;<i> them are visible to the user.
</I>
Why do you think this is wasted space? What do you mean by hidden?  
Are you aware that you can customize the install to some extent?  
There's very little in OS X that's literally not visible from the  
finder or command line. (As opposed to Windows which does literally  
hide most of the system files from users - and that is a good thing.)  
It's all services that are used or potentially used by you directly,  
or indirectly via programs you install. Disk drives are almost free  
these days, if you need more space get another drive.

How did you arrive at the 198 MB figure and why do you care what's  
visible or not visible on an installation disc?


&gt;<i> The kernal written in Forth makes it hard to make changes or tweak  
</I>&gt;<i> things. But that must be why Mac's are the best computers on the  
</I>&gt;<i> market ( turns opened hand towards Apple for my tip)
</I>
The kernel is not written in Forth. The boot ROM (BIOS in PC terms)  
is. And Open Firmware is a much more powerful and flexible  
environment then a PC BIOS - you just have to know what you're doing.  
Open Firmware is thoroughly documented if you have the need and/or  
interest.
