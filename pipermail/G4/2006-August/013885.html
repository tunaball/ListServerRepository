<PRE>Greetings ( + )!( + )

If you got the firmware up-grade from Apple, when you tried to install 
the Up-grade it would have told you that it wasn't required if your 
machine didn't require or was inapplicable to your platform.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hey, Nate,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm no expert on anything, but I've long had a similar problem with my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 533DP, running 10.3.9...  I have two 512MB PC133 DIMMs that I bought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specifically because they were CL2, but System Profiler has never, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recognised them for what they are.  It has consistently reported one 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CL3 and the other as PC100!  I have no idea why this is, as I am 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very certain they are premium RAM, or at least I have convinced myself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they are.  They both say PC133, at least...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At any rate, I have heard that this is a rather common issue with Sys
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pro, so I generally don't worry about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am interested in finding out how your upgrade situation resolves,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though, as I am leaning strongly towards one of the 1.8DP upgrades 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sonnet or Giga (weird:  they now look the same), as I can't afford a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely new machine and even if I could, kind of want to save my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resources for whatever is available when or if CS3 ships...  Unless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used G5's drop in price by about a thousand dollars between now and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then, of course.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have a fussy computer (Quicksilver 2002 800 MHz originally, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> upgraded
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> processor to Sonnet 1.8GHz dual).  I get a lot of freezes, usually
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> while on the Internet or in the e-mail app on the Internet.  I ran
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> disk repair from another startup disk (fixed a lot of stuff) and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> disabled Classic, but still get the ocasional freeze--it fact i was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> kicked out twice while writing this.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I thought the problem might be because the System profiler reads the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> RAM at PC100.  It's OWC RAM, probably about 2 years old.  I didn't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> look at the chip, just figured maybe I bought cheap RAM to years ago
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and settled for PC100.   I called OWC Tech support and asked if that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> might cause a problem and they said it might, so I ordered 3 more PC
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 133 512MB chips, thinking I might sell the PC-100 to old iMac owners.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The chips came, I installed them and checked the profiler.  It still
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> read that the chips were PC-100!  I looked at the labels on the chips
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I removed, and they, too, were PC 133.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What's up with that? Any ideas?  OWC tech support is next on my list
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of calls.  I don't need 5 chips for three slots.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
