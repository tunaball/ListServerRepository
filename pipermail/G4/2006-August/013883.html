<PRE>Het, thanks for the responses, guys.  The problem is still ongoing.  I wouldn't care how the RAM was recognized if I did'nt get the system freeze an hour or so  into the run.  I have a friend who has the identical machine without the processor upgrade, and his recognized the RAM as PC133.  He's gonna lend me one of his chips to try in my machine.  I'll let you know how it turns out.

I'd like to hear from others who got the Sonnet 1.8 GHz dual processor upgrade.  It required a firmware upgrade before installation, and for that you had to boot into OS 9.  Now I'm wondering if the firmware upgrade was only required on the older G4s (mine is Quicksilver 2002).

Stay tuned.  I'll keep you posted.  Incidentally, the computer really flies (before it freezes...).

Nate

&gt;<i> Hey, Nate,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm no expert on anything, but I've long had a similar problem with my 
</I>&gt;<i> 533DP, running 10.3.9...  I have two 512MB PC133 DIMMs that I bought 
</I>&gt;<i> specifically because they were CL2, but System Profiler has never, ever 
</I>&gt;<i> recognised them for what they are.  It has consistently reported one as 
</I>&gt;<i> CL3 and the other as PC100!  I have no idea why this is, as I am either 
</I>&gt;<i> very certain they are premium RAM, or at least I have convinced myself 
</I>&gt;<i> they are.  They both say PC133, at least...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At any rate, I have heard that this is a rather common issue with Sys 
</I>&gt;<i> Pro, so I generally don't worry about it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am interested in finding out how your upgrade situation resolves, 
</I>&gt;<i> though, as I am leaning strongly towards one of the 1.8DP upgrades from 
</I>&gt;<i> Sonnet or Giga (weird:  they now look the same), as I can't afford a 
</I>&gt;<i> completely new machine and even if I could, kind of want to save my 
</I>&gt;<i> resources for whatever is available when or if CS3 ships...  Unless 
</I>&gt;<i> used G5's drop in price by about a thousand dollars between now and 
</I>&gt;<i> then, of course.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a fussy computer (Quicksilver 2002 800 MHz originally, upgraded 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; processor to Sonnet 1.8GHz dual).  I get a lot of freezes, usually 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while on the Internet or in the e-mail app on the Internet.  I ran 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disk repair from another startup disk (fixed a lot of stuff) and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disabled Classic, but still get the ocasional freeze--it fact i was 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kicked out twice while writing this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I thought the problem might be because the System profiler reads the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RAM at PC100.  It's OWC RAM, probably about 2 years old.  I didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; look at the chip, just figured maybe I bought cheap RAM to years ago 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and settled for PC100.   I called OWC Tech support and asked if that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might cause a problem and they said it might, so I ordered 3 more PC 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 133 512MB chips, thinking I might sell the PC-100 to old iMac owners.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The chips came, I installed them and checked the profiler.  It still 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; read that the chips were PC-100!  I looked at the labels on the chips 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I removed, and they, too, were PC 133.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What's up with that? Any ideas?  OWC tech support is next on my list 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of calls.  I don't need 5 chips for three slots.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
