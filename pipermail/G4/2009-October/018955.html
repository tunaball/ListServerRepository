Here's how I did it when going on vacation with some
notes afterward.

*  *  *

Well, there are a few ways to achieve that.  Probably the simplest
is to order the unsubscription kit described below.

First, ask your Internet Provider to mail you an Unsubscribing Kit.

Then follow these directions.

The kit will most likely be the standard no-fault type. Depending on
requirements, System A and/or System B can be used. When operating
System A, depress lever and a plastic dalkron unsubscriber will be
dispensed through the slot immediately underneath. When you have
fastened the adhesive lip, attach connection marked by the large &quot;X&quot;
outlet hose. Twist the silver- coloured ring one inch below the
connection point until you feel it lock.

The kit is now ready for use. The Cin-Eliminator is activated by the
small switch on the lip. When securing, twist the ring back to its
initial condition, so that the two orange lines meet. Disconnect.
Place the dalkron unsubscriber in the vacuum receptacle to the rear.
Activate by pressing the blue button.

The controls for System B are located on the opposite side. The red
release switch places the Cin-Eliminator into position; it can be
adjusted manually up or down by pressing the blue manual release
button. The opening is self- adjusting. To secure after use, press the
green button, which simultaneously activates the evaporator and
returns the Cin-Eliminator to its storage position.

You may log off if the green exit light is on over the evaporator.
If the red light is illuminated, one of the Cin-Eliminator
requirements has not been properly implemented. Press the &quot;List Guy&quot;
call button on the right of the evaporator . He will secure all
facilities from his control panel.

To use the Auto-Unsub, first undress and place all your clothes in the
clothes rack. Put on the velcro slippers located in the cabinet
immediately below. Enter the shower, taking the entire kit with you.
On the control panel to your upper right upon entering you will see a
&quot;Shower seal&quot; button. Press to activate. A green light will then be
illuminated immediately below. On the intensity knob, select the
desired setting. Now depress the Auto-Unsub activation lever. Bathe
normally.

The Auto-Unsub will automatically go off after three minutes unless
you activate the &quot;Manual off&quot; override switch by flipping it up. When
you are ready to leave, press the blue &quot;Shower seal&quot; release button.
The door will open and you may leave. Please remove the velcro
slippers and place them in their container.

If you prefer the ultrasonic log-off mode, press the indicated blue
button. When the twin panels open, pull forward by rings A &amp; B. The
knob to the left, just below the blue light, has three settings, low,
medium or high. For normal use, the medium setting is suggested.

After these settings have been made, you can activate the device by
switching to the &quot;ON&quot; position the clearly marked red switch. If
during the unsubscribing operation, you wish to change the settings,
place the &quot;manual off&quot; override switch in the &quot;OFF&quot; position. You may
now make the change and repeat the cycle. When the green exit light
goes on, you may log off and have lunch. Please close the door behind
you.

Or you can go to <A HREF="http://www.Onelist.com">http://www.Onelist.com</A>
Sign in
Unsub from the list of Lists that you are subscibed to.

Notes:
1: I filed a complaint about the shower time being
   too short especially when the intensity knob is set to
   the lower settings.  You'll have to turn it up to one
   of the highest two settings if you wish to have that
   short of a time be enough.  They told me that the
   controls would be upgraded in the next kit version.

2: The ultrasonic log-off mode really didn't work that
   good until I figured out that they meant it to be
   tried after using the original method.  At least they
   took the time to put in an alternate method since the
   first one was quite nearly useless.

3: Be careful not to get the kit wet in the shower.
   A buddy nearly electrocuted himself with one of his
   roomates when they both tried it at the same time.

4: I really only wanted to unsubscribe temporarily, so
   it turned out to work very well for my specific
   circumstances.  For those that need to unsubscribe
   permanently, I suggest the deluxe kit that is not
   mentioned until after completing instructions in
   the basic kit.  You might as well order both the
   basic one, and the deluxe one at the same time to
   make it a permanent thing.  I think the deluxe kit
   will set you back about $2170, but its worth the
   price to get them out of your hair if you really
   want to go that route.

Good Luck
Don
