<PRE>Hello,
I recently installed two OWC 1.2 Ghz processor upgrades in G4 
sawtooths. Both installed without a problem, and they both have been 
running flawlessly for three months. The customer service at OWC is 
second to none; I ordered them at 7PM on Friday and they were delivered 
on Monday. The speed of the two machines is of course, vastly improved.
