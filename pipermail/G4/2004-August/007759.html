I have an OWC mercury and a sonnet.
OWC has more options some of which might be incompatible.
My OWC was sold as a 1.26g.  FCP only sees 1.26 as 600 because of ASP. 
This greatly confuses FCP4.
At 1.33 it screams for most things but fails on renders.
So I run it at 1.2.  Trouble free fast and stable.
The sonnet (my second) works good and requires no set up or thinking 
about it.
  But it does take a bit of software on my machine which must be 
upgraded sometimes.
So all in all they both work but the Sonnet is easier.
Jim
