<PRE>I think you have to believe what you know.  I'd take the bad display to a
repair shop.  Wonder if pulling the plug could be enough to induce an
electrical voltage surge or dip through the USB connection?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> HERE's where things get fuzzy. My wireless base station is a Netgear 802.11g

</I>&gt;<i> my Al PB, and with the Airport card in my son's TiBook. HOWEVER, when I
</I>&gt;<i> bought and installed an Airport card in the G4 Dual 1 GHz, NOTHING I could
</I>&gt;<i> do would make the dual G4 &quot;see&quot; the wireless router. I verified that the
</I>&gt;<i> card was good (swapped it with the one in the TiBook). I decided that the
</I>&gt;<i> antenna must be the problem, so I decided to put an 802.11g PCI card in the
</I>&gt;<i> dual 1 GHz G4. I installed the card with the computer plugged in (for
</I>&gt;<i> grounding) but powered down. As I installed the card (a Motorola card sold
</I>&gt;<i> for PCs only but claimed to work on multiple Mac forums), the computer
</I>&gt;<i> started booting. I pulled the power cord to stop booting and completed the
</I>&gt;<i> card installation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, when I plug the monitor connector into the computer, it starts to boot
</I>&gt;<i> and the &quot;sleep&quot; LED on the right lower corner of the monitor bezel glows
</I>&gt;<i> brightly. The computer emits the single long monotone that says &quot;hosed
</I>&gt;<i> motherboard,&quot; and it won't boot. I took the PCI wireless card back out but
</I>&gt;<i> nothing changed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now here's where things get REALLY weird. I decided that perhaps there was a
</I>&gt;<i> hardware incompatibility between the Mac's video card and the PCI networking
</I>&gt;<i> card, and perhaps I'd hosed the G4's video card, but just to be certain, I
</I>&gt;<i> tried plugging the G4 dual into my other 17&quot; studio display, AND IT BOOTS111
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I tried plugging my G5 dual into the studio display that isn't playing
</I>&gt;<i> nice, and the G5 emits the warning motherboard monotone!!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, it appears that installing the PCI networking card has somehow done
</I>&gt;<i> something bad not to the video card, but to the Studio Display itself. Does
</I>&gt;<i> this make any sense? Any suggestions what I should do next?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any guesses MORE than welcome!
