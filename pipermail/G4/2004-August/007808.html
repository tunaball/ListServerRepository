<PRE>A happy ending (OK, the chorus hasn't sung yet, but...)

I took my Apple 17&quot; LCD into the nearest Apple Store and waited two hours to
talk to a Genius. I related my story and he agreed it was quite obviously a
hardware problem. He confirmed it by plugging my monitor into one of their
G5 display CPUs. (I didn't ask him to do that, and just his willingness to
do so impressed me as far as &quot;customer service&quot; orientation is concerned) He
said he'd never seen anything like it, but said he'd check to see how much
it would cost to diagnose and service it.

First thing he did was confirm that the standard warranty period had
expired. I knew it was older than that :-)

Then he said he'd look up the repair cost. He plugged in the serial number
again and then smiled and said the magic word - &quot;Applecare&quot;.

Turns out they'd convinced me to buy it when I purchased the G4. So, I fly
off for a family vacation, my display flies off to wherever Apple services
them, and we meet back in the Sonoma Wine Country when I return in a week.

Life is good.
