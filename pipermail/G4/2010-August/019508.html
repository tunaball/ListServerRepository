Ron Steinke accurately suggested...

My first suspicion was also that a ramstick might be
bad.

The sticks were fine and the board was bad.

I did indeed (finally today) do a test by pulling the
ramsticks one by one.  Nothing changed a bit after
trying most any combo of one or two sticks.

So, took a spare machine with bad power supply and
good mobo, threw all the ramsticks into it, made one
working machine out of two, and she fired up happily.

Proof positive that the sticks are happy.

Not much left of the dead dog to salvage except maybe
a processor, fan, and speaker.  Will need to take a
look to see if processors are even compatible though.
Might confiscate those out and toss what's left.

It was a bit of downgrade since the first machine was
at 600 mhz, and the second is at 400, ... and am a bit
reluctant to switch processors &lt;even if they can&gt; in
case that is the real problem.

I didn't do a lookup to see what the info says about
compatability, so no attempt at even entertaining a
processor change until more homework.

So, I'll be doing a lookup in the next day or two and
go from there, but at least the X machine is happily
marching on.

Thanks for the assistance.
Don



There cannot be a crisis this week
