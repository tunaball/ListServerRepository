<PRE>Hello Eric,

I had the same problem.  First the Oahu Apple Store, and subsequently  
a local shop named MacMouse Club couldn't fix it.  I lost $1627.73  
because MacMouse Club parted out my broken Firewire 400 MDD, and  
switched it with a Firewire 800 that couldn't run my OS9 type  
software, without getting my consent before doing the switch.  The  
problem Frankensteined into a GREAT BIG HASSLE!  Sigh.

My educated guess is that you might have an erratic power supply  
problem because that was the only part both the Oahu Apple Store and  
MacMouse Club didn't replace.  The logic board was changed by the  
Oahu Apple Store.  My hypothesis is that when the power supply  
stutters for just a fraction of a second, the CPU freezes or panics.

Perhaps you can hook your power supply up to an oscilloscope and look  
at the wave form while the power supply is under a load.  When there  
is no load, the wave form might be fine.  However, when the power  
supply is running the fan and the CPU, the wave form might break down.

Aloha from Oahu,

Bruce
