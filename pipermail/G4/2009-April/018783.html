<PRE>Thank you Harry, Tom, Eric, Richard and John for your comments and suggestions.

One
thing I forgot to mention in my earlier post is that I almost always
have a problem playing videos.&#160; They will play for a short time,
between one and one and a half minutes, and then I get the circle of
spinning circles in the center of the frame, as though it's loading,
and it never stops.&#160; This is a real problem, because in my duties as an
admin on my message board I need to view and comment on many videos.

I just had a typical problem.&#160; If you can tell me which log to look in, and/or what might be significant, I can post it.&#160; I don't want to clog up the list with a bunch of stuff that might be irrelevant.

In any event, here is what happened.&#160; I left the computer on with a couple finder windows open where I had been looking at various logs, but no applications running.&#160; I was gone about six hours.&#160; I came home and moved the mouse to wake up the computer.&#160; The screen came up and it looked fine.&#160; Although I could move the cursor, everything was non-responsive.&#160; Couldn't click on anything at all.&#160; I hit the little button below the power button to restart the machine (the reset button?).&#160; It came back up and everything was fine, but I know you are not supposed to do that often.&#160; I've had to do it so much the last couple months.&#160; The problems seemed to start around the time the original hard drive died. It has been replaced and the problem continues, though less often.

Thanks again,
Andrea
