</I>&gt;<i> -Shadra

</I>First question that comes to my mind is, why did you order a SCSI  
card? It's useful for hooking up SCSI drives and other devices, such  
as scanners. It's not the best way to upgrade a system since there  
are SATA cards available for getting large, fast, modern drives  
installed.

Aside from that though, you can use networking to get the files  
moved. You could even just transfer your entire home folder from one  
to the other. Bear in mind this won't transfer the old user account,  
but you could take all of the folders from the old home folder and  
put them into your other computer's home.

It sounds like you know how to get them networked together, since you  
have the G3 acting as a router, if I understand your message  
correctly. Do you intend to continue using the G3 as your router (aka  
internet hub) after the files are moved? If so, sounds like you can  
just transfer files and move the systems around (in no particular  
order) and just make sure you keep the network connections similar to  
how they have been, so that the G3 can continue to do its job.

If there's more to it than that, please elaborate. I'd be glad to  
offer what assistance I can.

Eric
