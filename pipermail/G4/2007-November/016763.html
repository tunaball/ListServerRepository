<PRE>Greetings Kenneth ( + )!( + )

This is very good news, your solution may have something to do with 
what I read about those drives (more than likely somewhere in the IDE 
control) could protect data. What I read from Hitachi was that you 
needed a special WINTEL program to remove those protection schemes. 
However I didn't think that the protection would be in effect when the 
drive were installed in a Mac.

My question, and I don't remember is you have already said but when 
when you installed the SATA drive did you install a SATA control card 
or did you use a SATA to ATA converter and then connect that to the 
ribbon cable that Apple provided for the front drive bays. If you 
installed a SATA PCI control card then it should make any difference 
whether the drive is in the front bay or the back.

If you have &quot;Xbench&quot; run the application to find out how fast your 
drives are responding. If the drives (180 Gb) in the rear bays are 
responding faster then you may want to swap their positions.

Congratulation on your solution.

Best regards,

</I>&gt;<i> place for media storage. The problem I presented to you guys was that 
</I>&gt;<i> both the old drives were now showing that they were about 72 % full, 
</I>&gt;<i> when they were supposed to be formatted and &quot;empty.&quot;  Due to my

</I>&gt;<i> options for more thorough erasing, I picked the &quot;7-pass&quot; option and 
</I>&gt;<i> now both disks appear to be showing the accurate capacity and 
</I>&gt;<i> functioning normally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to all of your information and suggestions, and the research 
</I>&gt;<i> that I did as a result, I had a major learning experience.  I learned 
</I>&gt;<i> that the technology of my mirrored door G4 represented a significant 
</I>&gt;<i> technical plug-and-play milestone by Apple toward rendering 
</I>&gt;<i> insignificant the master/slave jumper settings.  I also learned that 
</I>&gt;<i> the new serial ATA drives were manufactured to accommodate the new 
</I>&gt;<i> plug and play technology.  There seems to be a consensus of 
</I>&gt;<i> information that connections for drives mounted in the front tray make 
</I>&gt;<i> the G4 operate a little slower than the rear tray connections.  Mine 
</I>&gt;<i> now seems a little slower.  My new question is this:  If I move the 
</I>&gt;<i> 750 GB Seagate, with the OS on it, from the front to the rear tray, 
</I>&gt;<i> and move one of the rear IBM drives in the rear tray to the front,  
</I>&gt;<i> will my computer still recognize the Seagate as my startup disk, and 
</I>&gt;<i> boot up, or will there just be a smoky hole in the ground where my 
</I>&gt;<i> computer was?
