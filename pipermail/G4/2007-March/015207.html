<PRE>Hello:

I'm trying to set up a G4533 as a dedicated audio player. In another 
life the machine ran well on Panther as an administrative machine 
until recently when I decided to install Tiger. The machine has 768Mb 
of RAM.

I took out the CD writer that the box came with and installed a DVD 
writer so I could install Tiger straight from the install disk. The 
install was successful but I cannot get the machine to boot off the 
startup disk. (FYI: the disk is not partitioned). All I get is the 
apple logo on a grey screen but no loading wheel. It hangs in 
otherwords.

I've tried a couple of things.
- forced the machine to choose a startup disk by holding down option on startup
- zapped my PRAM
- removed the orange micro scsi card that was installed in the box 
and tried to boot
- installed Tiger twice

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Cheers,
James
