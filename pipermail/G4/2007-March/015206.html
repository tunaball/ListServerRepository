<PRE>Hi,

I want you thank you all for the help you've given me.  I've now got 
everything properly installed and even downloaded a few simple games to 
play... sudoku, patience, mahjong, etc. I also plugged in mydigital camara 
and donloaded some photos... so much easier using iphoto... no driver discs 
to mess about with.  So I'm set up for a while.  Once I've found my way 
around a bit more I'll take a look at the command Line in Mac as well.  I 
will definately be visiting the forums and reading the info in the links 
you've provided me with as well as hanging around here and annoying you with 
silly questions occassionally. :)

Here in the UK I would estimate 90 - 95% of all computers are PCs.  In fact 
until I got this one I had never actually seen a Mac in real life.  I had 
always considered them an over-priced poor cousin of the PC, but then I was 
judging them by PC standards... MS indoctrination? I now realise that Macs 
are far more durable and long-lived than PCs and even the old ones are 
pretty powerful compared to a PC of the same era (I definately need to know 
more about the chip and motherboard architecture)... try running XP or Vista 
on a 1999 built PC... huh, I think not!

As a CompTIA A+ Cetified PC technician my livelihood depends on my knowledge 
of PCs, so switching entirely is not an option, but I would definately like 
a newer Mac at some point and adding them to my repertoire certainly can't 
hurt... and I have to say I think the AppleCare Technician's Training is 
very well priced compared to MS, and I might just do it at a later date just 
for my own interest.  I can imagine I'll end up as PCs for work but Mac for 
fun.

And I'll report back what I think of the Switch 101.

Celia
