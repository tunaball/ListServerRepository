I found that using a powered hub and leaving power on it all the time, even when the computer is shut down, the problem went away.

I use an ADB keyboard (matches the one on this 8500) with a Griffin converter to USB and with the new hub I can't start up from the keyboard any more even though the adapter is plugged into the USB socket that the hub isn't. Fortunately the button on the computer is in the front and the CD-ROM tray doesn't bump my fingers when I poke it.

Apple DOES know about the problem and it almost surely needs yet another update to firmware, I'll bet you had to update firmware to run OS neXt and that's when the problems began.

Sawteeth are old dentistry.  Sigh.
