<PRE>Hello all, and thank you for your time.  I've been unemployed for a  
while, but have come across opportunities to work with Macs on a few  
occasions.  One place was well established and dealt with nothing but  
Macs while another was a computer shop that covered Macs and PCs.   
Both places wanted someone who had their certification or was working  
toward it.  The trouble is, how does one get this type of  
certification without having to pay for Apple's courses?  The PC  
platform has various certifications, and one does not have to go  
through Microsoft to get it, so what gives?

As I said I'm unemployed right now, and living in the Pittsburgh PA  
area I don't know of any colleges that give Apple certifications.  I  
graduated from Computer Tech in 1999, which is now known by a  
different name and focuses on design rather than computer programming  
and platform knowledge.  I've worked on various Macs from the  
Classic, to laptops, to four models in between to my current G4  
Digital Audio, and even replaced the battery on my iPod.  I've  
disassembled and repaired two digital cameras as well.  When the  
Apple Store first opened in the area I was one of the few to get the  
first phone call but not the second.  After applying in December I  
didn't get a call back from them despite having more experience than  
the last time.  I'm also a writer and Volunteer Coordinator for  
Macinstruct.com.

So what does it take?  I'm not going back to school because I already  
have two associates degrees, and I'm not working again while going to  
school only because my grades weren't the best because of having to  
split the time.  I  believe that my Mac hardware troubleshooting will  
only be a hobby and not a career because I don't have the  
certification.  Sometimes I even regret choosing the Mac solely based  
on the lack of opportunities out there.  So what does it take?  This,  
by all means, is not a cry for help.  I want to get a job based on  
merit and experience, not because i know someone in the industry.   
Can anyone please give me pointers?  I appreciate everyone's time and  
input.

Eric Buczynski
</PRE>
