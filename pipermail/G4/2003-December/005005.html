<PRE>James,

The comparison between cable and DSL is different in each location.

DSL in my town is rated at the MINIMUM speed, and I average 1.2Mbps to
1.5Mbps, typically.

However, cable here is rated according to the MAXIMUM speed. As a result,
most people in this town are getting 600 to 700 Kbps from cable.

&gt;<i>From your experience, you can only conclude that in your location the cable
</I>company provides greater throughput than the DSL company there. But you
can't reach the sweeping generalizations you've been posting here.


Brian Conner

That is interesting. I also had verizon DSL. It kicked me around badly 
in  the daytime when the big companies were on and was only marginally 
better at night.
Speeds were only a little faster than a modem and frustration was the 
rule. Plus it didn't like OS9.
Now I have cablevision and optimum online and pay $35 per month for my 
connection instead of $50 outright. It's a deal.
The world is on my desktop and in my living room and any information 
can be had quickly.
DSL was not so good and I dropped it the MINUTE cable became available 
in my town.
The only caveat is to keep it secret from too many nieghbors. Believe me
there was a day when I had both. I tested. The tests did not 
lie. Cable rules.
  WAtch  TV too and it's cheaper. I need Nickelodeon anyway.
