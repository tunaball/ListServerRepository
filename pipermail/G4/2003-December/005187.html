It's not me but  Dale S. who is looking for older mac stuff. I am 
offering my older software, much of it suitable and educational for 
preschoolers, to him .
Much of this stuff I have already tried to sell on ebay, with poor 
results.
If they are going to make it available to little kids who might not 
have a computer,
  I am with that. Story CD's,Rugrats game, Reader Rabbit, and just all 
kinds of games.
My daughter learned to read on the 7600.
Microsoft office and Powerpoint . Where did I get those? I don't even 
remember.
Excuse me if I hold back Riven.
Take it please. Sounds like a reasonable thing.
Jim
