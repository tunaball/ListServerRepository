<PRE>Have to agree - once in OSX you will not want OS9 ever again, unless 
you absolutely need it.  I have not seen a frozen system since leaving 
9 for 10.2.  10.3 has font management built in but I have not tried it 
yet - heard it was adaquate.  I suggest you add a new drive to your 
computer with OSX on it or partition your current drive and install OS9 
on one and OSX on the other and begin using X and Classic.  You can 
boot into 9 if you need to.  Sort of the best of both worlds.  Check 
ebay for your program updates - I saved goobs of dough by purchasing 
upgrade versions and/or full versions of nearly every Adobe program I 
need via ebay.  M$ Office is expensive, even on ebay, but at least a 
bit more palatable.

</I>&gt;<i> be

</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> font manager but it is too buggy at this point and will never be good
</I>&gt;<i> for professional work. You should plan to go to OS X 10.3 and try to
</I>&gt;<i> update Quark to 6 as soon as you can, although it works fine in 
</I>&gt;<i> Classic.
</I>&gt;<i> OR Adobe might make a move to InDesign CS very attractive. I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> if you will want FR before or after Quark, but I recommend going to OSX
</I>&gt;<i> before buying font management software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A 2.x version of Disk Warrior will work fine for Panther for quit

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I work mostly out of Quark 5.0; and don&#185;t have enough funds to update

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
