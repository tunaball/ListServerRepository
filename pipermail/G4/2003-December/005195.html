<PRE>Kevin,

What you will need is a Wireless Access-point which you have already  
chosen the &quot;Linksys wireless broadband G router&quot;. In addition to that  
you will need to add wireless cards to all the computers that you want  
to use wirelessly. For the G4 you can simply buy an apple airport card,  
or perhaps a PCI or USB based wireless connection method. For the HP  
you can purchase a PCI based wireless card or a USB based wireless  
adapter.

Once you have all of you computers wireless ready, Configure the  
wireless router (easier said than done), Get all of you computers on to  
your wireless network, turn on file sharing on the PC and the Mac and  
you are all set to share files.

Keep in mind that your wireless file sharing will take a (2 times  
slower and beyond)  performance hit when compared to 100 base wired  
ethernet.  This is the case with the older 802.11b standards such as  
that will be in your G4 if you use the Apple AirPort card. The The G  
spec wireless is faster than b spec but it is still going to be slower  
than wired ethernet. With normal web browsing the speed difference is  
not noticeable; however, large file transfers will be noticeable  
slower. If you plan to transfer large files frequently over 100 MB you  
should consider going with wired ethernet. The ethernet cables are not  
hard to install you can run them through the walls/ floor. You can also  
use the existing holes in home (EX. Near Cold Air returns, Heating  
ducts, power outlets) to run the ethernet wires along side of. So  
consider the wire method, it may be worth it if you need the speed.

Some other solutions for &quot;better&quot; performance :::

1. Consider directly connecting just the G4 to the Wireless router.  
This will give the G4 a 100 Base ethernet connection that will only be  
limited in terms file-sharing by how fast the Wireless G connection is  
to the HP.

2. Also another solution is to use you houses AC power outlets as a  
network connection completely removing to the need to use wireless.  
With AC to Ethernet Adapters.
