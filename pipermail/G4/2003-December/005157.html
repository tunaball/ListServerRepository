I'm new so perhaps shouldn't comment...but hey! The worst that can 
happen is I get bumped, right? ;  )

The man lost a valuable collection. It wouldn't have happened if he'd 
made the back-ups he was entitled to make.

There is no &quot;should&quot; or &quot;shouldn't&quot; concerning legality...Yes---we CAN 
be too careful. This is a case of overblown concern for legality, and 
if the list-parent (I don't know who it is---it could be the person who 
felt discussing this was reprehensible...) has an issue with this being 
discussed then I guess that is that. If the list- parent doesn't have 
an issue--------then what's the problem?

I hope the poor guy takes up his beloved hobby, makes copies, saves 
them elsewhere, and he gets his hobby back.

Whoooie! Not an appropriate comment for a mailing list?

It's part and parcel of the whole internet world right now. It's under 
discussion EVERYwhere.

Well, I guess I've made my beliefs pretty clear! Don't know why I felt 
so compelled to write.

Rich---I hope you DO pick back up on your hobby that makes you 
happy...and by all means make a backup copy so yet another &quot;small 
death&quot; doesn't befall you...

Good luck!

<A HREF="http://crazedcowboys.com">http://crazedcowboys.com</A>  &lt;---We sell our original CDs. Online. Some 
people are going to copy them for friends or for KaZaa or Limewire. 
&lt;shrug&gt; That's life in this day and age. Far more people pay for their 
CDs, or pay for the download of a song. We just don't sweat it, and try 
to keep up with the ever-changing landscape of life on the web...Itunes 
proved that people are willing to pay.
