Ebay also carries some VERY inexpensive older software, often as low as 
a dollar...it's quick and very easy to do. I haven't searched for these 
items, but have seen them and there are MANY!

I just tried Ebay, after thinking it was a complicated, difficult 
procedure---but I was wrong. I just regained my interest in speaking 
and reading French, but had no $bucks$ to buy the neat kits I saw at 
Borders, etc. ---  and for about $20 I now have more French 
teaching/learning/CD's/tapes/lessons/books than I could even imagined 
existed. All it took was a few clicks, and all have been just as good 
quality as promised.

I'd say get as much free as you can, then if you need more---try 
Ebay.com
