<PRE>in the US, it is &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; right?  if email lists 
would be limited to discussion of topics that cannot involve illegal 
activity, there would be no discussion.

-cars can be driven illegally
-cars can be modified to an illegal extent
-computer application can be illegal
-obtaining of computers software can be done illegally
-software can be installed illegally


and the list goes on.

I saw nothing in Rich's questions that pointed to anything explicitly 
illegal, rather, my first thought was that he is someone exactly like 
me who has invested thousands of dollars into software, music, movies, 
etx and simply wants to ensure that the products purchased will outlive 
the fragile existence of the media on which they were produced. (we all 
preach the necessity of multiple backups, but then deny someone the 
knowledge of how to backup???)  i know cds and dvds are inherently 
fragile, thus the reason i duplicate every one i buy, and never use the 
original. maybe if corporations would allow free replacement of damaged 
disks, this wouldnt be necessary.... (i know that cant (wont) happen, 
so i continue to backup)
