<PRE>Hi,

I've got a Palm m500 running with Palm Desktop 2.6.3 and I've used it
successfully
for more than a year with both my Mac G4 and my iBook G3 laptop. Suddenly,
though,
it will not Hotsync with my G4 and I can't reinstall with my original
software disks.
I emailed Palm Support and they told me to reinstall. I did d/l another
copy of the
software from their site which won't reinstall either. The message is &quot;Did
not complete
the install. Would you like to cancel or try again?&quot;

Anyone had a problem like this before? I wanted to get version 2.6.3 working so
I would have a backup while upgrading to 4.0 on the laptop, but maybe my next
step will be to try to install 4.0.

I actually did attempt a Palm 4.0 install several weeks ago, but had to
de-install
when it could not update the handheld in OSX. The whole thing made me nervous.
I would be willing to submit a screen shot if any of you were interested in
seeing
the loose files I have in System 9 and X that are associated with Palm and
letting
me know which I could delete - I don't want to damage my OS by deleting
anything
that might be integral.

Palm email support says they won't do any more email support; I have to
call them
for a minimum $25 fee :@(

Many thanks in advance. You sure are nice people for not yelling at me more
last
week.
