Not to be a killjoy but I think you have made a bad mistake.
9.2 is made to work in conjunction with a mixed OSX OS9 system .
I could not even install it on my G3 older system.
Back down to 9.0 and then do 9.1.  9.1 will stabilize you.
YMMV

Yo!

I seldom say anything on the List but this time I felt compelled to do so.

I had a lot of problems with 9.0.  I switched to 9.0.4 which was more 
stable, then 9.1 which was even better.  Then I felt I had to have the very 
latest so switched to 9.2.1, which was included in my OSX 10.1 box.  10.1 
was terrible and I quickly used it as a Frisbee but 9.2.1 worked great!  
Then I thought I had to have 9.2.2 and that was a total disaster even with 
10.2.8.  I went back to 9.2.1 which I use both as a Carbon partner for 
10.2.8 on a partition AND as my main OS for all the drives and cpu's I use 
for the majority of my graphics work.

In my judgement OS 9.2.1 is by far the most solid performer Apple has ever 
produced.  I use it on the following cpu's with not one problem:  G4; G3; 
8500, 9600 and 6500.

Maybe the particular CD that came with 10.1 is just superior?  I don't know.
