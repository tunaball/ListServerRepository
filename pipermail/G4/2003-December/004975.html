&gt;<i>What program and version, please?
</I>
Tracker, many apologies for not being specific. I had previously
provided specifics in a thread re: Palm Question and followed
all the advice folks gave me.

I was hoping for some OS-specific tips in a general way,
what kinds of things prevent successful installs? I told it
to ignore antivirus software in the install.

&gt;<i>Did you do a search of the hard drive for ALL of the different parts of the
</I>&gt;<i>original installation?
</I>
Yes, and even called Apple to make sure I wasn't eliminating anything that
was part of Jaguar.

&gt;<i>Have you made any changes to your OS lately? Did you add something else just
</I>&gt;<i>before the program quit working for you? What has changed significantly from
</I>&gt;<i>the past configuration?
</I>
Nothing. (Well, there must be something, but what?) Only change was taking
the machine to the factory for a fan replacement, and in the interim using
the exact same program on the laptop. I've done this many times before,
when I'm out of town. Copy User Files to other machine, carry on.

I had attempted an upgrade several weeks earlier, but the PDA could not be
updated using that version, so I de-installed, but the software worked fine
for quite a while after that. So I'm thinking that's not it. Yes, I have de-
installed ALL files I can see from a Find on Palm for either previous install.

&gt;<i>Device? What device? I thought you were asking for help with a software
</I>&gt;<i>program that wouldn't complete an installation. &quot;Device&quot; is a totally
</I>&gt;<i>different
</I>&gt;<i>matter.
</I>
Here's info from my other post:

I've got a Palm m500 running with Palm Desktop 2.6.3 and I've used it
successfully for more than a year with both my Mac G4 and my iBook G3 laptop.
Suddenly, though, it will not Hotsync with my G4 and I can't reinstall with
my original
software disks. All works fine on the laptop. (The PDA itself is running
Palm 4.0.
Both versions came with the PDA.)

I emailed Palm Support and they told me to reinstall using software from their
site. This won't install either. Error message is &quot;Did not complete the
install. Would
you like to cancel or try again?&quot; I re-contacted Palm that their suggestion
did not work
but they will not help me further without a $25 phone call.

Many thanks for any ideas you may have.
