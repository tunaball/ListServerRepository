</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Let me know...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Also if you have any idea on resurrecting the old tower, let me  
</I>&gt;<i> know... but I'm pretty knowledgeable about computer innards and no  
</I>&gt;<i> combination of things got the machine to boot, whether from internal  
</I>&gt;<i> drive, firewire drive, CD/DVD, or anything else.  The battery and  
</I>&gt;<i> firmware are fine since the initial sequence works, but the post- 
</I>&gt;<i> firmware boot, when the CPU needs to run, doesn't work, which is why  
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect the mobo.)

	As I think back over my 11 years of electronic servicing something  
here sounds familiar. That of turning off a product to find that it  
can't start back again. What I have experienced in the past are filter  
capacitors which get old and dried out. The internal resistance climbs  
and the end result are caps that can't filter very well and feel hot  
to the touch. Eventually they fail to function. Usually these  
exhausted caps are in the power supply and using an oscilloscope you  
can check if ripples are being filtered. If not then the electronics  
are subjected to said ripple as well with the overall result of less  
voltage for the electronics with an AC signal riding on the DC  
voltage. Microprocessors just hate that kind of environment and can  
burn up. If you attempt to read, lets say the 12 volt line with a hand  
held volt meter it would lie and say 12 v. Because a volt meter  
displays an average voltage only and can't read the high frequency AC  
signal. Thus the desire for an oscilloscope. To know for sure the  
power supply needs to be substituted with a known good one, or the  
output voltages substituted. I use to put an external adjustable  
voltage on the output of such a supply and kick it up a tad (no more  
then .5v usually) If life could be brought to the device then I knew  
caps in the power supply were a problem.

	You can check caps by touching the tops of them, those which have an  
imprinted cross on them. That imprint is actually the vent cap. When a  
cap is going to explode the vent cap expands and opens up. That way  
the gasses inside the cap can be released without the explosion. You  
can look for just such a situation by leaving your computer unplugged,  
open up the power supply and feel if these caps have a raised top. If  
so they have been hot and are expanding. They are defective and must  
be replaced. This method isn't fool proof but only helps to catch the  
worst of the bunch. Such caps usually have the plastic wrapping which  
has turned color or looks too small for the canister they surround.  
Again a function of too much heat. You can also look on the mother  
board as well for raised tops on these electrolytic capacitors. The  
only solution is replacement of the capacitor.

A thought for you

Kristen
