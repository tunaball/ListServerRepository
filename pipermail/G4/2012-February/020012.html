<PRE>Dear G4 list,

It was written:

&gt;<i> I think you might have intended to say SSL instead of referring to SSH
</I>&gt;<i> (Secure Shell)?
</I>
Yes. I was distracted (frustrated) when I wrote the original.

That excerpt was actually one from a WriteNow file I was going to print out
and hand to my Bank's officer some day. I haven't gotten around to it, and
seeing as my info was off by one letter, I'm glad I didn't.

Many thanks for catching the one-letter error. I will correct it and hand
that letter in soon.

And:

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> I don't see anything here related to the launch of Camino. I do see
</I>&gt;<i> this Clean My Mac helper app working, and Spoltight (running MDS
</I>&gt;<i> process) crashing. So it appears a problem with indexing, not that I
</I>&gt;<i> should think a system crash would result from that, but it does imply
</I>&gt;<i> a problem
</I>
You should be able to have Spotlight delete all the indexing files, then
start afresh. Ooops, that was Sherlock, sorry. I guess you'll have to find a
different utility to do that in X.
...
Aha! Try to find the Freeware 'Maintenance.app', as it has a 'Reset:
Spotlight index' item. I have vers 1.1.8 of it, which was listed with some
other AppleScript front-end to UNIX scripting freeware Mac OS(UNI)X apps.

May I also suggest getting and installing AppleJack. Once you read the
AppleJack read-me, you'll find it's a UNIX script that allows one to run
UNIX utilities in Single-User mode, before the whole System loads.


I *am* tired of being told to upgrade by overengineered web sites, and it
has been happening since 1995, but my 'upgrades' are usually several years
'behind the times' anyway because used equipemnt doesn't become affordable
(to me) until it's almost out of date. It's not a shoe-string budget, it's a
dental-floss budget...

Cheers

I was a Mac user when beleaguered Apple was doomed.
