There are also some sites I go to that need plugins, and they have PPC versions, for now at least.

Darryl,

	Not that I have the answer to all of your questions but I find myself in a similar situation since I'm running an older G4 Mystic. While TenFourFox states they do not support Flash with their browser and their not going to and blah,blah. If your enter in the address bar 'about:config' and then say 'yes, I'll be careful' to the warning page, you will enter the configuration database for FireFox. In those configurations locate the parts about FireFox and Flash and simply enable the boolean (set to true). And Flash will work just fine. I am using flash version 10.1 as provided by Adobe. With no problems or warnings. The thing is I haven't tried going to Netflix but this works with youtube.com and espn.com just fine. There are many other configuration settings you might like to peruse as well. TenForFox is still heavy on my computer so when I desire something a bit more lightweight I might use Camino. It lacks all the nice add-on's but loads quicker. Of course Safari always works out well, less the desired add-ons I get with FireFox. I did do a short personal trial and stream video from espn.com using TenFourFox, Camino, and Safari. It's interesting but TenFourFox did out preform the other two slightly. While Camino and Safari seemed the same.

	Speaking of flash, there is a GNU Linux project called Nash which is a software alternative to Adobe's Flash. It really isn't always successful on Linux but there is a port to OS X. I haven't tried that port since Adobe's Flash seems to work well for my needs. I toss that out there should you wish to investigate Nash and give it a try. If you do I would love to hear what your experience is.

	Since Sun sold OpenOffice to Oracle and now Oracle wishes to provide the base for free with future plans of selling any enhancements, I have dropped OpenOffice. I have followed the developers who did the same and now run the most current version of LibreOffice. That project is under current development whereas OpenOffice, as I understand it is not.

I am no help to you with Silverlight. It's Microsoft stuff and thus does not belong (my strong bias). Tell the website your visiting that you will not utilize them until they rid themselves of Silverlight. I don't hesitate to email the webmaster and let them know my thoughts about such interfaces. Sometimes they actually care. But that's me.

Kristen
