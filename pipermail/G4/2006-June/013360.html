mgilman didn't say what type of media he was trying to read or even  
what type of file he was trying to play so I gave him the best   
generic advice I could. Having the latest firmware is a good idea,  
but lacking any other information I just assumed that he could see  
the drive and it's contents, but that Quicktime or DVD Player  
wouldn't play it.

Patchburn doesn't have anything to do with play back. Quoting from  
the FAQ:

	Q: Does PatchBurn 3 give me support for viewing video DVDs?
	A: No, all reading capabilities are enabled in Mac-OS X by default.
	PatchBurn has no influence on that. If your drive does not read
	DVDs or CDs, there must be another hardware problem e.g. wrong
	jumper settings, defective cable or defective drive.

Older DVD drives had various problems with various flavors of write- 
able medial, but the DVD110D that mgilman has is only one release old  
and certainly reads all current DVD media.
