<PRE>I must add my $.02 worth here, it's been gnawing at me for a bit.  
Please wait patiently for this short rant to be delivered.

I, too, regard the current display of ignorance or rebellion by many  
(young?) people as a severe sign of disrespect to the majority of  
elder citizens in our country.

I was taught to regard my national language as something that would  
allow me to progress and develop my intelligence. I find the current  
trend of sloppiness and carelessness in language and grammar to be  
almost unacceptable in ordinary circumstances.

I say &quot;almost&quot; because I will not tilt at windmills attempting to  
correct those who offend. I have found that most offenders adamantly  
refuse to acknowledge their ignorance or to make any effort to  
improve their poor conduct whether it be in simple speech or in  
written dialogue. Witness the overworked use of &quot;Like&quot; and &quot;I went&quot;  
in conversations today when it is intended to mean &quot;as though&quot; and &quot;I  
said&quot;.

I find it difficult to accept ignorance combined with apathy from any  
source. I can accept ignorance for an excuse, but I also expect that  
it would be corrected in a timely manner through education and effort.

If I had presented my statements in the forms that are commonly being  
used today, I would have been chastised and prevented from moving up  
to the next grade in school.

!!!!!End of rant, many thanks for this opportunity to vent.!!!!!
</PRE>
