<PRE>I was working on a model car and a screw got inside my Kensington  
Keyboard-in-a-box.  I disassembled it and took out the screw but then  
the space bar wasn't working right.  When I hit any part of the space  
bar aside from the center it wouldn't produce a space.  I called  
Kensington and spoke to someone  quickly.  I told them that I  
disassembled it and just wanted to know if there were screws under  
the extreme right and left sides of the spacebar that may have gotten  
out.  I was hoping for a technical manual or something, but the rep I  
spoke to said they would just replace it, EVEN AFTER I TOLD THEM THAT  
I TOOK APART THE KEYBOARD TO REMOVE AN ITEM DROPPED INSIDE OF IT.  It  
is still under warranty too.  I asked the rep helping me, Siraj, if  
they wanted me to put the old one in the new box and ship it back to  
them,but he said i could just throw the old one away!  Unbelievable!   
So at least I'll have one for backup parts.

I know this doesn't relate to G4s but I had to tell all the Mac  
people here.  I told Siraj's supervisor about the excellent service  
he gave me so I'm sure it made his day.
