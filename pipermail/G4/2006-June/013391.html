<PRE>&lt;&lt; rich - i have the same machine and had the same dilemma - the folks at 

OWc said the main difference between the units was that the 111 would 

burn dual layer DVD's - if I had no real need for that, they felt the 

110 was actually a superior unit though a model older. I went with their 

recommendation, installed the 110 and it has worked flawlessly since 

putting it in.

hope that helps.

That was interesting since the following is the e-mail response from OWC on 
June 8th. I had the same question.

&lt;&lt;Hi,

This is Zach from the OWC Tech Support Dept.  

The difference in the two drives is that the 111d has a different firmware 
and at least 1 more option for burning the discs. 

I usually suggest the dvr 111d .

I believe from other research I did, that the 111D will burn to DVD-RAM and 
the 110D will not, but I could be wrong. I ended up buying 2 from NewEgg. com 
for $29 each plus change and shipping. They are now installed in both my QS and 
MDD, and they were both recognized in OS9 and OSX. I'm pretty sure I'll have 
to run Patchburn on both to use all the features without using Toast, but once 
again I could be wrong.
