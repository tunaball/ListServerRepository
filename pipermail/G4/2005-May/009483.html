<PRE>I also like retrospect. I have been using it for a long time since the 
mac os 8 days. It is a very good program. Never lost any data from it. 
I Agree that it is a little slow on scanning through 300,000 files, but 
it is faster than doing a manual restore... Also I think that they are 
on a better track now with EMC squared running the show. Free updates 
are good.  The reason I think that Dantz is  slow is because the 
application might not be a native os 10 cocoa application. I think it 
is  carbon based. It use to really fly in os 9, but that with much less 
files (10,000). So i don't know if it is the large number of files with 
os 10 or just the software itself that is making it  slow...
