<PRE>Better than OpenOffice is NeoOffice/J.  It has *all* of the
apps that &quot;M$ Office&quot; has, opens .doc, .xls, and .ppt files (with
what one would expect w.r.t. font-issues and the definitions
of &quot;Default&quot; styles from the sender's machine to your machine,
of course).  It also has a very good outside-of-PowerPoint
drawing tool.

You can get it, for free since it is in the same Open Software
family as OpenOffice, from:

    <A HREF="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/download.php">http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/download.php</A>

You do *not* have to install an X11 windows system for it because
it is implemented in Java.  But it is based on OpenOffice code
so gets the benefit of all the developers/maintainers of that
project (all the way back to Sun's StarOffice) as well as a
very dedicated group of Mac OS-X Macintosh-tailored version
maintainers.

Note there is a change in the Java support by Mac OS X between
Panther and Tiger, so some Java-based software may have
some problems.  The NeoOffice/J maintainers have already
diagnosed the issues -- see the forum thread at:

    <A HREF="http://trinity.neooffice.org/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=1329">http://trinity.neooffice.org/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=1329</A>

for the fixes that allow you to run NeoOffice/J as well as
any old or new Java code in Tiger.

I've been using this set of Office-replacement tools for a while
and I find them more capable than what I had used in AppleWorks.
You'll probably want to &quot;export&quot; important files out of AppleWorks
into their equivalent MS Office versions so that they can be read
by NeoOffice/J.  Unfortunately, it doesn't read AppleWorks file
formats since those have been fairly private to Apple (i.e., not
sufficiently, publically, documented).

 &gt;
 &gt; I read in Macworld that Appleworks is going bye bye.
 &gt;
 &gt; Sort of a problem for me because I need it for budget and for when
 &gt; Windows users send me Word docs. That's sort of all.
 &gt;
 &gt; I also notice that Maclink seems to not work at present. ???
 &gt;
 &gt; What are you all doing about Appleworks? I could just keep on using it
 &gt; forever except if new versions of Word don't open, I am sunk.
 &gt;
 &gt; Not interested in buying MS product right now, humph. Don't really use.
 &gt; Would buy Quicken for the budget. (Although I like the simplicity of
 &gt; the spreadsheet.)

 &gt; Add X11 to your system and use OpenOffice!
