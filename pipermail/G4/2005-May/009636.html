<PRE>HI Alex,

Thanks very much for the link and letting me in on the &quot;Panther + 
Firewire = Trouble&quot; situation (I am reading into it right now). Sure 
enough, my drive was totally reliable under OS 9 and now it's been 
hosed the way the article suggests. I'm pretty horrified that my device 
has been turned into a death trap for my data.

I bought my drive from PowerMax and they aren't listed under the group 
of mfr's who are providing firmware updates, but I will check their 
website and/or write them an email to see if they publish the firmware 
upgrade. I really hope I don't have to disconnect the drive and not use 
it anymore. It's only a couple years old.

Details about my upgrade, fyi:

I disconnected ALL my peripherals from my AGP G4 when I upgraded to OS 
X; I read a few articles on upgrading and one of them stressed doing 
this. I only reconnected the external HD after I was sure that the new 
OS was running alright (or so I presumed), and hoped for the best. At 
first, it looked OK and then I began to see the &quot;Stepford Wife&quot;-like 
replacement icons for my files (just black boxes), and noticing they 
had zero K...

Also, I upgraded using v. 10.3.5 discs supplied with the purchase of 
Panther I mad some months back; Apple was running a special deal: 
purchase both Panther + iLife '04 and receive a rebate. The first thing 
I did, incidentally, after upgrading to X was let the computer check 
for new software, which is how I am now at v. 10.3.9.

Again, thanks so much for your help.
Anthony
