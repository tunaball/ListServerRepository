<PRE>I agree that Retrospect is probably the backup software of choice  
right now. The speed of backup in Retrospect is directly related to  
the number of files. It has nothing to do with Carbon/Cocoa. Since  
Mac programs have done away with resource forks and now store all  
that data in application bundles, plus the fact that Unix uses tiny  
text files for every sort of configuration, a given installation of  
Mac OS X has about three to five times the number of files that an  
equivalent OS 9 installation would have had. Thus it takes longer to  
scan and copy in Retrospect.
&lt;rant&gt;OTOH, I'm not sure that I agree that the purchase of Dantz by  
EMC2 was such a good thing. Development of Retrospect Mac has not  
progressed in a couple of years. Retrospect for Windows has more  
functionality and is two major revs ahead of the Mac version with no  
apparent plans to bring them to parity. I had to pay to upgrade to  
get OS X compatibility without a single new feature. In fact, it has  
not changed materially in about three years except for doing away  
with Express, so everyone has to pay $50 to $100 more to do what you  
did before. Telephone tech support that used to be free is now non- 
existent. If you want tech support you have to buy a maintenance plan  
that is in no way economical for a home network. I have used  
Retrospect and its successors for ten years now, and it has saved my  
system several times, but I'm hoping someone Mac centric comes along  
to displace them. Impression looks like it could get there, but it's  
not yet. The company that makes Impression was very responsive to my  
questions before I even bought the software and has a development  
roadmap that is active. Competition is a good thing, and the Mac  
backup market has not had any for a very long time.
&lt;/rant&gt;
