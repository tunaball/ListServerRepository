<PRE>I'd vote for that.  I have noticed that since I replaced the original Radeon 7500 with an ATI 9000 in my Quicksilver 2002, a 2-1/2&quot; drive in an external USB 2.0 enclosure (I had previously installed both USB 2.0 and FW PCI cards, each with externals attached) would only work if I hooked it to an external power supply.  Previously, the USB port supplied sufficient power for it to work without an external power supply. 

Also, I had both a PC and my Mac as well as printer, router, cable modem, yadda, yadda, yadda, on my UPS, and all of a sudden the UPS started beeping (overload) when either the PC or the Mac started doing power-intensive things like reading a DVD--upgrading to Tiger was a real beeper.  I had also added a new OWC Mercury 1.4 GHz processor card, but the CPU in it should be drawing even less power than the original 800 MHz chip, so perhaps that was not a factor.  I bought another UPS and put the PC on one and the Mac on another, and there is peace again in Happy Valley. 

I didn't mean to add all that extraneous stuff, but for the first time ever I have observed real power draining in my 'puters.  And, that's why I would agree that the power limitations could be responsible for what you are experiencing.
