&gt;<i>David Pogue's &quot;Mac OS X: The Missing Manual&quot; is an excellent introduction. The Ray brothers' &quot;Mac OS X Unleashed&quot; is the next step up, and especially useful if you want to delve into the Unix guts of the OS. You can pick up the Panther editions of both titles at discount prices (the Tiger editions aren't out yet). Until you get, read, mark, and inwardly digest the books, Apple (naturally) provides some basics especially for you
