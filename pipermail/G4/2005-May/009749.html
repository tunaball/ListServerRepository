<PRE>Just diving in here to ask a couple questions:

A DVD burner for only $52 sounds almost too good to be true; I'm used 
to perusing mailers and seeing them listed for nearly a couple hundred 
bucks (although, these are usually external burners with Firewire 
options; the cheapest model I've seen for in the tower itself was 
$129).

I went to the site referred to below and looked at the item. Before I 
go further, let me just say that I am not well versed with the inner 
workings of my Mac (but I am willing to learn!), so please bear with 
me, here as I am bound to ask some foolish or at least obvious 
questions...

First, I presume I would be changing-out my existing DVD-ROM in my G4 
tower with this component, yes? What do you recommend I do with the old 
DVD-ROM? Is there a website which would enable me to &quot;recycle&quot; it by 
selling it to someone who needs one, even for a few bux? Or should I 
hang on to it &quot;just in case&quot; I need to reinstall it at a later date (if 
the DVD burner goes kaput)?

Second, would any additional hardware be needed to complete the change 
out of drives or would I just need to buy the burner itself?

Third, is this something I could do myself with some basic tools? I.e., 
Are installation instructions provided with such components usually 
sufficient to enable laypeople in accomplishing the removal of an older 
drive and installing a new one? I did install a new hard drive in my 
Mac once, but had to be coached in doing so over the phone, and admit I 
probably came off a bit like Karen Black in AIRPORT '75 during the 
experience. It certainly demystified the sacred box Apple led users 
like me to believe, for years, opening was a big &quot;no no&quot;...however I am 
hardly what you would call &quot;familiar&quot; with the inner workings of my 
Mac.

But, like I said, I *am* willing to learn...

Thanks very much for the advice.

Anthony
