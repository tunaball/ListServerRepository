<PRE>One of my favorite vendors is newegg.com.  They sell both enclosures and drives.  It is very easy to install a drive in an enclosure.  Yet another great choice is OtherWorldComputing, on the web as macsales.com.  They have an enclosure with a footprint just like the MacMini, called the miniStack.  I have the older version of that. I just bought the enclosure and installed my own HD that I had bought at newegg.com.   Look at <A HREF="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/firewire/">http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/firewire/</A>  and, also, <A HREF="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/ministack/">http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/ministack/.</A>  You can also buy HDs on that site, but they are generally more expensive than at newegg.com. 

The price of the drive will depend on its capacity.  So, expect to pay anywhere from about $60 to $100 for the drive and anywhere from about $30 to $70 for a firewire enclosure, depending on the other features (such as in the miniStack with USB 2.0 as well as FW and extra USB and FW ports).

&gt;<i>My question to you all is - if I buy the enclosure &quot;thing&quot;... (I found some on some respected Mac websites, am thinking about one made by &quot;MacAlly&quot;) - where do I then purchase the actual hard drive to go inside the thing? How much would I expect to pay for the actual drive? The website says that the MacAlly enclosure &quot;Supports any capacity 3.5&quot; ATA (IDE) Hard Drive&quot;... but I have no idea where to go buy such a thing.
