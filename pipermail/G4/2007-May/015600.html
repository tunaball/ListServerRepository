I think that the main problem you are having is that the PCI SATA  
card is not being recognized early enough during the bootup process  
for the card controller software to be activated. This causes your  
Mac to try to boot to the first available AND active system folder  
that it can find and that is the installer disk.

To avoid having the installer disk as the bootup device, you should  
hold down the mouse button to eject the disk during bootup. When it  
is not available any longer, the Mac will be forced to look elsewhere  
for an active system folder. You may find that the Mac won't  
recognize the installed system folder on the SATA drive for quite a  
while, so you should be patient and wait for more developments as it  
boots. I cannot tell you that the SATA drive will be recognized or  
not because I have no experience with your type of configuration  
(SATA card installed in older Mac).

To overcome this case of &quot;not yet active status&quot; for the card, you  
will have to get directions from someone who has more knowledge than  
I have. I hope that this advice will give you some help in  
understanding one part of the problem of adding cards and drives to  
machines that were not designed with those additions in mind.
