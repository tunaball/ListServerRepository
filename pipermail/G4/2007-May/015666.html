<PRE>Greetings ( + )!( + )

Margaret, since you have three (3) drives, I would try just 
disconnecting the first two (2) drive and try starting up. If that 
don't work then you can power-down and reconnect the disconnected 
drives.

As to the reinstalling, I tried that about 3 times and it never worked. 
If fact it got to a point where the system wouldn't even recognize the 
CD/DVD drive so I couldn't even read from the original install disk.
