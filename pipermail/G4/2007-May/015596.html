<PRE>Ask him what he will be using it for.  Keep in mind that when the  
machine came out (or any Mac for that matter) there were a lot of  
high-end applications for it.  Now those are blown away by newer  
software packages, but it doesn't make them unusable.  I gave an old  
Mac 7300 G3/400 upgraded to a buddy of mine and he's learning  
Photoshop.  Not only that but it's still easy to get on to a DSL line  
as well and browse the 'net.  I myself am getting a bit spoiled  
thinking of a Dual Core Intel Mac Mini, but then again, do I need  
it?  All the stuff I have now works fine.  Aside from not being able  
to play some of the newer games, there's still a lot that I can play  
including all the games from MAME, the Atari games, Intellivision  
Lives, Call of Duty, the Carmageddon series, Unreal Tournament 2004,  
the Quake series... and I'm happy.  The only reason I'd want a Mac  
Mini is so that I can run Windows and Mac at the same time, and I  
really want Windows just for the games including Visual Pinball  
(which allows you to play the old original pinball games on your PC).

Even if I were to have the old G3 back, I'd still be playing games on  
it and using Photoshop.  I could put it in an empty arcade cabinet  
and make a little home arcade with it (if I had the know-how and  
such).  Even if your son wants to program he could get started on  
that with the older G3.  If he gets a newer model he can keep the old  
one around and test any programs on that as well.  If he likes the  
design and wants to get into case modification, he can hack it and  
try getting a newer board into an older style case like the G3.  It  
all depends on what he will be using it for.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My son wants me to turn his Beige G3/333 into a FrankenMac like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> his sisters.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I can use a Sonnet G3/500 ZIF with 1MB cache processor OR an Apple
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> PowerMac G4/400 ZIF with 1MB cache and over clock it to 500Mhz.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thoughts, suggestions and warnings appreciated!
