<PRE>
Dual PowerPC G4 7447A CPUs running at 1.6 or 1.8 GHz are the only MDD  
upgrades that I know of.

I upgraded my MDD 1.25 GHZ G4 with the dual 1.8 GHz which, as far as  
performance is concerned, ran quite well. The big problem with that  
upgrade is the heat generated by the 7447 chips. It was just too much  
to bear. I had memory problems with the chips nearest the heat sink.  
The temperatures reported were quite high - a good 50 - 60 degrees F  
higher than the single 1.25 GHz Stock Mac CPU. The upgrade's heat  
sink was too hot to touch. The heat sink on the stock 1.25 MDD is  
barely warm by comparison. I returned that upgrade because of the  
temperature problems.

Newer Technology has announced new G4 upgrades using the 7448 CPU  
which is said to run much cooler. They do not currently have this for  
the MDD, however. I have e-mailed Newer Technology showing my  
interest in a 7448 upgrade for the MDD G4 but have not heard from  
them. You might try contacting them.

Good luck and please post your experience if you upgrade.

Best regards - Bob S
