<PRE>Greetings ( + )!( + )

Margaret I had the same problem for different reasons and the only way 
that I found to get out of it was to swap the disk locations.

If you have a G4 Sawtooth I'll guess that you just upgraded to 10.4.6 
on your secondary disk, that's the one that is located on top.

Don't ask why but the systems wants to boot to that disk. You don't 
actually have to move the disk, just disconnect the ribbon cable from 
both disks and place the second connector on the top disk. The second 
connector is for the primary disk. Then boot-up and it should come 
on-line.

Hopefully you can then shut down and reconnect the disks back like 
normal and everything will work. If not then just swap the disk 
locations.

Worked for me.
