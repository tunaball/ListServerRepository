<PRE>This might be off track but wasn't there a firmware upgrade that had  
to be performed with one of OS X versions? I tried looking though  
Apple's website but got lost in all the updates. I don't remember if  
the firmware update was for 10.2 or 10.3.

Maybe that is all you need. Maybe some one else remembers which  
version needed the firmware upgrade.
