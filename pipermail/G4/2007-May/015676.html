<PRE>Greetings ( + )!( + )

Margaret, perhaps I wasn't clear, I think that once you get the 
platform to boot into your disk with the 10.4.x you can then reconnect 
the other drives and everything will work Okay.

You shouldn't need to connect and disconnect the drives with 9.2. and 
10.2.8 every time you want to use those drives.

However with my system when I want to switch to 9.2.2 I have to 
start-up for the 9.2 CD before I can switch to the 9.2.2 which on a 
partition on my second drive.

Just remember that I'm not guaranteeing that disconnecting your 1st two 
drive will cure your problem, as every problem with a Mac platform can 
be unique. I'm just suggesting that you give it a try and see.
