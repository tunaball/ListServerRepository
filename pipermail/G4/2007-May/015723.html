Hello, Michelle

You seem to be thinking in terms of adding storage only through an external
hard drive.  

You should understand that there is a huge performance penalty for going
this route as opposed to adding another internal hard drive to your Mac.  In
tests I conducted using my Blue &amp; White, a drive in an external FW/USB case
ran only 2% (USB 1.1) to 30% (USB 2.0) to 42% (FW400) as fast as the same
drive mounted internally.  Since OS X is so disk-intensive, this will
strongly affect your user experience.

Consider also that your current internal hard disk is probably 7 years old.
Hard disks do wear out. The best come with only 5 year warranties, and the
garden variety only 3 years. It would be prudent to purchase a bare hard
drive from a place such as OWC (<A HREF="http://eshop.macsales.com/MyOWC/">http://eshop.macsales.com/MyOWC/</A>) as a
replacement for your original drive, and use it as your boot disk.  The
original drive (assuming it is worth keeping) can be placed in an external
enclosure and used as a backup, and will last a whole lot longer in an
external case which is powered up only once a month.

Some gotchas to consider:
*The caveat in your case is that the Sawtooth can only use a maximum of 128
GB of drive space, so you are limited in how large a drive you can buy.
(There are ways around this limit, but they involve hacks which can cause
you Big Trouble down the line.)
*USB 2.0, unless you are willing to spring for a hardware upgrade (an add-in
PCI card), is not available to you.
* While you can boot from an external FW drive, a Sawtooth cannot boot off
USB.
* Depending on your budget, and on how long you intend to use this Mac,
consider purchasing a separate SATA PCI card and SATA (instead of the
natively supported (P)ATA) hard drive.   The drives cost the same, but the
card will add $50+ to your purchase cost.  Your disk access will jump,
according to my own tests, an additional 10% to 50%, and you can use, and
boot off, any size HD you want.
