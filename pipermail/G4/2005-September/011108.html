All,

I am wondering the same as I would like to increase my HD size and 
system
speed at the same time.  Has anyone tried this already and would you 
please
share the results with us?  Thank you.

I have never tried to connect the motherboard IDE controller to a PCI 
card IDE controller, but it seems to me that it would be a terrible 
mistake to attempt such a move. When I installed my Sonnet IDE 
controller card, there was no information about making a connection 
from the MoBo to the card except for the PCI socket circuitry. The 
extra drives were connected to the controller card sockets by the new 
ribbons and that gave me an additional two functional hard drives in 
the case of my G4 Gbit.

If someone else can give an exact reason, other than my fear of trying 
to run two controllers (the MoBo one AND the card one) through the same 
circuit on the PCI card, it would certainly advance my Mac knowledge.

As far as increasing the speed of performance, I would suggest that any 
increase would be the result of the hard drive connected to the PCI 
card instead of the MoBo socket. If you installed a faster drive unit, 
that might add to the performance because of a shorter seek/recover 
time. But, all in all, I have found that the computer can never match 
the speed of my brain because it has to wait until I physically tell it 
what to do.

If only the machine could interface directly with the brain????? Shades 
of Cyborg!!!
