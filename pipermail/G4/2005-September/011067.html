<PRE>What you describe has nothing to do with viruses. First thing you  
could do is stop using the MS mail client witch is the number one  
target for every jerk in the world. Macro Virus protection in Office  
is misspeak at best. Hotmail??? you have all of uncle Bill's bad boys.

The rise in email problems you describe is in proportion to the  
doubling of malware on the net in the time frame you mention.  
&quot;Entourage and that is where I get the spoofs&quot; Some body has that  
ISP's number and it is being called through Entourage.&quot; When you run  
with scissors you are going to get hurt&quot; I would dump MS and the ISP.

</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> come mails that appear to be from my ISP and with subjects like  
</I>&gt;<i> 'Warning:
</I>&gt;<i> Account About To Be Cancelled' They all have attachments which I  
</I>&gt;<i> don't open
</I>&gt;<i> and my ISP says they are not genuine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At first I thought it was an outside party, possibly someone who

</I>&gt;<i> blacklisted
</I>&gt;<i> for spam, I suspect it is in my computer. While I have no AV I do  
</I>&gt;<i> have Macro
</I>&gt;<i> Virus Protection enabled in MS Office. Additionally I use Hotmail,  
</I>&gt;<i> Mail and
</I>&gt;<i> Entourage. I have my 3 main email addresses separate, one on  
</I>&gt;<i> Hotmail, one on
</I>&gt;<i> Entourage, one on Mail. Hotmail seems not to be affected, but 2  
</I>&gt;<i> separate
</I>&gt;<i> email addresses, one from my ISP, the other from one of my websites  
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> hosted away from the ISP with another company are equally affected  
</I>&gt;<i> with each
</I>&gt;<i> getting spoof mail from the server connected to that email address.  
</I>&gt;<i> That is
</I>&gt;<i> the mail that comes from my website email adress is on Mail only  
</I>&gt;<i> while the
</I>&gt;<i> email address from my ISP is on Entourage and that is where I get  
</I>&gt;<i> the spoofs
</I>&gt;<i> that claim to be from my ISP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone any experience in what precisely I am looking for and how to
