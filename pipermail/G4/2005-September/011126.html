A refrigerator and a freezer more than likely won't cause a voltage 
serge on the circuit that they are connected to, but they can cause the 
voltage to drop below a safe operating level during the start-up 
period.

What you need is a Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) that has a 
low-voltage detector. Most of the inexpensive ones only detect a 
complete loss of power and you need one that comes into play upon low 
levels, like when the refrigerator or freezer are in the start-up 
cycle.

There are also constant voltage transformers that put out a constant 
voltage when the input voltage goes up and down, however they are 
pretty expensive.

Most surge protectors are for protection against Lightning.
