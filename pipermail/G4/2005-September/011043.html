In other words, you can't really fix it, so find a way to live with 
it...

Thanks for the explanation!


Not totally correct interpretation. (Capital letters inserted below for 
emphasis, not volume.)

What is happening is that information is being downloaded to your 
machine at a speed SLOWER than your machine can display it on screen. 
If you try to display it WHILE it is downloading, you will be trying to 
display an incomplete file and will not be able to display the part 
that has NOT YET COMPLETED the download process.

If you wait until the entire file has completed the download process 
and THEN open it for display, you should be able to see the file in its 
entirety without stuttering or pauses.

This is a case of the machine not being able to keep up with the speed 
of a human brain. We all want it RIGHT NOW, don't we? Until computers 
can act as fast as the human brain, and maybe even be self-cognizant, 
we have to accept the slowness of data transfer and display from 
location to location.
