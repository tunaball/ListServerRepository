What the trusted friend meant when he said that &quot;memory tests
are not reliable&quot; is the following:

   passing the test does NOT reliably guarantee that the memory is OK.

Finding a &quot;stuck&quot; bit is easy; all test programs go through setting
every bit and checking that it sets, and clearing every bit and checking
that it got cleared.

Unfortunately, it is possible for bits to be temperature sensitive - so
that they work perfectly until the chip has reached a higher temperature
at which point they become unreliable.  That means that running the test
soon after startup may not spot problems which might be caught after the
machine has been running hard for hours on a hot day...

The big problem is that memory chips can be &quot;pattern sensitive&quot;, meaning
that a failure can depend on a specific pattern of reads and writes to
*nearby* bits.  There are simply too many possible patterns to fully
test each one - it would take decades.

Sometimes one test program will find no problem while another one will -
because they use slightly different patterns.  Sometimes neither test
program will find any problem, but a certain program will misbehave -
again because the program &quot;found&quot; the right pattern to trigger the error.

Conclusion:
  if *any* memory test finds a problem you DO have BAD memory
  if no memory test finds a problem you MAY have good memory


Also, bear in mind that problems with the motherboard and/or power
supplies can cause memory to malfunction.  It seems you did the
right tests to check by moving around the memory sticks - if the
failures moved with the sticks then you can be confident that
the problem lies in the stick rather than in the slot. And if
some sticks are always OK then that suggests the motherboard and
supplies should be OK...
