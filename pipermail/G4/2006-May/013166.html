Hmm...  Maybe I should let Sonnet know I'm window-shopping for processor 
upgrades for my Gigabit Ethernet.

I received my G4 with a dead processor and a spare 400 (or is it 450) 
MHz processor pulled from a Cube.  I'd like to get a dual-processor 
upgrade for it - any suggestions?

I also want to upgrade the video card.  I have a Radeon 9800 Pro in my 
PC that I've been very happy with, but I haven't found a clear answer 
whether or not the 9800 Pro Mac Edition will work in my Gigabit.  Does 
anyone know?  What other video cards should I consider?

The power supply rating seems pretty wimpy after my experience with PC 
power supplies.  Are there any upgrades available in this department?

What stores would you guys recommend for Mac parts and upgrades?

Finally, does anyone have a u-shaped hard drive bracket that will fit my 
Gigabit?  I'd be willing to pay $10...maybe $15 including shipping.

I know I'm looking at spending more on this old G4 than a Mac Mini would 
cost, but I don't want to buy another computer (silly me)!

I'm glad I found you guys!
