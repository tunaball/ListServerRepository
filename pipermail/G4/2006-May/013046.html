<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jamie and JR have done a great job of dealing with the practicals but 
</I>&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;<i> are a couple of issues to consider.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly there is a large difference between OS 9 on a separate 
</I>&gt;<i> partition and
</I>&gt;<i> OS 9 in Classic. It has been my experience that OS 9 programs running 
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> classic can have printer difficulties etc. It seems to me that this is
</I>&gt;<i> because OS 9 has troubles figuring out what OS X is trying to do. I 
</I>&gt;<i> think
</I>&gt;<i> having OS 9 on a separate partition works better as you can set things 
</I>&gt;<i> up so
</I>&gt;<i> that poor old '9' can feel more at home and can organise stuff to suit
</I>&gt;<i> itself. And you will still have 'Classic' for those times when you 
</I>&gt;<i> have a
</I>&gt;<i> need for just a couple of minutes in '9' land.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After all 'Classic' was only ever intended as a way of getting those 
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> lots of OS 9 programs to make the leap to OS X, it was never meant as a
</I>&gt;<i> permanent solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And of course what has happened is that most of us with OS 9 
</I>&gt;<i> partitions now
</I>&gt;<i> hardly ever use them for '9'. In my case I use it to store my iTunes
</I>&gt;<i> library, it is just the right size. And OS X has no troubles looking 
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i> '9' land, it is only '9' that has trouble looking into '10'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can set up a 'drop box', a folder that is common to both 
</I>&gt;<i> partitions and
</I>&gt;<i> appears on both desktops for passing files from one side to the other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now about OS X. You  DO need OS 10.3.9 as a minimum as virtually all 
</I>&gt;<i> current
</I>&gt;<i> software out there is now like Firefox etc is requiring that. You need 
</I>&gt;<i> discs
</I>&gt;<i> anyway so look for a more recent version. And 10.3.9 is excellent. The 
</I>&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;<i> thing worth shouting about in Tiger is spotlight. So same price I would
</I>&gt;<i> choose Tiger, but if I could find a cheaper Panther disc I would go 
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> that if it was 3.9 but any earlier version is not worth the trouble.
</I>
Hello Kenn,

Glad to know you made such a desicion!! I agree with Tony and tell you 
what I'd do if I were you. First, get the install discs for Panther. It 
doesn't matter what the version is as you can update it to 10.3.9 over 
the internet with no problem. Just that simple.

Second, I'd seriously consider buying a new, faster and larger disk to 
run OSX. You won't believe what a faster machine you'll have just doing 
that. Then, I would leave OS9 running on the older one. This way you 
won't have to partition anything as widely recomended for OSX ;-)

I hope I was helpful.

Good luck.

Jose. Santa Fe, Argentina.
