I can recommend the Adesso ergonomic keyboards. They have 2 models, the
Nu-Form and the Tru-Form. IIRC, the Tru-Form is available in USB, while the
Nu-Form is only available in ADB. I'm using a Nu-Form with a Griffin iMate
adapter and it works fine.
I really like the split keyboard layout, with the two halves angled slightly
inwards, which seems to be a much more natural position for your hands and
wrists. The keyboard has a nice wrist pad that is also designed to let your
fingers fall more naturally onto the keys - and I use the word &quot;fall&quot;
specifically, in that, as opposed to the widespread practice of using
built-in legs to tilt the keyboard UP from the back to front, it seems much
more natural to have your hands fall downwards from front to back. I just
don't think it's very natural, or comfortable, to bend your wrists upwards
when you want to type, so I find the Adesso keyboard very comfortable, very
natural, very ergonomic. I often have to type for 8 hours a day and I have
found that the Adesso keyboard makes a difference in avoiding pain and
stiffness. I've been using it for about 3 years now.

My particular setup is less than ideal, in that the Griffin adapter has to
be plugged directly into the computer and, as the keyboard has 2 ADB ports,
I have to plug the mouse into a USB hub (which seems to cause a glitch about
once a month or so). I also have to unplug the Griffin and keyboard before I
can shut down (if I try to shut down, the computer reboots). I have been
looking for a cheap USB Adesso, but I'm in Europe and shipping on keyboards
from the US is ridiculously expensive. Will try to find one on ebay, I
guess. 

Good luck.

Chris
