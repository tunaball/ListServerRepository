<PRE>Sean, I don't find it odd. This is a school with curious kids. They try
stuff, you know. It's easy to plug a cheap FW cable in backwards. This can
fry a FW bus very quickly, and only the more recent G4s have a self-healing
FW bus. So it is no surprise if the FW busses on several computers are
fried.

Diannah, this is a great opportunity to teach the kids why it's important to
plug the FW cable in the right way.

Did the controller show up? or just not the devices you plugged into it? 
IE when you are in the Apple System Profiler does it say: FireWire
Information -&gt; Device not found 

Or does it say 
FireWire Information -&gt; FireWire (built-in) 

and just not list any devices. 

I guess it really makes me wonder since I assume you are using the same 
devices, and are reporting two dead machines with bad FW ports if there 
really isn't something else going on. Like a bad cable, crosstalk, a 
device is drawing too much power, flaky chipset, corrosion, etc. etc. 

I know I have a really early ADS Pyro case that won't work with the G4 
although it works fine with the 8500 and the firewire card. I was 
supposed to send that in on a recall but forgot to do it. It was actually 
really flaky for a long time with detection before I got it working. 

I am NOT saying you are wrong. I just think it is odd. And if the ports 
are in fact dead I would seriously be leary that something that is shared 
between the machines is actually causing maybe a power surge or whatever.
