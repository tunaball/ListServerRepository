<PRE>The one to get is dual 1.25 GHz w/2MB L3 cache, 256MB RAM, 80 GB HD, 
Combo Drive for $1599 at Apple Store.com. Last week they had it posted 
as a model for sale. This week they only offer it as a build to order 
up from the single 1.25 GHz w/1 MB L3 cache $1299 model in the 
customize section for plus $300. Just select the processor pop up to 
see the dual 1.25 GHz option has 2MB L3 cache per processor.

This is UNLIKE this Winter-Spring 2003 model which only has 1MB L3 
cache per processor BUT which as FW 800 and Airport Extreme and cannot 
boot OS 9.

The &quot;new&quot; one is based on last year's motherboard that can boot OS 9 
natively and does NOT have Airport Extreme and FW 800. So the trade-off 
is if those new technologies are important to you vs. the higher 
performing dual 1.25 w/2MB L3 cache.

I can't find any mail order houses that have this &quot;new&quot; model/price. 
Only Small Dig had 19 on order last Tuesday (morning after SteveNote) 
that they only sold to prior customers in a few hours (including me).

This configuration was featured on the Apple Site as well. But not for 
long. At first they were only offering two models. Both stripped with 
one 1.25 GHz w/1MB L3 cache or two 1.25 GHz w/2MB L3 cache processors. 
And I don't know how long they kept it setup like that. But now you 
have to dig to figure out how to get it that way.

I think Apple was taken aback by the instant hit they had on their 
hands and still offers it but in a more difficult way to figure out in 
order to lower demand.

Now they feature a loaded single 1.25 w/1MB L3 cache for $1949. If you 
have all the add on parts like I do, plenty of HDs, SuperDrive, it's 
cheaper to buy the stripped model and beef it up yourself. I can get 
three 512 MB 2700 DDR ram strips for $201 and that's all I need to buy 
to fully trick it out to a 1.792 GB RAM system. Close enough for me to 
the max.

Is that short enough for you? ; ^ )
