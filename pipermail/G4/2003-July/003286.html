<PRE>I don't know Canadian conversion rate but I bought the NEW SUMMER 2003 
dual 1.25 w/2MB L3 cache that boots OS 9 last Tuesday for $1599 from 
Small Dog. That is also the Apple's Store.com price when you custom 
build from the single 1.25 w/1MB L3 cache for $1299 - only $300 US more 
for the above dual.

ALERT ALERT WARNING ALERT WARNING WARNING ALERT ALERT ALERT  WARNING

NOT 1GHz.

BOGUS DEALER OFFER         	BOGUS DEALER OFFER          BOGUS DEALER 
OFFER

1.25 GHz single w/1MB L3 cache $1299 US

OR

Dual 1.25 GHz w/2MB L3 cache on each processor $1599 US.

Do NOT let a dealer sell you one of their OLD non booting 9 1 GHz Macs 
from earlier this year with only 1MB L3 cache. Apple has reverted to 
last year's motherboard now only better than Feb-June 2003 for less 
money.

IMHO G5 will NOT be August. It will be September for those who ordered 
last Monday morning, October for others who ordered last week and 
November if you haven't ordered yet or just did this week. My opinion 
ONLY. Not Fact. Prediction. Guess. Wild imagination.

However, you might get around that long cue by camping out at an Apple 
Retail Store for a week. ; ^ )

Adobe promised in the WWDC SteveNote that the Photoshop 64-bit update 
will be delivered in August before the G5's are. The 64-bit updates are 
trivial for developers to recompile with Apple's new super fast 
re-compilers. So I wouldn't worry about much of a lag on that score. 
It's Panther that may be late in coming to the G5.
