<PRE>No the Windtunnel Effect is unique to the MDD at least from My  
experience.

For some people its more than annoyance and inventive ways were  
created to combat it. I remember one such person who eventually  
housed his MDD in a foam lined box to buffer all the noise as his  
machine was used in an Audio Recording studio.

For me I got used to it. So much in fact when I got a newer Mac, a  
Mac mini in late 2007 I thought many times that the darn thing wasn't  
even on cause the one tiny fan made barely any noise at all.

I still use my MDD for almost everything so its not going away. A  
power supply replacement courtesy of Apple Pro Care (in early 2007)  
cut down the noise somewhat.
And I swapped out the main 120mm Case/CPU fan near the same time for  
a lower RPM model. That small project was crazy as I thought every  
thing would of been similar, but some wires were different on the one  
I pulled form inside my MDD and had to have a buddy break out a  
Soldering Gun and redo a connection that I messed up.

When I've visited friends with their Dual G5's the generation of  
Tower Macs AFTER the MDD series, the Noise level on those are much  
much lower.

I know the BWG3 I used to  use before I got my MDD was never that  
loud. I assume Apple was trying new technology as the MDD was a  
relatively new idea for Apple in terms of Dual Processor Technology use.
