My first thought is to duplicate the network configuration of your DP  
on the new machine, putting the same addresses in if any, or leaving  
it on DHCP if that's what it's doing. With my own DSL modem and ISP,  
I have a static address from them to use on any computer or router  
that is directly connected to the modem, and I've switched it around  
many times actually without a hitch. As long as AT&amp;T isn't looking at  
MAC addresses, you should have no trouble either. If they do, I guess  
you'll have to grit your teeth and call them to have the new machine  
okayed with them.

Best of luck,

Eric W.
