<PRE>Thanks for the replies and help.
My QS has just arrived, via FedEx. (yay!)

Ok, I get that I can use both the 9.2.1 retail,
and my 10.4.6 retail disk to install on the QS,
wether I partition or not. Thanks for that info.
Now I put the 9.2.2 upgrade onto my external FW drive,
as well as the Tiger combo update, which I downloaded yesterday.
The external FW has 10.4.6 installed, so I could boot from it, and
finish the updates to the QS. (and yes, I will update the FW to  
10.4.11 too)

Now here's another question, it may be obvious,
to most but not to me, so I'll ask it.
I use DSL for my internet connection, it was set up
when I bought my DP450. Before I pull the plug on
that machine, I want to make sure that I know what
I need to do for my new QS. Do I just use the same
network settings as the 450? Would those work for the QS?
Do I need to notify my provider, which is ATT,
and I hate the idea of having to deal with any of
their tech help, who in the past have never been any
help to me. Since it's a different machine I'm assuming
a different machine ID may need to be input somewhere?
(I looked in MacHelp, but it still wasn't clear to me)
Or should I just plug my DSL modem into the QS, and
follow the setup assistant that I'm sure will pop up when
I install OS10.4.6? (Which, BTW, will ask me if I want to
register the software - I already did that on my 450, surely
I don't do it again - I am allowed to install the OS on another
computer, no? It asked me that when I installed OS10.4.6 on my external
FW drive, and I wasn't sure what to do; I also tried importing my
network settings from the the 450 to the FW and ran into problems
and ended up just quitting the assistant!!) So yes, I need advice
from a clearer head than mine, or I'll screw things up and not be
able to connect to the internet with either computer, and you'll never
hear from me again, which may be a blessing to you all...
