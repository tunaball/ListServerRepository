Hello O'Brien,

Sorry for the confusion, but the others seem to have grasped what I am talking about.  The situation is, I have acquired a non-booting, nothing showing on the screen G5, which I am trying to determine if it's truly dead. 

It does not have memory or a hard drive.  I'm not looking to set up the BIOS or anything.  I am indeed a windows user, but I also use an old G4 Dual 450.  Within the windoze world, as the machine starts up, you can press and 'F' key and go into it's internal set up without ever booting the OS. This would not only allow you to set boot preferences etc, but would be a general indicator of things such as whether power was actually going to the motherboard, whether or not it could see the hard drive(s), the graphics card was working, etc.  I was only wondering if there was an option to do the equivalent on a MAC.  This would prevent me from having to buy stuff for a potentially 'dead' machine.  So far, the fans spin up, there is a red led lit up on the edge of the motherboard, but that's all that happens.  No bong, no nothing.  There is power going to the DVD as I am able to push the button on the front of it and it opens, but if I try to open it via the keyboard it doesn't.  I hope that clears up the confusion.

But here's more. 

There are four slots for memory modules.  These slots are located beneath the double fan assembly and the banks are separated by quite a bit of space.  I have no way of telling which bank is which.  Each bank as two slots labelled 1 &amp; 2, and to places where it looks like further slots could be installed labelled 3 &amp; 4.  I have two 1 GB sticks of 184 pin DDR PC3200 memory.  If this will work in the Mac, how should I install it?  In the top or bottom bank?  One stick in slot 1 of each of the banks? One in slot 1 of one bank, and one in slot two of the other?  I've tried several combinations, but still nothing.

Sorry for all the questions.  Yes, I am still fairly new to Macs.
