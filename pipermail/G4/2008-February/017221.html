<PRE>NOTE:  PIN CONFIGURATION on power supplies

Someone else can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure the Yikes 
was based on the G3.  The G3 has the lower wattage power supply with a 
20 pin connector.  I know the Gigabit has a 22 pin connector, I have 2 
of them.  Be sure the PIN CONFIGURATION matches when you are looking at 
power supplies!

I went through this when I thought I needed a power supply for my 
Gigabit, 450Mhz single processor.  The machine wouldn't start up.  Push 
the power button and nothing would happen.  I tried unplugging it for 
various periods of time from a few minutes to a few hours and plugging 
it back in.  Nothing.  The diagnostic I found on the internet indicated 
that the power supply was dead.  I had trouble locating one at a 
reasonable price, so I ended up buying a used G4 Quicksilver Dual 1 
Ghz.  I took the pram battery out of the Gigabit and was just going to 
use it for parts.  A few weeks later - just on a whim - I tried to 
start it up.  Much to my surprise, it started and ran fine.  It's been 
going strong for almost a year since the original failure and I have no 
idea what the original trouble was!  Anyone ever of something like this 
and know what causes it?

&gt;<i> The Gigabit had a higher wattage power supply that was 328 watts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The yikes was around 200 watts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for physical size I am not sure.
