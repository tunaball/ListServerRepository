</I>&gt;<i> For whatever reasons, Apple has moved away from the mid-range desktop
</I>&gt;<i> product that they used to excel at. I finally stopped waiting for an
</I>&gt;<i> Intel system that would fill the functions of my PM G4 and built a
</I>&gt;<i> hackintosh. But having done that I wouldn't necessarily advise others
</I>&gt;<i> to go that route, especially if you want to use your system for real,
</I>&gt;<i> productive work. As a hobby project it's fine, but unless you're pretty
</I>&gt;<i> aware of what you're doing and prepared to deal with the vagaries of
</I>&gt;<i> boot loaders, kexts, and third-party drivers, as well as prepared to
</I>&gt;<i> have every OS X update be a potential adventure, you should be wary
</I>&gt;<i> of the hackintosh.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess this is a long-winded way of saying that the G4s and G5s may
</I>&gt;<i> still be the best alternatives for many tasks.

</I>Not sure I agree with your assessment of the Hackintosh option having 
built 11 of them so far, but it's clear they are not as easy to update 
and configure as an acutal Mac would be.  But consider the fact that I 
did the last few movies on my 1st Hack and it took less than half the 
time it took on my MDD, you would have to count this as a viable option 
if speed is important.  Of course the building and maintaining is fun 
for me, as you said it is a hobby, but I can see this would not be for 
everyone.  JMHO
