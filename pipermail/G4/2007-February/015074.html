<PRE>Carol,

    Your on a DSL line, so here is how you set things up as it differs from 
those who have cable modems.

1) You must have a network cable connected from you Mac to the Router
2) On your Mac, Click on you Applel logo in the upper left corner, and then
System Preferences.
    a) Click on Network
    b) Click on Built-in-Ethernet. This must have a green dot or your
connection to the router is not valid
    c) Click on Configure
    d) Select TCP/IP and for &quot;Configure IPv4&quot; you must select Using DHCP (do
not worry about IPv6, you are not going to use that version) If IP Address
does not show a number such as 192.168.1.xxx, click on Renew DHCP Lease. If
this fails then follow e,f,g below and retry this step again. If you can not
gain an IP address at this point, press the reset button on the back of your
router to return it to factory settings and try again this step again. This
step must pass or you will have no connection to your router. Your email
states that this has happened and is good. And yes, your router is suppling
the IP addy, Netmask and so on. You do not need to do this yourself.

    e) Select PPPoE and ensure there is no check mark for Connect using
PPPoE
    f) Select Ethernet and ensure &quot;Configure&quot; states Automatically
    g) click lower right corner &quot;Apply Now&quot;.

    Your computer is now set up to connect by LAN and not by DSL. You may
now connect to your router through any web brower by going to
<A HREF="http://192.168.1.111">http://192.168.1.111</A> Do so and log in to your router. If this step happens
and your into your router control screen you have done very well and
everything is moving along as should be.

What to do with the Router:

1) Access the Router web page (It is a web page served from the router)
<A HREF="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</A> user your browser, any browser, it does not matter as you
are connecting to a web server.
    a) Skip the Name field and enter the word &quot;admin&quot; (no &quot; marks please) in
the Password field
    b) You are now logged into your router and you can adust settings. It is
HERE that you will connect to you DSL. Understand this, your router talks to
the DSL, your computer talks to the router. You computer does not ever talk
to the DSL as if the router is not involved. Reading your email it is here
that you are having difficulties. The steps which follow will resolve your
problems
    c) For WAN Connection type select PPPoE. This is what a DSL line uses.
    d) Enter whatever user name you have for your DSL
    e) Enter whatever passowrd you have for you DSL. These are provided by
your ISP when you aquired the DSL service and are required
    f) Click on Apply

Your router will now connect to your DSL unit.
Your computer is already setup to connect to the router.

At this point you may use your computer to connect to the Internet. Since
you are using a Mac there is no reason to do restarts.

Let us know if this has helped or if you have other problems. Besure to
include details.

    The question about xinetd has been answered correctly. It is a port
monitoring daemon and so listens to your computer ports. When incoming
connection request are made this service will make that connection. Think of
it as the operator on a phone line. And incoming call comes to the operator
and a connection is requested. The operator (daemon) will make that
connection. You have no services for this daemon to connect to. GOOD!
