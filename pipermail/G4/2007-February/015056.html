</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Great. Now try to forget all that.
&gt;<i> My son gave me his old MMD dual 1.25 400 including lots of recently  
</I>&gt;<i> installed applications and 10.4.8. I backed up the whole drive with  
</I>&gt;<i> Retrospect Desktop, added a HD, and partitioned that as follows: 121

</I>&gt;<i> scratch, and 1gb for downloading, and 1gb for a redundant 9.2.2  
</I>&gt;<i> boot volume. Then I used Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the original  
</I>&gt;<i> HD into the 121 gig volume. All is working well.
</I>
Too many partitions.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can I now simple copy the applications folder from the 121gb volume  
</I>&gt;<i> into the applications volume, pull all the applications out of the  
</I>&gt;<i> folder, then trash that empty folder, and replace the applications  
</I>&gt;<i> folder on the 121gb with an alias pointing to the new 5gb  
</I>&gt;<i> applications volume?
</I>Have a backup drive or don't. Your choice. But you are taking simple  
and making it painful. This will bite you in the ass later, and you  
waste gigs on the partitioning.
&gt;<i> Are there invisible files that would be lost and not included in  
</I>&gt;<i> the process?
</I>usually
&gt;<i> Do application preference files under OSX get mingled in with the  
</I>&gt;<i> system folder/files as they do in OS9?
</I>Why don't you poke around in OSX . Prefs are in the library folders  
of which there at least two.
&gt;<i> Maybe I could use CCC to clone the folder. ????
</I>Sure. Or you could .....just install all your stuff on one big drive.  
Partition the other one like 100/20 put 0.2.2 on the 20 and CCC your  
main drive to the 100.
  Then both drives will have lots of space and the 100 will have  
clean space.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can I install 9.2.2 in the 121gb &quot;system&quot; volume now or will I have  
</I>&gt;<i> to uninstall OSX, install OS9, and then reinstall OSX so that I can  
</I>&gt;<i> run in classic mode?
</I>&gt;<i> I realize I can use the redundant 1gb 9.2.2 boot volume but mighten  
</I>&gt;<i> it be useful to have both options?
</I>
You can install enough 9.2 for classic from within OSX (system  
preferences) Your potential 9.2.2 boot drive will be a separate install.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of my old applications will only run under OS9. How can I get  
</I>&gt;<i> them from my networked B&amp;W, 7500, and IIfx and be sure all the  
</I>&gt;<i> parts are there?
</I>CD's but it isn't pretty. I'd bag it. Install them to your boot 9.2  
drive or partition.
being sure all the parts are there is a pain.

&gt;<i> Where do I put them?
</I>&gt;<i> Would it just be easier to reinstall them?
</I>That would be good if you have discs and serial#s but it's still old  
stuff. The new stuff is better.
&gt;<i> If so is that done in OS9, OSX, or does it matter?
</I>Of course it matters. OSX all the time. Some of your olld apps might  
run under classic. Some won't. USe X as much as possible.
