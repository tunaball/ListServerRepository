<PRE>Camino and SeaMonkey stem from the same Mozilla roots.  They are not 
all that difference.  I prefer the SeaMonkey interface to that of 
Camino, however.

I always have a duplicate copy of my Eudora Settings File handy in 
case I run into the same problem that you did.  Yesterday, however, 
my wife could not log into her ISP (Cox) mail account using Apple's 
Mail,  and I could not log into one of a few separate mail accounts 
that I have with Cox.net as well, and I use Eudora.  But, I could 
access my other mail accounts with no trouble.  Also, I could not 
access the problem e-mail accounts over Cox's web interface, though, 
again, I could access the other e-mail accounts that way, too.  So, 
the problem was at Cox's end and not with our e-mail clients.  Worth 
checking next time your mail wedges.

One more problem that I used to get at my employer's office about 
five years ago was not being able to download e-mail beyond a certain 
message.  I would have to log into the machine at the terminal level 
and use a UNIX editor to remove the offending message (I think the 
problem was an end-of-file error).  I have not had that problem with 
any of my commercial ISPs' e-mail accounts, however.

If you feel that you want to use another e-mail client, you might 
also take a look at a very good one called GyazMail.app ($18, 
shareware).  I tried it for a while and liked it very much, but since 
I had years and years of history and addresses stored on Eudora, I 
decided to stay with Eudora.
