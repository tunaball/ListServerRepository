<PRE>Hi, I'm new to the list and new to Macs, although I'm a qualified PC 
technician.

I've just been given what I believe is a G4 PowerMac, a later G4/400 
Sawtooth I think as reading through the specs it doesn't appear to have an 
internal firewire port.  The only one which doesn't.

At the moment it will boot up, but then I get a flashing question mark on 
the screen which I know means it can't find the system folder.  I have no 
backup discs.  Is there any way I can find out if the drive is not being 
recognised for some reason or has been wiped, short of slaving it to another 
computer to have a look?  All the cables appear to be connected OK inside.

I don't believe there is a CMOS Setup Program in the BIOS as PCs have, but I 
have seen a hardware diagnostic disc online, however would a recent one of 
those work on this Mac?

Also what OS's will work on this it?  I have actually sent off for a copy of 
the Ubuntu for Mac CD which would at least let me see that everything is 
working OK, but it's not a long term solution as the whole idea of having a 
Mac is to be able to use the Mac software and learn about how about they 
work.

Thanks for your help in advance,

Celia
