Sorry, should have stated ATA/IDE drives (one original IBM and one 
Western Digital 40GB).

I suspect that you have your SCSI drives installed internally. I 
always had mine externally, because I was forever using the external 
drive as a portable drive to update/maintain my daughter's PM7200 at 
college. I used an Adaptec 2930U for four years to boot off an 
external SCSI Zip 100 for maintenance purposes on my PM7500, along 
with a SCSI II Drive out of a server (that I could not terminate) and 
Yamaha 8424 burner. Whether it was memory, termination, or whatever, 
the inability to boot off of the ZIp drive with the disk maintenance 
and recovery programs was more important than figuring out 
termination, the right SCSI cable etc. With the 7500, all was well, 
but with the G4 I began to have boot problems in OSX. I originally 
bought the Orange Micro 907 as a second external SCSI link, then 
later bought the 930U, mostly because they were half the price of the 
Adaptec 29160, and I wanted to reduce desktop clutter.

&gt;<i>I'm using the cheapest Adaptect card models, and it boots in either

</I>
You mean you don't recall the howl of discontent over the continued 
lack of SCSI support in the Apple and MacFixit Forums every time a 
new build of OSX came out? And why there was need for SCSI Helper, 
etc? I guess I am an early adopter and like to experiment a lot with 
shareware, so the inability to boot off of my external Zip drive in 
OS 9.2.2 drove the move away from SCSI and to FireWire.

&gt;<i>Where did you get that idea?
</I>

Oh, I am aware from reading forums that folks are still using SCSI, 
especially for RAID and other fast storage devices, but I can't 
afford, nor need those kinds of devices. What Adaptec card do you 
have?
