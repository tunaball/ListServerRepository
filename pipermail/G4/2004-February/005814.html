Actually, it doesn't really mean anything to say the OS gets X% scaling 
efficiency. If the threads are highly decoupled, you can get near 100% 
scaling benefit with any fabric and OS. If the threads are highly 
coupled, it can quickly become an intractable software problem for any 
cluster. The factors that determine scalability are how much 
synchronization is required by the application, and the synchronization 
performance across nodes. The kernel overhead will generally be a minor 
factor, sometimes orders of magnitude less.

Think about a system like <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/g4.html">SETI at home.</A> Each node in this system works 
independently on a block of data, and the time spent retrieving and 
sending data is a relatively small part of the overall effort. This 
system achieves nearly 100% scaling performance even with a slow 
dial-up fabric; 10 equivalent machines will do 10 times the work of one 
machine, and it really doesn't matter what kind a machines they are, or 
what OS they are running.

On the other hand, systems that depend on entirely Symmetric multi 
processing (SMP) usually break down with more than a handful of 
processors. That's why SMP machines are usually limited to 2-4 
processors. Unlike a cluster, an SMP machine must share resources 
almost all the time. In particular, the memory bandwidth can easily 
become choked if more than about 4 processors are sharing it. That's 
why big iron SGIs and Suns, and even the bigger Xeon machines use 
asymmetric multi processing to squeeze as many as 256 processors into 
one system.

Bottom line is that for ideal applications Clusters will always scale 
perfectly. Of course there are no ideal applications that do much of 
anything useful. The challenge is to architect your problems in a way 
that makes the least use of sychronization, and at the same time make 
your system synchronization as efficient as possible. The range of 
applications that can be tackled on massive cluster grows with both 
efforts.
