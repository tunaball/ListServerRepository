<PRE>Renita,
There are also two PCI TV cards - Alchemy TV by Miglia (at OWC 
[macsales.com] among others) and Televio by Meilenstein (at drbott.com, 
perhaps others). I have been exploring this as well. I finally bought 
an EyeTV on eBay because it has had the longest to let the software 
mature. I was leaning toward the Alchemy card, because the PCI format 
appealed more to me than the USB external setup of the EyeTV, but I 
read on xlr8yourmac.com that the software still leaves much to be 
desired, as I recall the first few versions of EyeTV did. The EyeTV 
software has improved quite a bit since it was first introduced 
according to what I have read. (I just got my EyeTV today and haven't 
even hooked it up yet.)
As far as I can tell, the PCI cards will produce better quality video. 
That is not really my primary concern, as I will mainly use it to watch 
sports while I'm doing other things at my computer. I don't plan on 
recording a lot of it, burning to disk and watching it on TV. If you 
want to do a lot of recording and burning and want the best quality, 
the Alchemy is probably better suited than the EyeTV according to my 
research.  I understand that EyeTV has Toast integration, making it 
easy to burn your recorded shows to disk. I'm not sure about the 
others.  I don't know anything about MyTV/fm, but ATI also has an 
external USB TV pod than only works in OS 9/Classic, so I ruled it out 
immediately.
Xlr8yourmac.com has lots of reader reports on EyeTV and some on Alchemy 
TV, so you might try to continue your research there.
Hope this helps,
Mel
