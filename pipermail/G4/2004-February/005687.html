<PRE>I actually remember being in Alex's position at one point with all of 
you. This subject is dicey, accept it. I completely agree with Alex.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Look, this list doesn't just happen. There is a guy in Portland who

</I>&gt;<i> You posted a question, I pointed out to you that your question was 
</I>&gt;<i> dicey. At this point, it might conceivably be polite ask the list 
</I>&gt;<i> owner whether he objects to that particular topic or not before going 
</I>&gt;<i> on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not about self-censorship. You can search the net and you'll 
</I>&gt;<i> find tons of references to the subject; there are even Internet boards 
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated exclusively to exchanging info on how to pirate software -- 
</I>&gt;<i> and I shouldn't be surprised if there were one (or more) dedicated 
</I>&gt;<i> specifically to copying commercial DVDs. All that is between you, your 
</I>&gt;<i> ISP, and the people who post the info. But what is posted on this list 
</I>&gt;<i> -- if it is illegal -- might involve also the list owner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You start out by saying simply that &quot;In more than one country, the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you describe is illegal&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yet no further information is provided. Not which countries, no 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quoting of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> said laws, no links to the relative legal decisions, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you joking? You want me to provide you with a legal opinion, 
</I>&gt;<i> complete with full references on the issue? I'll be more than glad to. 
</I>&gt;<i> I charge USD 200/hour (dirt cheap, btw, in this business), and I 
</I>&gt;<i> estimate the research will take me about 12 hours. I'll start working 
</I>&gt;<i> on it as soon as I receive your cheque. (Incidentally, in one of the 
</I>&gt;<i> post I already provided you with some free tidbits of info -- see ref 
</I>&gt;<i> to Norway -- that's just to whet your appetite.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But the fact that said questions do slip thru and get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> posted does not constitute a prosecutable act on the list operator's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This has been established in law.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To quote from the classics: &quot; [...] no further information is 
</I>&gt;<i> provided. Not which countries, no quoting of said laws, no links to 
</I>&gt;<i> the relative legal decisions, etc.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But would a US-based list owner &quot;get in trouble&quot; for providing Chinese
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> citizens with the opportunity to break Chinese law?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably not. But he might &quot;get in trouble&quot; for providing anyone with 
</I>&gt;<i> the opportunity to break US law.
