Darryl,

On both G4's you can add a second drive without needing an ATA controller
card; the ATA card lets you add a third (or even fourth, though this
requires some internal creativity) and, as you wrote, lets you create a RAID
out of 2 drives; though some people question the value of RAIDs today, now
that huge hard drives are so cheap.
I have a 40GB and an 80GB HD in my G4 Sawtooth, both of which are Western
Digital drives. Prices are coming down and I can recommend the Western
Digital 8MB cache drives, though take a look at xlr8yourmac dot com for
reports on other brands. IIRC, I got a 3 year warranty on the Western
Digital 80GB drive, which is good for peace of mind.

My only experience with a PCI ATA controller was the VST Ultratek ATA/66,
which I used in my G3 Yosemite. It worked fine. It is still being sold on
ebay and the LEM swap list, for anywhere from $20 to $40; firmware was
released not too long ago making it compatible with Jaguar (don't know about
Panther). It's an interesting option, especially since many people have
written that hard drives don't gain much from going from an ATA/66 card to
an ATA/133. Again, xlr8 is a priceless resource for hard drives and PCI
controllers. They even provide illustrated instructions for adding 2nd and
3rd drives, setting the drive to Master or Slave, installing PCI cards, etc.

Good luck.

Chris
