<PRE>Kevin, this may or may not help.  I had the same type problems when I had 
9.2.2 installed.  Anything above 9.2.1 gives problems as standalones because 
they apparently are designed especially for use as OSX companion systems.  
When I went back to 9.2.1 it totally solved the problems.  I know how much 
people are enamoured of Jaguar and Panther but in my opinion 9.2.1 was the 
best system that Apple has come up with.  I'm glad to see that someone else 
is sticking with 9.  Sure saves me a lot of money to replace all my graphics 
and AV programs.

I also had similar problems that were solved by unplugging and replugging 
all the cables, especially if you are using any external SCSI drives of any 
type.  Weird things also happen if you don't have the Pioneer cable plugged 
in just right, that can even prevent startup.

I have just begun to have some weird issues with my G4/400.  It started with 
my display settings getting lost when I start it up. Today, the whole 
display profile that I set up  was gone as well as the monitor that I use.  
It wasn't listed in the display preferences. Also, the Pioneer DVD burner 
that I installed last week has been inconsistent ejecting CD's.  When I push 
the eject button on the keyboard, the cd is unmounted from the desktop, but 
the DVD rom doesn't spit it out.  When that happens, I can check it in the 
device manager and it shows up as not being supported for burning.  I can 
restart it and get it to work.  It even shows up as fully supported. Any 
thoughts?

Thanks

Kevin

P.S. I am running OS 9.2.8.
