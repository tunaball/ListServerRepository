<PRE>OS9 had some terrible bugs.  OS9.0.4 corrected most of those but still had 
stability problems.  OS9.1 was the best until 9.2.1, which I still believe 
is Apple's most complete and most stable system.  When I decided I had to 
have the latest on the block, OS9.2.2 I discovered that it was full of 
problems and had to reinstall 9.2.1.  I do have Jaguar on one drive (and it 
just now crashed) and I have Panther on another.  Unfortunately I cannot 
afford upgrades to all my programs just for the satisfaction of using X.  I 
wish I could because Panther does seem to be very complete and stable.  Yes, 
I'm guilty of beating that dead horse again :-)  I'm just saying don't give 
up on 9 if you can't afford upgrades to your old (but good) programs.  Just 
use 9.2.1.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

I have had weird issues in OS9.  OS9 corrupts a lot over time.  Take about 2 
years and the OS stops functioning as it should. Slows down, loses a few 
prefs etc..  Bad RAM is a very common problem.  Run a RAM checker for 8 - 24 
hours.

I highly recommend that, if possible you move into OSX 10.2 or later.  If 
you have a second HD in there you can try it out without disturbing you 
current OS9 set-up.
