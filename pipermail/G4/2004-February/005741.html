<PRE>
&gt;<i>Jaguar is Mac OS X v10.2. You may be talking about earlier versions 
</I>&gt;<i>of OS X. Jaguar supported SCSI out of the box.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>[...] the inability to boot off of my external Zip drive in OS 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>9.2.2 drove the move away from SCSI and to FireWire.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Are we talking OS X or OS 9.2.2? Are you talking SCSI problems or 
</I>&gt;<i>Zip drive problems?
</I>
A combination really. My problem was that I needed to boot my G4/400 
from the slower-than-molasses SCSI Zip 100 which was connected to the 
bootable Orange Micro 930U, with the external hard drive in the 
chain. This left the burner on the Orange Micro 907, which was too 
slow to support it. This was during the period when I was playing 
with OS 10.1 through OS 10.1.5, but doing my graphics work in OS 9.2.

So I fixed my boot issue and cluttered desktop by installing a second 
IDE internal drive, which has OS 9.2.2 and my OS 9 based diagnostic 
software on it. Then over the next year, bought my Pioneer DVD-RW 
DVR-105, a FireWire enclosure for the Hitachi CD/DVD-R that came in 
the G4, and eventually a second FireWrive enclosure for a 120GB 
ATA/IDE drive to back up everything on the previous two with 
Retrospect. Lesson learned with the SCSI external drive... backing up 
is much faster to a hard drive than CD-Rs, DVD-Rs or Zip drives.

Maybe I never gave Jaguar a chance with SCSI. By the time it was 
released, my daughter had moved from the PM7200 to an iMac 400 DV/SE 
and I never really needed SCSI, afterward. She is still using OS 
9.2.2, but I hardly ever use it any more. With exception of Shanghai 
II, which my wife loves, and TypeStyler3 for creating logos in 
encapsulated postscript for brochures, I could dump OS 9.2.2 and 
Classic altogether.
