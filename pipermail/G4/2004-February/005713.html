</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> He may indeed have a different point of view, I sincerely hope he

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I assume he's perfectly capable of telling me his point of view if he
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wants
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to, either on the list or privately.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Look, this list doesn't just happen. There is a guy in Portland who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provides resources and gives of his time to make sure this list works.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You posted a question, I pointed out to you that your question was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dicey. At this point, it might conceivably be polite ask the list 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> owner
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether he objects to that particular topic or not before going on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, and I did ask him to express his views, objections, etc. in 
</I>&gt;<i> my last
</I>&gt;<i> posting.
</I>&gt;<i> And you pointed out that my question was not &quot;dicey&quot;, but &quot;illegal in 
</I>&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;<i> than one country&quot;. But you didn't say which countries. You implied 
</I>&gt;<i> that one
</I>&gt;<i> of the countries was the USA, opining that the US-based listowner 
</I>&gt;<i> could get
</I>&gt;<i> in trouble re. US laws, but then you said that US law on the issue has 
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> been finalized yet, and may not be finalized for some time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is not about self-censorship. You can search the net and you'll
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> find tons of references to the subject; there are even Internet boards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dedicated exclusively to exchanging info on how to pirate software --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I shouldn't be surprised if there were one (or more) dedicated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specifically to copying commercial DVDs. All that is between you, your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ISP, and the people who post the info. But what is posted on this list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- if it is illegal -- might involve also the list owner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I referred to a tendency to self-censorship that can arise when people 
</I>&gt;<i> feel
</I>&gt;<i> threatened, or think they feel threatened. Self-censorship may even 
</I>&gt;<i> increase
</I>&gt;<i> in situations of legal ambiguity, in situations where laws, in fact, 
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> not been finalized. Our discussion of the laws on fair use copying of 
</I>&gt;<i> one's
</I>&gt;<i> own DVDs seems to indicate that at present there are no clear cut laws
</I>&gt;<i> against it, though there may be in the future, at least in the USA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You start out by saying simply that &quot;In more than one country, the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> operation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you describe is illegal&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yet no further information is provided. Not which countries, no
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> quoting of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> said laws, no links to the relative legal decisions, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are you joking? You want me to provide you with a legal opinion,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complete with full references on the issue? I'll be more than glad to.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I charge USD 200/hour (dirt cheap, btw, in this business), and I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> estimate the research will take me about 12 hours. I'll start working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on it as soon as I receive your cheque. (Incidentally, in one of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> post I already provided you with some free tidbits of info -- see ref
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Norway -- that's just to whet your appetite.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, thanks, I know enough Canadian lawyers already, though few of the 
</I>&gt;<i> dirt
</I>&gt;<i> cheap ones. What I did make reference to was your point-blank 
</I>&gt;<i> statement that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;in more than one country...&quot;, though you didn't list any. The 
</I>&gt;<i> Norwegian
</I>&gt;<i> tidbit was a ruling you said legalized DVD backups. But anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But the fact that said questions do slip thru and get
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> posted does not constitute a prosecutable act on the list operator's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> part.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This has been established in law.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To quote from the classics: &quot; [...] no further information is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provided.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not which countries, no quoting of said laws, no links to the relative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legal decisions, etc.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough, and haste makes waste. I'll trade ya my research for yers,
</I>&gt;<i> straight up, no cheques asked, none earned (or is it &quot;checks&quot;, seeing 
</I>&gt;<i> as you
</I>&gt;<i> work in USD?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But would a US-based list owner &quot;get in trouble&quot; for providing 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Chinese
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> citizens with the opportunity to break Chinese law?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Probably not. But he might &quot;get in trouble&quot; for providing anyone with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the opportunity to break US law.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which kind of takes us around in circles again, seeing as I'm not in 
</I>&gt;<i> the US,
</I>&gt;<i> nor (as some have said here) does the US yet have a law against DVD 
</I>&gt;<i> backups.
</I>&gt;<i> Nor does Italy. Further, I have no intention of copying US-made and
</I>&gt;<i> -distributed DVDs; indeed, I don't even own any.
</I>&gt;<i> Or are you referring to the fact that, if someone on the list were to 
</I>&gt;<i> answer
</I>&gt;<i> my original question, the list owner might get into trouble because a 
</I>&gt;<i> US
</I>&gt;<i> resident might read the exchange between me and another person, and 
</I>&gt;<i> use that
</I>&gt;<i> information to break US law, at some time in the future, if such a law 
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> ever passed in the US? Hmmm. I don't know. I mean, you may be right 
</I>&gt;<i> (that's
</I>&gt;<i> what you get the big bucks for, eh?), but heck. That's no way to go 
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> things. I guess at this point we could use some input from the 
</I>&gt;<i> listowner,
</I>&gt;<i> who no one wants to get in trouble.
</I>&gt;<i> (All I wanted to do was keep the kids' Nutella-soaked fingers off our 
</I>&gt;<i> good
</I>&gt;<i> copy of the Teletubbies!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Chris
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. Other lists I know of have list &quot;nannies&quot; to help the listowner. 
</I>&gt;<i> Though
</I>&gt;<i> probably far too long on wind and short on facts, I'd be more than 
</I>&gt;<i> willing
</I>&gt;<i> to help out in said role; though given his tone, temperament and 
</I>&gt;<i> vocation,
</I>&gt;<i> and despite the word's potentially offensive (to finely tuned Canadian 
</I>&gt;<i> ears)
</I>&gt;<i> sexist undertones, Alex may be the more suitable choice. Anyone?
