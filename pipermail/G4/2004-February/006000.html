<PRE> I have wanted to go back to 9.2.1 on one partition of my G4 but was told
that my 2003 dual boot mirror door G4 will not boot in anything older than
the 9.2.2 that was installed with it.

Is this really true, or does anyone have 9.2.1 installed on a new G4 mirror
door. I have a lot of instability with 9.2.2, but l enjoy working on OS 9
better than jaguar (no offense), not to mention the expense I have saved on
software by still using 9.

I tried removing the 3 &quot;Classic&quot; extensions as had been suggested to me, and
didn't see an improvement.

thanks
Christine



&gt;<i> OS9 had some terrible bugs.  OS9.0.4 corrected most of those but still had
</I>&gt;<i> stability problems.  OS9.1 was the best until 9.2.1, which I still believe
</I>&gt;<i> is Apple's most complete and most stable system.  When I decided I had to
</I>&gt;<i> have the latest on the block, OS9.2.2 I discovered that it was full of
</I>&gt;<i> problems and had to reinstall 9.2.1.  I do have Jaguar on one drive (and it
</I>&gt;<i> just now crashed) and I have Panther on another.  Unfortunately I cannot
</I>&gt;<i> afford upgrades to all my programs just for the satisfaction of using X.  I
</I>&gt;<i> wish I could because Panther does seem to be very complete and stable.  Yes,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm guilty of beating that dead horse again :-)  I'm just saying don't give
</I>&gt;<i> up on 9 if you can't afford upgrades to your old (but good) programs.  Just
</I>&gt;<i> use 9.2.1.
