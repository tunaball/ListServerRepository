<PRE>Greetings Aaron ( + )!( + )

You are correct, it's been such a long since I installed the second  
drive in my G4 that I had forgotten which drive went in which  
location. So I opened my case and verified that the bottom drive is  
the drive that is &quot;Drive 0&quot; and that it is on the end of the cable.

Then I checked my data base and here is what I found - it was taken  
from the manual that accompanied the NEW &quot;Powermac G4 AGP Graphics&quot;  
platform that I purchased in 1999

When I purchased the Mac the only drive was the one on the bottom and  
I'm not sure if it was on the end of the cable or on the middle  
connector.
----------------------------------------------------
Ultra ATA Drives
Your Macintosh can accommodate two internal ATA drives in the U-shaped  
drive carrier in
drive position 3 at the bottom of the computer. If you purchased a  
model with one Ultra ATA
drive, it sits in the lower portion of this U-shaped drive carrier.  
You can install a second ATA
drive in the upper part of the carrier.
The drive that came with your Macintosh is designated the primary  
drive (sometimes called
the &#8220;master drive&#8221; or &#8220;drive 0&#8221;). Therefore, an additional  
Ultra ATA drive must be con&#64257;gured
as the secondary drive (sometimes called the &#8220;slave drive&#8221; or  
&#8220;drive 1&#8221;). For more
information on con&#64257;guring an additional drive, see the documentation  
that came with it.
Your Macintosh will not work with Ultra ATA drives set for &#8220;cable  
select mode.&#8221;
	* This surely was surprise to me!
	I assume that ATA drive will operate in the cable select mode but not  
Ultra!
----------------------------------------------------
If you added a second ATA drive to a computer that came with one ATA  
drive, plug the
connector on the end of the ribbon cable to the drive on the bottom  
and attach the
cable&#8217;s middle connector to the top drive.
