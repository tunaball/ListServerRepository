<PRE>Robert,

Your email was delightful. I bought my first Mac when I could get either of
the two Steve's on the phone. This was because every so often we would hit a
dead end and since there wasn't an operating manual to go with our Apple II,
we had to call Calf. from Montreal to get answers. I still have the manual
they sent to me later. This was very early in the personal computer game. I
could be wrong but I think we received the first machine in late 1976 and we
received the manual for it in early 1977. The book is presently in storage
or I would get the specifics,  because it came with a form letter from Apple
explaining why the manual had not been ready when they shipped the Apple
IIs.

My partner at the time and I were ostensibly writing a book on Basic
language using these machines.  At least that is what I thought. What I
didn't know was that my partner was stealing small basic programs from DEC.
I didn't find that out until many years later. We sold the book to a
publisher who it seems went on to make a lot of money with it. We put the
book together for about $2500.00 in cash and no royalties. The book went on
to sell close to a million copies according to the U.S. Library of Congress.
That is a long and bizarre story. Ultimately we had cashed in our pop
bottles and sold the Altair 8800 we had keeping the front door open as a
door stop. At the time the Altair could do very little but the &quot;cool factor&quot;
of owning it was huge. Asking beautiful young ladies if they wanted to come
over to our office to see our computer... It was a technological up date on
the etchings query. To get the new Apples, we sold the Altair computer for
quite a bit of money for that time. After pooling our resources we had two
Apple II with various peripherals. We used Panasonic cassette decks for
storage and two 12inch B&amp;W televisions as monitors.

We had an amazing amount of fun during those years. It was a great way to
learn about computers.

Bill
