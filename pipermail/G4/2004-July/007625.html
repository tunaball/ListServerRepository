<PRE>Thanks for all your replies--unfortunately, I can't solve it right now 
because my friend will be out of town for awhile.  However, to reply to a 
couple of your queries:

The cable is not damaged, because we took the drive back to the 
desktop G4, and it shows up fine every time.

Also, the hard drive DID NOT show up on the laptop BEFORE we 
installed its software, and it also DID NOT show up AFTER.  There may 
be a software conflict, but it must be from something else previously 
installed.

His printer works--we tried it on both of the USB ports, so that doesn't 
seem to be the issue either.  I realize any version of OS9 should make 
it work--that's why I'm baffled that the older OS lets it work, but the 
newer doesn't.

I understand Steve's reply, but my friend doesn't have a firewire 
cable--the hard drive was his choice, so I need to make that work 
without spending any more of his money :-)

I think when he gets back from vacation, I'll take both machines up to 
9.2.1, do some different extension sets, and see what happens.

Thanks again!

another scott

&lt;He hooked up a external hard drive (USB) to his desktop G4 to copy

Did you simply move the external drive to the laptop and use the same 
USB cable? It IS possible that you have a damaged cable. Did you try 
other cables yet?

&lt;I tried to install the Apple 1.3.5 Mass Storage extension, but it said 
it wasn't needed on this machine.  The drive is an AcomData, and we 
installed the software that came with it on the Powerbook, but still no 
go.&gt;

As long as you are using OS 9+, you should not have had to add any 
other software. The machines and OSes that you list are capable of 
using USB without any added help. You may have created a conflict 
when 
you installed the new software. The laptop may not &quot;know&quot; which 
software to use and therefore simply stop trying to recognize the USB 
device. Have you tried connecting any other device to the laptop to 
determine whether it is ONLY the external drive that isn't working?

I suggest removing the new software and trying again with only the 
original OS software installed. You may have to do a re-install to get 
the USB functionality back if it has been corrupted in any way.

Happy hunting.
