</I>Best way to get Photoshop inexpensively is on the LEM list or ebay.  
Many times I have seen older Adobe Graphic Box Set (Acrobat, Photoshop, 
Illustrator and Indesign) sell cheap - under $100.  That whole suite 
can be upgraded as needed to OSX versions.  But in Photoshop be sure to 
get version 4 or higher, as the new upgrade recognize it without 
requiring to install the old version.  If you run your current version 
on your G4 it works.  This upgrade can wait until it annoys you to work 
in Classic.

</I>
SCSI is kind of dead in the consumer scanner area - no drivers, but 
Adaptec PCI Cards still work (some) and you can drive the scanner with 
VueScan.  I found a new USB scanner a much better deal - cheaper and 
better resolution.  Epson is very good,  but they need a powerbar to 
cut power (always on).  This is worth the money if you want away from 
the old 604.  New scanners tend to be smaller and lighter.

&gt;<i> The old machine has sound
</I>&gt;<i> input, and the new one seems to have forgotten that
</I>&gt;<i> Macs are good for AV and I do a lot of LP transfers.
</I>
Here, I must reccomend a great device Grifin Imic.  Audio in/out mini 
plugs to USB.  And Final Vinyl in a good LP (or any) recording program 
that is free and works as long as an Imic is plugged in - somewhere.  I 
have a CUBE and this is the best solution for many.  Again another big 
cut away from the 604.


These solutions all cost money but a new scanner and the Imic are cheap 
and shouldn't hold you back.  They also allow  you to retire that old 
604 to your favorite charity or school (get the receipt).  Photoshop, 
legally obtained, is difficult to find cheap.  Probably cost $200 or so 
for a used version and the upgrade.  You may find Photoshop 7 (OSX) is 
cheaper now that CS is out.  7 is pretty good.
