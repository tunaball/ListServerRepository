<PRE>Hello,

As you can see from the below series of messages, I can't post to the MacUSB
list, nor get a response from the listmom, et al -- this is the fifth
attempt. My sent mail doesn't get bounced back.

I've posted to the G4 list before, so I'm trying to get some answers here .
. .

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Jim Thornton

Subject: Can't Post to MacUSB List

Hello!

This is the fourth email that I've sent trying to find out why I can't post
to the USB list . . .

I've posted to the G4 list, but can't get to the USB list -- please help.

I've also tried to email the listmom and I'm now trying email to another
address to find out why I can't post a USB question (see question below).

Thanks,

Jim Thornton

Subject: Can't Post to USB List

Hi,

I've tried twice to post to the USB list, but neither time did anything show
up! I get the digest version, if that makes any difference.

I posted on May 20 and again on July 7. The first post was during a time
when there didn't seem to be any activity on the list -- at least I wasn't
getting any digests then. When activity resumed in early July, I tried
again, but to no avail. What am I doing wrong?

Jim Thornton

P.S. I'll copy my July 7th attempt below:

______________________________________________

I tried to post to this list back in May, but nothing was ever distributed.
I'll try again since there seems to be more activity lately . . .

Please forgive the lengthy post, but my problems are accumulating!

I&#185;ve got a Quicksilver G4 733 tower running OS X 10.3.4; I have an IOGEAR
two-port USB 2.0 PCI card (model GIC220U with the NEC chipset &#139; the IOGEAR
website specifically says don&#185;t install drivers for either the NEC or ALI
chipset in OS X 10.2.8 or later). My USB 2.0 scanner is connected to this
card; System Profiler properly recognizes it as a &#179;high-speed&#178; device since
10.3 (if I remember the point-version correctly). The scanner works and the
Mac will sleep and wake properly, both when I put it to sleep and when it
goes to sleep based on the energy saver settings.

First Problem. I bought an IOGEAR USB 2.0 media card reader (model GFR280)
to use in the second USB 2.0 port on the PCI card; note that IOGEAR provides
drivers only for pre-OS X, since &#179;none are needed for OS X.&#178; When I have it
plugged in to the PCI card, it will read data, but when the Mac attempts to
go to sleep, the monitor turns off, but the CPU remains running and freezes
necessitating a complete reboot. If I plug the card reader into a USB 1.1
port, the Mac sleeps/wakes perfectly. I spoke to IOGEAR tech support, but
they didn&#185;t have an answer except to say that since I had several USB
peripherals (doesn&#185;t everybody?), the system may be &#179;using too many
resources,&#178; whatever that means. They suggested I remove some/all of the USB
devices and try again (at that point, I told tech support I&#185;d hang up and
try it on my own). I removed all the USB devices except the keyboard and
mouse, then plugged the USB 2.0 card reader into the USB 2.0 PCI card &#139; when
I did that, I still had the same freeze problem. (Unplugging the device
doesn&#185;t unfreeze the Mac.)

To try to get a working USB 2.0 capability, I next purchased a MacSense USB
2.0 PCI card, but it didn't work properly either. It seemed to work the
first time, but never after that: it didn't show up in system profiler,
didn't connect devices, and caused my Mac to freeze. MacSense tech support
wasn't any help. I returned the MacSense card.

I went to the local Apple Store and checked out my media reader card in a
new Mac with a native USB 2.0 port; the Mac slept/woke properly. I asked a
&quot;genius&quot; what USB 2.0 PCI cards he could suggest that would work in my Mac;
he responded that he didn't know for sure, but that Orange Micro had been
making Mac cards longer than anybody and that their card might be the best
bet. I emailed Orange Micro asking if their OrangeUSB 2.0 PCI card would
work properly in my Mac; their response was that it might not sleep properly
(scratch Orange Micro -- I'm now 0 for 3).

I've looked at my local Fry's for USB 2.0 PCI cards that might describe
themselves as Mac OS X friendly, but there were only two possibilities: a
D-Link DU-520 and a Belkin F5U220. I didn't buy either one -- I'm still
investigating. Does anybody have any experience/advice on these or any other
cards?

Second Problem. I recently bought an IOMEGA USB 1.1 Zip drive. When it is
plugged into a USB 1.1 port, it works and the Mac goes to sleep/wakes up
properly. When it&#185;s plugged into the USB 2.0 card, it will work, but when
the Mac goes to sleep, it won&#185;t wake from sleep (ie, at that point, the Mac
is frozen and unplugging the device doesn&#185;t unfreeze the Mac).

I believe OS X 10.3 is supposed to know whether a USB 1.1 or 2.0 device is
connected to a USB 2.0 port (which in my case is on the PCI card I
installed, since I don't have any built-in 2.0 ports) and show &#179;up to 12
Mb/sec&#178; or &#179;up to 480 Mb/sec,&#178; respectively. System Profiler seems to bear
out this belief by recognizing the proper bus and device speeds with my
IOGear PCI card (although System Profiler doesn&#185;t show the correct topology
for the USB device tree &#139; it has devices hanging off the wrong buses).

I was happy when OS X (10.3 or 10.2.8?) finally recognized my IOGear PCI
card as a 2.0 interface device and hoped my problems were solved. However,
that wasn't to be the case . . .

Any help would be much appreciated!

Jim Thornton
