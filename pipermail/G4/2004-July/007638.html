<PRE>Hello all,

I am thinking about possibly upgrading my 533DP with one of the DP 
upgrades being produced by either Powerlogix, Sonnet, or Gigadesigns.  
As they all seem a tad overpriced, it looks like I may have to settle 
on something in the 1.2GHz range.

Does anyone here have any good user stories featuring these processor 
upgrades as a main character?  I notice Gigadesigns has a unit that has 
two overclocked 1000MHz chips, running at 1.2GHz for under $600.00 AND 
a unit with two genuine 1.25GHz chips running between 1.2 and 1.33GHz 
for about $90.00 more.  As it gets pretty hot in my dwelling place, 
should I eschew the overclocked board for the pricier one?

I had hoped to hold out until there were upgrades of close to three 
times that which I currently have, as that would seem to cross some 
psychological price-performance threshold, but it is starting to look 
like there may never be G4s above 1.5GHz.  I'm also starting to doubt 
that there will be any dual 1.5GHz upgrade boards anytime soon as 
well...  Has anyone heard different?

Any known issues running these upgrades with 10.3?

This all has suddenly come up as I would like shorter rendering times 
for video and faster MPEG encoding times for possible DVDs.  Also, 
someone has recently given me copies of Unreal Tournament 2003 and 
Battlefield 1942, both of which require more oomph than my machine has 
currently got.  Anyone know if those games are more processor or 
graphics card bound on a Mac?  I can't afford both a hot new video card 
AND a processor upgrade, so on that front, would I get more gaming 
mileage out of, say a Radeon 9800 or a dual 1.2GHz upgrade..?

Thanks in advance,

N.

</PRE>
