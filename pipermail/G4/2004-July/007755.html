Yup - It's a customized option called &quot;Archive and Install&quot;. It backs up
your old System Folder and keeps the User data and other important 
things
and brings it over to Panther.

Whoa up for a minute.

The issue here is NOT to perform a new installation, but to perform an 
upgrade WITHOUT having to do the new installation.

Doing an &quot;Archive and Install&quot; does indeed make a new installation 
which WILL REQUIRE that all old settings, etc., will need to be brought 
into the new installation from the &quot;archived&quot; system. It doesn't appear 
that this is what is wanted.

To do a simple system version upgrade, insert the installation CD into 
the Mac and run the install program. It will recognize the old system 
and upgrade it to the version on the CD and it will automatically bring 
forward all the old settings into the newer system version. There will 
be no need to manually bring all the old data into the new system.

However, sometimes it is advisable to do the &quot;Archive and Install&quot; 
option. Especially when there may be some corruption in the old system 
that needs to be corrected and/or there is old data that needs to be 
preserved.

And, of course, it is always advisable to repair permissions before and 
after performing the upgrade installation. Many of my friends repair 
permissions on a regular schedule to avoid problems. I do it every 
other month on all four of my machines.
