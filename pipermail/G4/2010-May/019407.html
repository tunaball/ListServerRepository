<PRE>Greetings,

&quot;B&quot; there are a couple of questions that you need to answer before  
anyone can provide you with on-line help.

What is the video card that your monitor is connected.
And to what is your CD/DVD RW connected, and what is the make and model.

You should be able to find most of this information under the Apple  
~About This Mac ~More Info...

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> I just subscribed to this list because I just got a used G4 M8573

</I>&gt;<i> printer - an HP 4Plus. Every time I would print something, it would  
</I>&gt;<i> print an extra sheet with always the same error - OFFENDING  
</I>&gt;<i> COMMAND.That was an unnecessary waste of paper. I switched printer  
</I>&gt;<i> drivers from what was installed for my printer to another driver in  
</I>&gt;<i> the database and I never have had that problem again and my printer  
</I>&gt;<i> is back to normal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problems that remain to be solved is 1) I also purchased a  
</I>&gt;<i> monitor that doesn't work with my computer. The HDI connector works  
</I>&gt;<i> fine with an ViewSonic monitor but the new monitor which has an ADC  
</I>&gt;<i> connector doesn't. I don't know if it is the monitor or the  
</I>&gt;<i> computer. Nothing lights up on the monitor, so I am assuming there  
</I>&gt;<i> is no power getting to the monitor. I have called a repair shop and  
</I>&gt;<i> for only $79.95 they will check it for me immediately. I don't want  
</I>&gt;<i> to spend the money, because I already have a monitor that works plus  
</I>&gt;<i> a monitor with an ADC connector that at this point is surplus,  
</I>&gt;<i> because I don't know if it works or not!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The other problem that I am having is with the DVD RW combo unit.  
</I>&gt;<i> I cannot seem to get it to recognize ANY DVDs - even pre-recorded  
</I>&gt;<i> ones, much less burnable ones. It tries to read them for a while and  
</I>&gt;<i> then always spits them out. Leopard recognizes that the drives are  
</I>&gt;<i> there, but I can only read from the CD drive
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have suggestions for me to try?
