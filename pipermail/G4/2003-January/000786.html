<PRE>Hi!

One thing to note: there are certain characters (and file name lengths) that Macs will not accept that Windows will let you get away with. A couple examples of this are commas, slashes, quotation marks, and ampersands (&amp;). Macs *really* don't like these in the filename, as well as some other non-letter/number characters. Macs also tend to really dislike Windows files with names over 28 characters. Windows will allow you to have up to 256 characters in a file name (depending on it's location within the file system and the version of Windows). If I remember correctly, OS9 will allow you to rename files that don't conform to its naming structure, but will prevent you from opening the file until you rename it.

Hope this helps!

No, it should work fine, and it should be able to keep the long filenames.

Being a recent &quot;switcher&quot;, I found I had to resist doing things I would 
have had to do in windoze, and instead let the Mac do it if it even 
needed doing at all.

I have 9.2.2 and X.1.5, and altough I prefer X, I have to go back and 
forth; it's pretty painless.
