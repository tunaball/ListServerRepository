<PRE>OS 9 was nice in its time, but X is so much better IMO.  I would say
defently go to Jaguar unless he has some hardware or software that's needs
9, although classic works great for most issues.  9 is fast but that's
really the only advantage over X that I can see.  X is solid as a rock
(leave it running for weeks at a time), hardly ever locks up (which 9 does
constantly), and has so many more advantages.  For most users who just use
internet apps and the iApps, X is very easy to learn.  Powerusers who like
to tweak everything on their OS have a steeper learning curve.  And if you
want to learn Unix... Well that's a whole nother subject.  But the great
thing is you have the power of unix if you need it, but never have to touch
it if you don't want to.  So my vote is to go with X.

Hi, Tracker -

Not taking anything negatively, am using all 9 stuff on the current machine
I have at home (G4 733 Tower). His issue is merely that everything on his
machine (G4 iMac) is OSX *EXCEPT* the scanner and this has been a pain in
the butt from Day 1. Epson sent him a note saying sorry, drivers would not
be upgraded for OSX versions up to Jaguar. So if he got Jaguar he could
leave the 9 world forever.

I'm like you, don' t have $4,000 lying around either. &lt;wicked grin&gt;
