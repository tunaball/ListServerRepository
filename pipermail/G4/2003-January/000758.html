Ahhh ...

Now here's another question, and is there another Mac advantage to
put on my list?

The same friend was worrying about some hard drive problems on the
desktop machine that is running Windows 2000, and was having trouble
getting the CD-ROM burner working also. She wanted to back up her
files, and seemed caught in this double glitch.

I had a couple suggestions, among which was to download the files
to her laptop, running Windows 98, if there was enough hard drive
space. She said this wasn't possible because the hard drives are
a different standard.

I have not had trouble copying files anywhere I want from any
Mac machine to any other Mac, space permitting.

I have felt stupid on occasion giving advice to Windows folks,
because they can't do quite a bit, or at least I don't know how
to do it.

The other question, which is on topic, is whether there are
any similar glitches moving from OS9 to X. There haven't
seemed to be any, from my limited experience going back
and forth between Dad's machine running OS X.1.1 and mine
running 9.2.1. Files go back and forth just fine.
