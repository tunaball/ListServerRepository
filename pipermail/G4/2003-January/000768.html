I have a 733 DA.  I was tempted to upgrade to a MDD dual 867 but when I 
tested the two
side by side I found little difference between them for what I do. I'm 
sure if your doing more
processor intense stuff or more multitasking you would see speed 
benefits with the MDD.

Keep in mind that the Dual 867 has a 133 system bus like the DA, not 
the 167 like the
dual 1G and 1.25G MDD.

I have also read reports that the G4 doesn't take full advantage of the 
DDR RAM. Claims have
been made on Powerlogix site that DA Macs upgraded with faster G4's 
benchmark the same as
the new DDR Mac's.

It could be that the new MDD mac's were supposed to have a new 
processor (G5) which fell through
last spring so as a fall back position Apple equipped the new 
motherboard with what was available(G4).
  Using DDR memory sounds better for marketing as well.

In any case, unless you have a specific need for DVD-R I wouldn't 
bother yet, as prices are likely to
drop significantly in the next year. Keep in mind Apple is still trying 
to limit iDVD to &quot;Apple Only&quot; drives,
so unless this changes a third party DVD-R may be problematic.

Another thing to consider, is that MDD Mac's easily accept two 5 1/4&quot; 
optical drives. It was quite a war
installing two into my DA. Big expensive tower with one optical drive, 
lasted about a week around my house
before  the tools came out!

God luck!

Vern.
