<PRE>The logic board died in my Yikes! Friday night so I went off to the 
Apple Store to buy another. First time I have ever bought a current 
shipping machine. While I love it, I know sticker shock will set in 
as soon as that first bill rolls in. &lt;sigh&gt;

I was pretty shocked to see the 80G IBM Deskstar in there. I know so 
many have complained about them, I though Apple had stopped using 
them. Or has IBM actually changed them and made them better?

So if nothing has changed, I am going under the assumption that it 
will fail. Assuming that, besides doing frequent backups, am I better 
off using the 80G as a storage device and booting machine from  one 
of my older ATA-66 IDE 10G drives?

Or do I just make one of the 10G drives bootable also and keep it up 
to date so if the 80g goes down I can still use the machine. Or any 
other combination.....

I have the 80G, 2 IDE 10G's, an external USB 10G (are those 
bootable?) and an 18.2G internal SCSI that I haven't been able to 
install yet as I can't push the cage up after releasing it, it's 
stuck. There is hope I will find a cheap logic board for the Yikes! 
so I can set it back up as a development machine.

Is it possible to get a replacement from the Apple Store when it dies 
or is it more complicated than that?

Any advice from those that have been there would be great. I was 
really looking forward to 80G!  :)


Thanks,

Diane
