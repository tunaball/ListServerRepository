<PRE>
Stephanie,
  Use the following link to the Linksys website for configuration 
instructions: <A HREF="http://www.linksys.com/Products/product.asp?grid=23&prid=20">http://www.linksys.com/Products/product.asp?grid=23&amp;prid=20</A>

Actually, they have a link on that page for mac installation that leads 
to a Macworld article describing the proper setup for Macs. For 'cross' 
mac pc installation, Linksys originally told me to use the pc as the 
'primary' host (following the instructions on the linksys website, and 
then configure the mac's tcp-ip panel with the proper IP and other info.

Basically, instead of putting your ISP's IP and DNS info into your 
computer(s) network panel, you will enter that into the config panel for 
the router. You set the computer's network panel to connect via DHCP. 
(Occasionally, I've had problems with the DHCP setup, and had to resort 
to manually entering the IP address of the router into the computer's 
network panel).

Also, in response to the comment on this list that   you will need a 
firewall for a 'mixed' Mac, PC config, the router IS the firewall, 
that's one of its advantages, apart from allowing several computers to 
connect to the net. Only the router's IP address is visible to the 
'outside,' effectively shielding your computer(s) from unauthorized access.
Good Luck,

Judy Antipin

</I>&gt;<i> This brings to mind a question I've been mulling over for a while. If it is 
</I>&gt;<i> possible to use one router for a Mac and a PC, how do I configure it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another question: Which brand would best support both? I've noticed the 
</I>&gt;<i> Linksys seem to be reasonably priced, but I cannot find where they support 
</I>&gt;<i> Macs. I've looked at a Mac router that was almost twice as expensive as the 
</I>&gt;<i> PC routers. I'd rather not spend a large amount of money on a Mac router, 
</I>&gt;<i> when a PC router is cheaper and will work for both.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't bought a router yet. I'm just trying to do research before I spend 
</I>&gt;<i> the money.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've had  the Linksys BEFSR41 router for over two years and it's always
</I>&gt;<i> worked great. I disagree about the attitude of Linksys about macs.  I
</I>&gt;<i> never had any problem with their tech support (or much need to call
</I>&gt;<i> them)- ok, they don't officially support macs, but they gave me enough
</I>&gt;<i> info to do it fine, and even referred me to other websites for more
</I>&gt;<i> info. At first I had a mac and pc configured together on it, has been
</I>&gt;<i> two macs since Feb. when I bought my G4. I also called them to ask if
</I>&gt;<i> this router supported LAN networking between the two macs. They said not
</I>&gt;<i> officially, but it was capable of doing that, and gave the addresses of
</I>&gt;<i> two mac websites that offered explicit directions. So, in addition to
</I>&gt;<i> having both machines access the net through the router, I can also share
</I>&gt;<i> files between them via the router.   A couple of times when I had
</I>&gt;<i> questions, like when I changed cable providers and had to go to DHCP, I
</I>&gt;<i> just went to the Linksys website and followed the directions. Can't even
</I>&gt;<i> remember if they specifically addressed macs, but heck, a TCP-IP panel
</I>&gt;<i> isn't too hard to configure on either platform.
