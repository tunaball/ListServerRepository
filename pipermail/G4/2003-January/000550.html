</I>I am running 10.2.3 on my old 350 G4 Sawtooth with 512 ram and while I 
admit I notice somewhat slower Finder behaviors, it is not so slow that 
it bothers me. Fact is I have come to love OSX so much, I just learn to 
live with it. I have to boot into 9 occasionally to use Photoshop and 
am always amazed at how fast everything is now (before I switched to X 
I had only 256 ram and the original Western Digital HD) but I still 
can't wait to get back to X. Right now it is stable as a rock, I never 
reboot except when installing something that demands it, almost never 
have any sort of crash and that is enough in itself to keep me with it. 
There are mixed opinions but I happen to think the look of it is 
beautiful too and 9 sometimes looks so dowdy now when going back to it. 
My one big beef is that I too bought the new ATI video card to for 200 
bucks because I just HAD to be able to use quartz extreme and I noticed 
very little difference, my graphics were pretty great before. Some see 
major improvements in speed after repairing disk permissions from the 
disk utility application. Good luck.
