 &gt;Welcome to one of windoze many dirty little 
secrets: nothing has been
 &gt;updated since DOS, only patches upon patches. 
Filenames are stored this

file names.

Ahhh ...

&lt;Now here's another question, and is there another 
Mac advantage to
put on my list?

The other question, which is on topic, is whether 
there are
any similar glitches moving from OS9 to X. There 
haven't
seemed to be any, from my limited experience going 
back
and forth between Dad's machine running OS X.1.1 
and mine
running 9.2.1. Files go back and forth just fine.&gt;


Nothing updated (newly writen) just patch...
Sounds alot like Apple-OS9 is based upon the same 
principals as OS6-just patched alot. So this is 
not an uncommon occurance. I think Apple is the 
first OS to really rewrite it all and present a 
&quot;finished&quot; OS to the users. I would not be 
surprised if Microsoft started anew in the next 
few years to catch their OS back up to OSX es high 
mark.

As to OS9 file compatibility in OSX, I was 
completely surprised to find that my printers PPD 
files (in OS9) can be dropped into OSX 10.2.3 and 
continue to do their job flawlessly. That is 
compatability. I have seen very little problems 
with Acrobat5, Photoshop7 and Illustrator10 
opening files in OSX that were created in OS9. But 
I must admit I have not used OSX enough to be very 
definative.
