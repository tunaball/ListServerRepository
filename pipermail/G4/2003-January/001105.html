<PRE>Maurice,
I have the Quicksilver 2002 933 MHz single-processor with the 
Superdrive and it does quite well with the iMovie and DVD-burning 
applications you are wanting to do. It seems very fast to me and I 
would think the single 1GHz machine would work even better. After 
adding the Superdrive you would still be $300 under the Dual. I don't 
know if iMovie is dual-processor aware or not; maybe somebody else on 
the list knows. My $0.02.
I have the .Mac service that I got when it was offered at $49 with 100 
free iPhoto prints, which made it essentially free to me. My wife likes 
the games that were offered with it, also, so for us it was a pretty 
good deal. The email is nice, since I have been using this address 
since iTools first came out. You'll have to decide if the add-ons make 
sense for you.
