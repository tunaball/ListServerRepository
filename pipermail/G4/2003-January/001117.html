<PRE>&gt;<i>From today's MacFixIt (click here for entire text and pics)
</I>&lt;<A HREF="http://www.macfixit.com/staticpages/index.php?page=20030131071918881">http://www.macfixit.com/staticpages/index.php?page=20030131071918881</A>&gt;:

Thanks to well placed sources outside of Apple who wish to remain
anonymous, we are able to bring you news of a fix for the widely reported
eMac &quot;raster shift&quot; screen defect, which generated more complaints and
general discussion in the MacFixIt mailboxes than any other event in the
past six months.

The problem
We previously reported that some resellers actually stopped selling the
units to due to such high failure rates.

The &quot;raster shift&quot; problem, as it has been dubbed on a number of discussion
boards and in letters we've receive - occurs in anywhere from 15 to 60
percent of in-dealer inventories according to a MacFixIt poll of resellers.

In most cases, the problem causes the bottom third or half of the screen to
go black, with the rest of image shifting upward and out is de the top
boundary of the display. Serious static also accompanies the problem,
rendering the viewable part of the screen virtually useless.

The Fix
Resolving the eMac &quot;raster shift&quot; issue involves the fairly straightforward
replacement of a single component - the IVAD cable.

Apparently it took engineers some time to identify this cable as the
culprit, as many repair shops reported to MacFixIt that they were receiving
PAV units - which are large 'one piece' components with the power supply,
video board and monitor all in one - from Apple's warranty department.

A warm feeling of relief should come to those afflicted with the eMac
&quot;raster shift&quot; problem upon reading the first paragraph of the
Apple-produced IVAD cable replacement instructions &quot;The following
instructions explain how to replace the IVAD cable in an eMac computer.
Replace the IVAD cable if the eMac raster shifts upward from the bottom of
the display or the raster is jumpy.&quot;

The procedure, which should only be performed by skilled Apple authorized
technicians, requires a 2.5 mm hex tool, a Phillips #2 screwdriver, a
hot-melt glue gun, and a nylon probe tool.

Upon removing the rear case housing from the eMac, one has to locate the
IVAD assembly remove the old cable (which is held down with adhesive),
insert the replacement, and glue the new cable into place.

The IVAD is an approximately 5 inch multi-colored band of cable with black
connectors on either end (see picture below).

It should be noted that attempting this procedure yourself could void your
Apple warranty. If you are having the raster shift issue, call an
authorized Macintosh repair location immediately and inquire about the new
IVAD cable replacement fix.
