<PRE>I second this emotion. My sister went from iMac G3/600 to iMac G4/800 
in about two months. When going from one machine to the next, she also 
went from OS 9 to OS X! She has only a Handspring connected to her 
computer but both she and it made it just fine. This is basically her 
first computer and she surprises me with what she can accomplish in X! 
Push dad on, he will be just fine,

</I>&gt;<i> Not taking anything negatively, am using all 9 stuff on the current
