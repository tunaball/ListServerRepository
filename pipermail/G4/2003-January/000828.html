&quot;Should I create a new partition for OSX?
And then what data or files do I need to copy or 
transfer over to this new
volume? Do I need to install OS9.2 also on this 
new partition? How about all
the internet stuff?  Do I just move my apps or do 
I need to re-install on
the OSX partition?


B) I also have a Beige Power Mac G3 I
am trying to install OSX.2 on the first partition 
which is the 8Gb. I keep
getting an error message that I have to install 
OSX on the first 8Gb of the
drive -- which I thought I was doing?&quot;

If you create new partitioins with your OSX CD you 
will erase the entire drive. So back it up first. 
Maybe on your G3 through ethernet.

Copy your data files from your back-up into your 
newly partitioned drive after you instal the OSes.

Re-install all your apps-many OS9 apps do not work 
in X. Upgrade your Apps to work woth OSX and 
change some of them-like Graphics Converter 
instead of MacLink, Safari instead of Netscape or 
IE, etc.


If you used the G3 to back-up data before you 
partitioned and installed on your G4 now you can 
do the same thing again-just the other way 
arround. Wipe the drive, partition and install. 
Pain in the ass but it's the best way.

I have found that a clean install of OSX seems to 
work very well and have not had any problems. I do 
however erase the drive with the CD and then 
install OSX first, update it and then install OS9 
on the second partition and update it. Then, if 
you have classic apps pick classic a in your OSX 
prefs. And install everything you want. The 
advantage to OSX and OS9 on different partitions 
is when you need to reinstall one of them. (just 
one) I have also found that most every app in OS9 
has a counterpart in OSX already-it's not like 
OSX10 or 10.1 when it was too new to have 
everything you need. Age has its benefits. I found 
that I do not want OS9 to launch at all-so update 
the apps is key.
