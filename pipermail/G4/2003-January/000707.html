<PRE>Hi,

No answers, just more of the same problem,,, G4 450 DP (gig 
ethernet), factory SCSII card (the one that works), 256 MB,  OS 9.2.2 
0nly.

Began some time after adding a new IBM Deskstar 60 gig drive and 
reformatting the original 40 gig Deskstar with a clean OS 
install/upgrade  (I did use the old prefs and now wish I hadn't been 
so lazy). A power-off freeze (no LCD/optical mouse lights) requiring 
restart independent of ports/hub has been plaguing me occasionally 
since. It was initially a lot worse than now... Both ports would go 
out sometimes, and it often required multiple restarts to shake it 
off. The weird thing is that most of the time, only the Apple Pro 
mouse goes out, some of the time the mouse and Apple Pro keyboard, 
and rarely both ports(hub). The other weird thing is that it got 
better.. crashing only about once a week with occasional hangs which 
makes me think hardware. The only thing I've done differently is 
remove a few extensions and upgraded Windows Media Player &amp; Eudora. 
Sometimes happens with extensions off if I remember correctly. Don't 
have an extra keyboard or mouse to do the obvious, have rebuilt the 
desktop and zapped the pram.

Possibly another related issue. Indexing of both drives is taking 
forever (days) and I'm not sure if it ever has finished both between 
crashes/shut-downs.

Thanks

Frank
