<PRE>This brings to mind a question I've been mulling over for a while. If it is 
possible to use one router for a Mac and a PC, how do I configure it?

Another question: Which brand would best support both? I've noticed the 
Linksys seem to be reasonably priced, but I cannot find where they support 
Macs. I've looked at a Mac router that was almost twice as expensive as the 
PC routers. I'd rather not spend a large amount of money on a Mac router, 
when a PC router is cheaper and will work for both.

I haven't bought a router yet. I'm just trying to do research before I spend 
the money.

Thanks,

Stephanie

I've had&#160; the Linksys BEFSR41 router for over two years and it's always
worked great. I disagree about the attitude of Linksys about macs.&#160; I
never had any problem with their tech support (or much need to call
them)- ok, they don't officially support macs, but they gave me enough
info to do it fine, and even referred me to other websites for more
info. At first I had a mac and pc configured together on it, has been
two macs since Feb. when I bought my G4. I also called them to ask if
this router supported LAN networking between the two macs. They said not
officially, but it was capable of doing that, and gave the addresses of
two mac websites that offered explicit directions. So, in addition to
having both machines access the net through the router, I can also share
files between them via the router.&#160;&#160; A couple of times when I had
questions, like when I changed cable providers and had to go to DHCP, I
just went to the Linksys website and followed the directions. Can't even
remember if they specifically addressed macs, but heck, a TCP-IP panel
isn't too hard to configure on either platform.
