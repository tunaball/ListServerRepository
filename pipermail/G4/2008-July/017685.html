<PRE>Greetings ( + )!( + )

What is your console log file saying when this happens?
Open and monitor the console and system log files.
You'll find the &quot;console&quot; in ~disk/Applications/Utilities

</I>&gt;<i> drive's icons (I've got it in two partitions, one backs up my  
</I>&gt;<i> system) disappearing and then reappearing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I unmounted the drive, turned it off, unplugged the cable and the

</I>&gt;<i> ends. Then I turned the device one. A few minutes later, I got  
</I>&gt;<i> another unmount error. .
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> no idea why; their disagreement started eight months ago when I had  
</I>&gt;<i> to move the multiport card to another PCI slot to put in a 'deep  
</I>&gt;<i> case' fan that fits in a PCI slot when I upgraded the video card to  
</I>&gt;<i> a Geforce 6200 to handle the heat. The multiport uses jumper cables  
</I>&gt;<i> to hood to the mac's system and I've had to disconnect the firewire  
</I>&gt;<i> one. The USB jumper is with all my other devices on a USB 2.0 card I  
</I>&gt;<i> have installed.  I have sleep turned off, since my quicksilver  
</I>&gt;<i> didn't do well with it before the GeForce card was installed, and  
</I>&gt;<i> now it can cause drives to hang, and the monitor absolutely refuses  
</I>&gt;<i> to sleep ever since I moved the PCI cards around to install the fan.  
</I>&gt;<i> (Monitor sleep worked when I first put the new vidcard on. Go  
</I>&gt;<i> figure.) Ordinarily the unmount seems to happen about once a day,  
</I>&gt;<i> and usually at night, or when the drives are idle
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The drive is currently sitting atop the mac. Could this cause a  
</I>&gt;<i> problem? (I hope not, as I've no idea where in hell else I'd put it,  
</I>&gt;<i> but I may try moving it anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no other firewire device, period. The conjunction of this and  
</I>&gt;<i> the USB failure is what I find particularly disturbing. Is this  
</I>&gt;<i> coincidence or is something very, very wrong? Is there any sort of  
</I>&gt;<i> hardware test that could help me work this out?
