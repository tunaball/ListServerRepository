<PRE>Greetings,
 
I have a G4 DP 500 Mhz., 512 mgs. Ram, ATI Rage 16 mgs. video card, an
IBM 30 Gig 7200 rpm primary HD and a Western Dig. 20 Gig secondary drive
used for capturing small video projects. OSX 10.4.9 was installed along
with &quot;bonus&quot; software when I bought the machine off eBay last year.
Recently, just out of nowhere a dialog boxed popped up asking for a
password to my system. Not having one, I contacted the previous owner
who couldn't come up with anything that worked. So, I bought a retail
version of Tiger 10.4 (eBay) and began reinstalling OSX and that is when
various problems began. First of all, the OSX disc didn't want to
install an older version of the OS and several tries later, it finally
accepted a reinstall onto the secondary drive. I went online and updated
it to 10.4.11 along with other files Apple included and thought I was
nearing completion. When I next tried to install the OS disc on the
primary drive, using Erase &amp; Install, then trying Update several times,
the machine kept blowing out the install after almost completing the
process. (I let it check the install disc for errors just to make sure
the disc wasn't faulty.) The install OSX disc puts up a message to the
effect of 'try the installation again' with a &quot;Restart&quot; button flashing
on &amp; off. Just to check things out, I ran a &quot;Command - V&quot; request at
startup and found a message of the &quot;ATI Rage ndrv old&quot; and said it
'referred to the registry for updating'. Also, a &quot;Apple PMU::PMU forced
shutdown, cause= -122&quot; was revealed...So, after checking the meaning of
this error message through Apple's online support, it looks like the
power supply MAY be starting to fail. Is it feasible that small voltage
fluctuations could cause OSX system instabilities?...Are there any more
tests I can do to check the power supply? I was hoping to reinstall the
OS and upgrade to a faster machine. Any help would greatly appreciated.
TIA!   
 
Terry
