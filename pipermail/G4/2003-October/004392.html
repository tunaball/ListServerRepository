Apple has admitted that, just before Steve Jobs came back, they were down to
*one month's* worth of cash.

Not the way a multinational, billion dollar company is supposed to operate.

The 5300 was one of the worse machines Apple ever put out. Apple had to
extend the warranty on those machines to *7* years in order to fix the
screw-up. They have also been offering a buy back program every now and
then, trying to get them off the streets.
