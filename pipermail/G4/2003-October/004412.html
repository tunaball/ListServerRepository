Oh my!  Don't scare the people!  ;-)

My USD0.02: (for anyone thinking about jumping into Cocoa development) 
Don't think that just because the Apple-supplied development tools are 
free, that they are somehow far inferior to expensive commercial ones.  
Quite the contrary.  I started with them somewhere around NeXT 0.9 and 
continue to love them.  What's coming in Panther is even better (now 
that it's announced, I suppose it's less of an NDA violation to say 
that it's tres cool).

Also, if you want to start doing some Cocoa, the first book you should 
buy is &quot;Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X&quot; by Aaron Hillegass.   Also, a 
fairly decent Objective-C &quot;book&quot; is included with the dev tools in pdf 
form.  That's really all you need to get started.

Cocoa is a very clean and straightforward development environment.  I 
encourage anyone with even the slightest interest to check it out.

Time is a great teacher, but unfortunately it kills all its pupils.
