<PRE>I haven't followed the whole thread, but I'll chime in here.

You're right, Jim. If Classic isn't running it can't affect OS X.
On the other end though if you fiddled with the Energy Saver settings in 
OS 9 or Classic it can affect OS X, because those settings are saved in 
PRAM. But a PRAM zap erases that.

Yes that could be the case.

Don't know what version of OS X you're using, but if you're running a 
recent version of Jaguar it could be that you don't need a driver at all 
for this card. And if you installed an older driver, f.e. I see this 
driver at <A HREF="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/9369,">http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/9369,</A> that 
that causes the probem. I have a B&amp;W G3 with a 2930 SCSI card and I've 
never installed a driver for it and it works fine with my Jaz drive (OS 
X 10.2.8 BTW).

&gt;<i> I guess I could test this by plugging the card into a machine that's never
</I>&gt;<i> seen it before and see if the card all by itself prevents sleep.
</I>
Yep that would be a good way to test it.
