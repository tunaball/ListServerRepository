     On a MDD dual 1.0 GHz G4, I'm (as I write) running Eudora 6, 
Terminal (one window, to run top [see below]), Safari, Vicomsoft's 
Internet Gateway, iCal, Word, and a couple of startup apps (e.g. 
Default Folder X). According to the command-line app top, 659 Mbyte 
of the 1.25 Gbyte of memory installed is in use. I sometimes run much 
more memory-intensive stuff (large Photoshop files, scientific 
computing/display), so the &gt; 1 Gbyte is not a luxury.

     What more memory gives you is one of the key features of OS X (or 
any true multitasking OS): the ability to run lots of stuff at the 
same time, fast. The San Jose Mercury News had a recent article,

	<A HREF="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/6970136.htm">http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/6970136.htm</A> ,

about the G5 that reported how they were able to up-res a ~ 100 Mbyte 
Photoshop image to 1.6 Gbyte in three minutes at the same time they 
were ripping a CD in iTunes and watching a DVD at full-screen res. 
CPU speed, multithreading, look-ahead, datapath width, &amp;c. all help, 
but they couldn't have done it without a lot of physical memory. 
Absent that, and the system starts wasting gobs of time using the 
hard drives for virtual memory.

     So the answer to, &quot;How much is enough?&quot; depends critically on 
what you do with the machine.

     Your mileage will certainly vary,
