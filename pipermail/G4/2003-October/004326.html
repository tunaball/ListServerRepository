<PRE>It's not snoring, it has better manners than that.

It is trying to tell you that it has a loose cone and should be replaced 
before the buzzing is a continuous noise. Contact your local dealer for a 
replacement speaker.

It is easy to install yourself and you should not have to pay for a 
technician's time to do it. You only have to unclip the tab on the speaker housing to 
get it loose from the inside of the front panel. The locking tab is on the end 
of the speaker housing nearest the motherboard and there is a locater tab on 
the other end. Gently push the locking tab toward the speaker until that end  
comes loose. Once the speaker housing is loose, pull it toward you about an 
inch to remove the locater tab from the slot on the front panel.

The speaker wire is threaded under the drive mounting sled and plugs into the 
motherboard right next to the Airport card socket.Remove the sled and put the 
wire in the same location as the original wire. Plug the speaker wire into 
the motherboard and start your computer. You should hear no buzzing at all from 
a good speaker (unless you are playing a flight simulator which is noisy by 
itself).

Congratulations! You are on your way to becoming a Macintosh Service 
Technician.
