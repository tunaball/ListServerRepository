Hi Jay,

That's almost the same as how I set up my network :-)
T1 line connected to E-Tech ADSL modem/router/WAP/4 port switch --&gt; 
Amigo (aka E-Tech) 8 port switch --&gt; several PCs and Macs and one Cat5 
cable to another E-Tech 5 port switch to the living room downstairs.

Now on topic I use the WAP for my clamshell iBook. It has an Airport 
card installed, even works with the beta of Panther. You can also buy an 
Orinoco Gold or Silver card for a PC  if you're going to use an Apple 
laptop, it works with the Airport set up utility in OS 9. For OS X you 
need an open source driver.

For the rest I agree with JJ and Sandor. Definitely a router. I don't 
know if the E-Tech brand is available over there, but I really recommend 
it. I wanted to buy the Linksys 802.11b or g equivalent first because 
that's what the most Mac people recommend, but I got a good price on the 
E-Tech.

Didn't know that the 'Linksys &quot;wireless G&quot; PCI card adapter' works with 
the Mac, which OS are you using Sandor?
Is this the WMP54G (URL below)?

For networking them together you don't need software at all if you're 
running Jaguar, because the SAMBA protocol is built-in to connect to PCs.
You indeed need Dave software if you're running OS 9.x.
BTW if you're running OS X 10.1 I believe you also need Dave.
Isn't there an option in NT which can emulate AppleShare?
IIRC we used that option several years ago when we had an NT server here 
at work (the damn thing crashed several times a day, arrgh....)

Also Proxim formerly Farallon makes b/g Wifi hardware and they seem to 
support the Mac aswell.
