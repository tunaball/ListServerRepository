<PRE>I am having problems with getting on the web in OS 10.1.5. I am using 
SBCYahoo DSL on my G4 Quicksilver 733. I installed Norton Personal 
Firewall, though not at first when I began using DSl. After it was 
installed, I found that I couldn't seem to disconnect. Every time I 
disconnected, it would re-connect. I couldn't get my browser to 
connect to anything, no matter how I configured the firewall. I 
finally wiped the volume and re-installed from the ground up. I was 
able to download all updates from Apple, but after that, I was back 
to square one. As soon as I get connected, the connection log starts 
going wild and showing a bunch of people pinging me, but shows access 
denied. However, my modem light and the control panel still shows 
intermittent activity. I still can't get a browser to open a site, or 
connect to the Apple Software Update site. I suspect there is a virus 
of some sort in the volume. I scanned it from OS 9.2.2 with Norton 
Anti Virus with the latest update, but found nothing. I really can't 
afford to buy NAV for OSX, but I will if I can be sure that will fix 
the problem. Can anybody help me on this. I'd really appreciate it. 
Kind of like to get back to the web on OSX.

Thanks
Fred
