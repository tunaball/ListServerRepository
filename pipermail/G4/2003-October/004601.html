Finicky is an understatement! I did a recent clean install of Jag 
knowing I was going to upgrade to Panther. So the intended disk was 
squeaky clean with nothing added. I did an archive and install. 
During the end of the first disk install I got a message saying there 
was and error and to try again. I tried again and it I got a message 
saying there was no current system folder on which to install. I 
tried again with no joy. I called Apple. I had to re-install Jag and 
start the process all over. I am using Panther now but I am just 
waiting for something to go wrong. At the end of the first install 
disk I got the shade that comes down the computer screen with a 
message to restart. I am having what seems to be all of the 
complaints I have read on mac lists.

Not a happy Panther user as of yet.
