Hopefully I'm not giving too much away, but Xcode *is* different enough 
so that if you followed the &quot;click this button then click that button&quot; 
instructions in a tutorial written for the prior versions, you'd have 
some trouble.  Changes to the GUI layout tool, Interface Builder, 
aren't as extreme.

[totally lame analogy]  Think of Xcode as being a word processor.  
Apple has all but replaced the prior word processor with a new one with 
tons of cool new features.  The text you type in is the same, it's just 
done in a different word processor.

The good news is that there haven't been any radical changes to the 
Cocoa environment itself.  The frameworks have been extended a bit, and 
in some exciting ways, but it's totally backwards compatible with 
code/projects from the prior releases.

I'm not sure when Hillegass will update his book for Panther/Xcode.  
Since the dev tools are tied to specific OS X releases (i.e. you can't 
load Xcode on Jaguar or load the Jaguar tools on Panther (I think)) one 
could set up a dual-boot environment with an external firewire drive 
with Jaguar on it if you wanted to do your learning on Jaguar but use 
Panther for &quot;normal&quot; usage.  Or just buy another G5!   (which is how I 
work.  I have a dedicated Mac to do development on - keeps things 
cleaner that way)

Since David asked for opinions, mine would be to learn Cocoa on Jaguar 
and once you feel comfortable move up to Panther/Xcode.  Today, there 
are significantly more and better resources available for Jaguar than 
Panther.  That, coupled with the fact that it's highly unlikely that 
you'd need any of the new stuff anyways, makes Jaguar the better 
learning environment.  IMHO.  A year from now, it'll be different.

Hope that helps.

Go learn Cocoa!  It rocks!
