<PRE>Have no fear! It's not a virus. (Speaking of which...has anyone ever 
seen a virus for OSX?) Your firewall is probably configured 
incorrectly. I also have SBC Yahoo! DSL. Depending on the modem you got 
with your package, (mine was the Speed Stream 5360) you have to open 
certain ports on your machine. The modem they include is kind of a 
mini-router. The modem gets an IP address from SBC and then it assigns 
another IP to you. Check in your Network preferences, if you look at 
the IP address and it says &quot;Self Assigned&quot; it means your modem couldn't 
connect to your Mac. So your Mac for the sake of it, assigns it's own 
IP address to itself. Try disabling your Norton firewall first to see 
if that works. If it does then call up SBC and check which ports you 
need to open on your firewall, they should be able to guide you through 
it. If not, check your Network preferences tab once again, it should be 
set to DCHP. If not, set it to use DCHP. SBC should be able to guide 
you through everything necessary to set it up correctly.

Let me know how this works,
CJ
