<PRE>Hi,
I am going to partition the 160 gig drive on my G4 and could use some help too.
I boot into 9.2.6 most of the time and feel like X residue is in there even though
I am booted into 9.  Is this my imagination? I really only like booting into X for
intensive apps.

I thought I'd do 3 partitions as well.
One for 9.2.6, one for X and one with X and 9.2.6, that will also be a backup.
I was going to split it 40, 60, 50 approx.
I was wondering if - for my 9.2 partition - I should downgrade to 9.2.2?

Actually, if I could get my external 80 gig ACOM to boot my new G4, I would only
need 2 partions, but it won't boot my G4. I can't figure out why.
I had heard that only the modified 9.2.6 that came on the G4 would boot it - so I
put the same OS 9.2.6 that is on my G4 on the external. But - no go.

It used to boot my G3 just fine. Any ideas about this. The drive is only one year
old so it should even be X bootable, shouldn't it? However, I would like it to
boot in 9.
I can't find any suport from Acom regarding this, nor could I find anything on the
internet about it.

At any rate, I would appreciate suggestions and advice on partition sizes, and any
tips you may have.
Thank you, C.C.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I recently bought an Imac 17&quot; 1GIG Super drive. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manual didn't seem to offer full info. on the correct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ram. If anyone could fill in the specifics, I would

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complete error. Anyone know if their still in biz?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also I would like to partition the HD(80GIG) to handle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the pre X apps. I have. I remember a thread awhile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back about three separate partitions; 1 for X 1 for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stand alone 9.2.2 for Classic and 1 for 9.2.2 and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assorted apps. etc. I am looking for guidance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regarding how to perform the partition and if there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any difference which partition goes where. My thoughts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are the 9.2+ apps would be around 5 Gigs the classic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; partition around 1 Gig and the rest for X.
