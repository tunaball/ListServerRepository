<PRE>A great scanner for about $79.99  is the Canon CanoScan LiDE 30. Check  
it out.

<A HREF="http://www.usa.canon.com/html/">http://www.usa.canon.com/html/</A> 
conCprProductDetail.jsp?modelid=6623&amp;item=6633&amp;section=10217

Usb Bus powered and features an attachable vertical stand. The vertical  
stand is a very useful space saving feature, especially for me. I use  
my scanner occasionally so having it taking up my desk all the time is  
not practical ,because I end using it as a shelf. So having it vertical  
next to the monitor or even behind a flat panel gets it out of the way.  
Plus with scanning sheets of paper the scanner does not need to lay  
flat(that is really need for scanning other objects like books).  The  
only thing bad about the scanner is that it is a little slow at  
previewing and Scanning, but if you use if occasionally it is really  
not a problem.

P.S. Don't buy a HP or a UMAX.

HP--- What do they make that works right the first time? I bought a  hp  
scanjet 3500c before the Canon. Brought it home and it did not work,  
then i took it back to CompUsa. Then the Apple rep there took out a  
another of the 3500c scanners and it also did not work on os X. So that  
is not a good user experience(Did Hp test this to make sure there stuff  
worked?) and also there support web page is plain confusing. The manual  
that came with the scanner was a different model,&quot;Very Helpful.&quot;  (Note  
that the 3500c is now discontinued so they might have it right the  
second time, but that is chance you will take with HP. I hope you are  
close to the store incase of a return.)

UMAX -- Was a good company... I use to have an old SCSI Astra 1200S  
worked well under os 9. Now its gone simply because of no 10 driver  
support and SCSI card driver problems. They don't support Mac os X (But  
they say they will in the future if you buy a Pro scanner Starting at  
399.00, but I would not believe anything they say) Consumers scanners  
the affordable ones are out of luck according to their support page.  
Their solution is restart into mac os 9.1 to scan...
