<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Remember when Apple didn't charge for a .x upgrade?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You mean, back in the day when Apple was going broke and couldn't pay for
</I>&gt;<i> it's own R&amp;D? When the &quot;cutting edge&quot; was the Performa series? And laptops
</I>&gt;<i> were being recalled or flat out were pieces of crap that didn't work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah...I remember....

I don't remember, but was this when Apple was &quot;on its last legs&quot; in the mid nineties, or was this when they were &quot;going out of business&quot; in the early nineties?

I don't seem to recall paying for 9.1 or 9.2, and I wouldn't call the Powerbooks then pieces of crap.
