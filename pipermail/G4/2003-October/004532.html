<PRE>Not all Macs play well with &quot;Cable Select&quot; settings even though many people 
will say that they will IF the Mac is a newer machine. Older models, and the 
occasional new one too, refuse to accept CS bridge settings and will not allow 
the drive to mount until the setting is changed to Master or Slave.

Additionally, some Macs will refuse to recognize a drive set to CS if there 
is a second drive also set to CS on the same bus ribbon. In that case, try 
setting the drives to Master and Slave and install them on the IDE bus ribbon with 
the Master drive closest to the mother board.

Another stumbling block is whether the drives are attached to separate IDE 
bus ribbons and there is another device (CD, Zip, Imation, etc) on the ribbon 
with the drive. Frequently, the speed of the drive is reduced because of the 
slower device being attached to the ribbon. I always set up the drives on one 
ribbon and the other devices on their own ribbon to avoid possible slow-downs.

HTH.
