&gt;<i> Ron,

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the response.  Maybe I should have stated the problem,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a friend who has an e-Mac (75gig, 256Megbyte, OSX3.2 - just 
</I>&gt;<i> updated to Tiger).  She can't get on the net from her machine with a 
</I>&gt;<i> phone modem. It had been working and than all of sudden she couldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> on the net.  Her computer seems to connect with her provider ( it 
</I>&gt;<i> states &quot;connecting&quot; and after a few minutes it says &quot; connected&quot;). 
</I>&gt;<i> However once connected, neither Outlook or Safari work.  Outlook just 
</I>&gt;<i> grinds away doing nothing and Safari within a few seconds comes back 
</I>&gt;<i> with a message that indicates it can't establish a connection -- even 
</I>&gt;<i> though there is a connection to the provider. It appears like it is 
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for a password, but never asks for anything!  I thought it 
</I>&gt;<i> sounded like a virus.  One tech thought that there could be some Spy 
</I>&gt;<i> Ware running, redirecting the efforts of the CPU???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So there is the problem!  Now perhaps you guys might have a solution?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not so sure that you really need an anti-virus program. Are you

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can affect OS-X even though Virex keeps putting out updates to their 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> program.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know that someone will say that you should have an anti-virus 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> program to prevent forwarding a PC virus that you may have gotten 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from a document that you received from another PC user, but that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't appear to me to be such a problem. If they insist on using a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine that is vulnerable to so much mal-ware, aren't they simply 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asking for trouble? According to statements I have read, there are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over 97,000 examples of viruses (virii?), trojan horses, macros, etc, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that affect PCs and about 68 that affect Macs. With that condition, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why worry about you giving something to a PC user when he is more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> likely to get it all on his own simply by using his machine on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internet?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An experiment was done at a university in California with 8 brand new 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PCs right out of the boxes. They were plugged in, turned on, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configured for internet access. They had software installed that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would sound an alert when any attempt was made to access them from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the outside world. Operators sat down and started surfing the net, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going to different sites so there wouldn't be any duplication of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visits. Within 48 minutes, all 8 had sounded the alert.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> None of the machines were Macs, so the result from the experiment 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably cannot be used with any degree of certainty. But---it does 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point out that PCs are not safe at all, even when they are brand new.

Perhaps you might want to open up &quot;Activity Monitor: and see which 
process are using the most CPU time and percentage. There might be some 
clue as to what is happening
