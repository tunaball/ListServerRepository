<PRE>Could have been a file corruption, I had one somewhere when Tiger  
installed for the first time. Again, after installing the computer  
would have a kernel panic on every restart or shutdown. The solution  
was to do a Archive and Install over the existing 10.4 tiger  
installation, that fixed it rather painlessly. The traditional  
hardware method limited the problem down to the Apple usb keyboard..  
Oddly enough most of the time the computer would not panic if the  
keyboard was substituted for the original mini G4 / imac keyboard.  
So, something was messed up there, but it is all fixed now minus the  
DVD player issue. Note that prior to this I was running on a upgraded  
system folder that had been around problem free since Mac os 10.0.   
Considering the changes made since then it is not out of the question  
for something like that to happen over that much time.
