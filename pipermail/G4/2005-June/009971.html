<PRE>I took the time to watch the keynote address all the way through. Okay, 
I half &quot;watched&quot; it -- the other half I listened to while I made myself 
supper.

 From what I got out of this speech, there's nothing much to worry about 
(if everything goes according to plan), since the software many of us 
are using today in OS X will work seamlessly on newer machines (with 
the aid of a nifty piece of background software called Rosetta that we 
won't even know is working). Jobs proved this point by running his 
entire presentation on an Intel-based Mac and called up a number of 
programs to prove they would work Just Fine (all the regular Apple 
stuff (Mail, Safari, blah blah blah..., plus Word, Excel, and 
Photoshop).

It's simply up to Developers now to get on the ball and tweak their 
apps so they'll be usable on the next wave of Intel-based Macs (as well 
as on existing machines).

I suppose the notion of &quot;buying all new software&quot; in a couple years is 
a matter of how you look at things. If you buy an Intel-based Mac when 
they come out, your existing software may work on it, but won't you 
eventually want to upgrade to the software versions that work best on 
your newer machine and offer you the latest features? (Note I said 
&quot;upgrade&quot;, not &quot;buy new&quot;.)

Heck, in two years you may well want to upgrade from the versions you 
are running now anyway, for any number of reasons -- never mind the 
whole Intel-based Mac issue.
