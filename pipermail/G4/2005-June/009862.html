Setting up your PM G4 describes it well

states that if you want more than two HDs, you'll need a SCSI PCI card, 
etc.

IMHO- I believe that this information is not exactly what he needed to 
see. This page of the article only addresses the matter of installing 
SCSI drives in the G4, and says nothing about using additional IDE 
drives.

If you have extra SCSI drives just laying around the house, by all 
means, use them if they are large enough to fit your need. However, 
larger capacity IDE drives are much cheaper than SCSI drives and can be 
installed by using a PCI card like the Sonnet ATA-133 IDE controller 
card. This card will recognize more than the 120Gb limit of each drive 
that is the default limit for the stock controller.

If the two ribbon kit is purchased with the card, each ribbon will 
accommodate two drives. That way, four hard drives might be installed 
in the G4 instead of only the two that the article page indicates. This 
ability to mount four hard drives is dependent on the total power 
requirements of the drives installed in the case. Be sure not to exceed 
the capability of the power supply and be sure to count each separate 
drive, including the CD and Zip drives. I was only able to mount three 
hard drives in my box because of a power limitation but I was still 
able to install over 240Gb worth of drives on the card.

Hope this gives extra information and guidance.
