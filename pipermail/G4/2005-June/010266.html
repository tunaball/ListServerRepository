(1) The statement quoted by Paul is wrong. With physical access, it is 
perfectly possible to install anything without any password. All you 
have to do is boot the Mac from a CD (which even a novice can make with 
BootCD) or a FireWire drive. It's more difficult if the Open Firmware 
password is enabled, but even that can be bypassed. Basically, if 
someone has physical access to a Mac, you can consider the machine 
compromised.

(2) The notion that spyware or malware can only be installed &quot;from the 
CD&quot; is wrong. The most serious Mac malware so far is Renepo, and it can 
install itself over the LAN. Moreover, it is possible to install 
malware without a password, by piggy-backing on sudo (this is a feature 
common to all Unix systems). Moreover, the Zaptastic exploit has shown 
that, in Tiger, is possible to install malware without a password and 
even without the user being aware.

Having said that, the threat on the Mac is minimal. With a few basic 
steps (such as unchecking the &quot;Open safe files&quot; option), you can be 
reasonably secure -- the stress being on &quot;reasonably&quot;.

Finally, there is a common misperception about malware. As soon as 
something goes wrong, many users immediately think, &quot;I have a virus!&quot;. 
In fact, even on Win, a bug or configuration problem is much more 
likely than a virus. On Mac, at this point, having a virus or malware 
is like being hit by a meteorite on the head -- it's not impossible, 
but the likelihood is not worth talking about.
