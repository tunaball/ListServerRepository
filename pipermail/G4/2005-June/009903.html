As a high school student I attended a Methodist church and was dating the preacher's daughter. With a small group of students the Rev. cracked an egg into a beaker of alcohol and it immediately congealed. It &quot;proved&quot; that alcohol was bad for you.

I was allowed time to demonstrate the same effect when I replaced the alcohol with Coca Cola. My point was missed by all believers but I did continue to see the young lady.

Sodium bicarbonate and carbonic acid (baking soda) are well known as cleaning agents. They are regularly touted in newspaper columns - Heloise.  The test is in the residue. Sugar is terrible, donno about caffeine. Diet Coke? Uric acid is also a good cleaner but I really don't think aiming at a keyboard is a good idea. Save it for putting out the campfire.

Don't forger WD-40. The WD probably stands for &quot;water displacement&quot;. I have used it on sticky switches with much success. It's not a lubricant but it does move existing grease around with a rejuvenation effect. It seems to be OK for use on electronic plastics.
