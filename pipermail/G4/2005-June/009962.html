My wife always tells me to talk like this. She is a therapist. The language
suits her. I&#185;m with Kunga, get to the point, don&#185;t mince words. Show some
emotion rather than a non-offensive/non-inspiring/non-anything inter-office
memo style. I understood ya, Kunga, mate! :)

As to Apple/Intel I say go for it, Steve. Apple has suffered from the
insular &#140;I gotta be different just to be different even when it hurts&#185;
attitude. I want Apple to be around for a long time. Since Steve has been
back on the job he&#185;s firstly stabilised the company with new product and is
now taking the fight directly to Windows and divesting the shackles of a &#140;we
make computers company&#185;. He has turned into what it started as &#173; an
innovative technology company that does things differently.

 To establish an architecture that opens the possibility of down the track
selling an OS that might operate on PC&#185;s and be sold to PC users will
finally give Bill Gates some real competition. Like wise if it becomes
possible to install Windows products on my machines will mean I won&#185;t have
to suffer the situation of being denied use of some great programs like
Swish (and there are many of them).

Big companies tend not to do things &#140;for us&#185; but lets hope that a truly
universal usage of the hardware might happen at some stage. I&#185;m likely to
always have macs ( I like to have a machine that I can fall in love with)
but there are lots of reasons to switch to Intel and most of them are good.

Tony
