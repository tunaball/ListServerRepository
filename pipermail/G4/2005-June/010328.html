<PRE>I think the reason Richard's system would not load the software (or 
prompted him not to do so) was that they were identical versions and 
hence &quot;not newer&quot;.

As for dates, I am not too sure about the date integrity of files (that 
is I am not sure that the dates are preserved all the time...though 
perhaps sometimes they are in Tom's case).

The there are two dates: create date and modified date.  I have seen my 
file dates look strange and compared on two systems it looks more like 
when the files were created on this volume than when they were actually 
built and put in the install package.  Anyone care to speculate?

Bottom line, I would use version numbers to track what files you have 
and not pay much attention to dates.

Tom - you have an old version of DVD Player if you still have 4.5 on 
Tiger, you should do the upgrade.  And if you have an ATI 8500 (like 
me) then you might have some compatibility problems with the video 
subsystem.  I am standing down to remain on Panther which works ok 
(save that 10.3.8 seems to have corrupted the video drivers too but 
just causes chop I didn't see in 10.3.5 where I plan to revert to this 
weekend).  Plus the 8500 isn't able to take advantage of the new video 
system in Tiger - so two strikes there for me.

Richard - you are up to date as you can be for now.
