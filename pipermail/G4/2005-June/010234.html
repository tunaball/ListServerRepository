<PRE>Ron,

Thanks for the response.  Maybe I should have stated the problem, 
rather  my guess at the solution.

I have a friend who has an e-Mac (75gig, 256Megbyte, OSX3.2 - just 
updated to Tiger).  She can't get on the net from her machine with a 
phone modem. It had been working and than all of sudden she couldn't on 
the net.  Her computer seems to connect with her provider ( it states 
&quot;connecting&quot; and after a few minutes it says &quot; connected&quot;). However 
once connected, neither Outlook or Safari work.  Outlook just grinds 
away doing nothing and Safari within a few seconds comes back with a 
message that indicates it can't establish a connection -- even though 
there is a connection to the provider. It appears like it is waiting 
for a password, but never asks for anything!  I thought it sounded like 
a virus.  One tech thought that there could be some Spy Ware running, 
redirecting the efforts of the CPU???

So there is the problem!  Now perhaps you guys might have a solution?
