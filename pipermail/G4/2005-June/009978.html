<PRE>Macintosh computers' motherboards and OS X are intimately  
interrelated and will continue to have NOTHING to do with intel/amd  
motherboards made to work with Windows and Linux.

There was an explicit explanation by Steve that OS X has ALWAYS been  
processor independent since day one and will continue to be. This  
plan is specifically about processors in two years not in the past  
and now. The RISC vs CISC &quot;argument&quot; still applies. I am completely  
delighted I just bought a NEW dual 2.5 G5 PPC Mac for $1999 Saturday  
at Fry's. I even love the fact it is the world's first liquid cooled  
processor system.

AMD might get involved when Apple &amp; Intel can't keep up with demand.
