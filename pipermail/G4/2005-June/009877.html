So, Ron, you say that the developers should standardize on Windows OS 
and ignore  the pesky, miniscule Mac market that seems to do nothing 
but complain? ;)

No. what I do suggest is that is appears to me that fewer and fewer 
developers are creating hybrid programs because they see more of a 
profit in the WhineDoze area and that is what their bottom line is all 
about. It seems that I do not find hybrid programs as frequently as in 
the past and that support for Mac owners is dropping despite the ease, 
stability, and performance of the Mac when compared fairly with 
equivalent PC boxes.

I feel that Apple has dropped the ball big time when it comes to their 
advertising program. There are dozens of PC ads on the tube and in 
magazines and newspapers, but mighty few Apple ads. Even when Apple 
does buy some advertising space, their ads hardly ever speak about the 
abilities of the machines, but they do frequently show the iPod and 
music with dancing figures.

It isn't about how you listen to music, but about how easy it is to 
keep your computer running smoothly and free from viruses (virii?) and 
spyware and how much more productive a Mac can be. This feature (word 
borrowed without sincerity from MS advertising) is hardly ever 
mentioned by Apple in ads.

End of rant.
