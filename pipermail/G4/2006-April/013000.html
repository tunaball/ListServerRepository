This doesn't make any sense. The upgrade will be in no way be  
&quot;wasted&quot;. PC133 is backwards compatible with PC100 and is often less  
expensive than PC100 these days. In that case it is the sensible  
choice and you will get the full benefit of the memory increase.


&gt;<i> The actual location (which slot?) hasn't seemed to make much

As I said in my most recent post the manual for this machine says  
that memory can be installed in any order. Also, while the manual  
doesn't explicitly say this, machines of this generation do not  
benefit from installing matched pairs of memory.


&gt;<i> Just remember to not mix speeds when the specs call for matching  
</I>&gt;<i> speeds. A mix will cause a slow-down that most of us won't see with  
</I>&gt;<i> our eyes but which will show up during operations like image  
</I>&gt;<i> rendering. Of course, that only really applies if speed is crucial  
</I>&gt;<i> to your productivity or you are a serious gamer.
</I>
This is incorrect. There will be no &quot;slow-down&quot;. A Yikes can only  
operate memory at PC100 speeds. A Yikes, using PC133, will still run  
at the same speed as it would with PC100 memory. While there are  
computers that will run with mixed memory speeds, but that will run  
imperceptibly faster if only the faster memory is used the Yikes is  
not one of them.
