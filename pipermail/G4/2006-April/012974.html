<PRE>kind of ironic,

So yes, we are sentimental about boxes and old computers.

I have the Style-Writer box too with books in it..

I also had a Apple Multiple Scan 15 Display box as well , that i  
threw away about a year ago, the display broke 5 years before that. I  
also have a Performa 6214cd box and the computer still in it, that  
&quot;blunder&quot; of a computer   still works, and probably will never break,  
it is amazing that it worked in the first place. It is a Mickey  
Moused&#8482; computer system, with parts of old an old Quadra 68040 tossed  
in a box with a PPC chip,  need i say more. If  you want to know more  
look at lowendmac.com article on the system.

But what do do with something like that....

it is pretty much useless for anything but typing text....

internet is out of the question with page load times up to 40 seconds  
per page with broadband....

Even linux will not run on this system, since the last time i check a  
few years ago....

But still i have it sitting around in the box in a  spare room with  
other boxes and don't want to get rid of it for some reason, i guess  
as a symbol of how computers should not be made, or how much money  
was spent on it.

But moving from that to a G4 was a world of a difference, and it  
looks like the move to a G5 or even Intel will be just as impressive  
if not more....

Anyway keep the box and the system together, so when some day when it  
is sold for a $1 at a yard sale someone will get a history lesson on  
what buying computer was like in 1996 or whatever year, but in  
general you are better off selling the computer and box when it is  
still worth something on ebay, etc. I missed the boat on that one...

I wish I would have sold my 6214cd when it was still worth $200 on  
ebay in 1999-2000.
