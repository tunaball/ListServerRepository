The 80 wire cable that your drive's documentation mentions is the  
ribbon cable that would directly connect your drive to either the  
motherboard of your computer or the bridge board inside of your  
external case - not the Firewire cable that runs between the external  
case and your computer. Your external case already has such a cable -  
it's the very short ribbon cable which connects your drive to the  
bridge board inside of the case.

All of the IDE cables in your G4 DA are 80 wire cables. (Unless  
someone changed them.)

As to finding such a cable, you'd have to go out of your way  
(probably at a surplus store) to get anything other than such a cable  
these days.

Are you sure your media supports 16X? Does you drive have the latest  
firmware installed?
