<PRE>This message was bounced back saying that I wasn't a member. I'm not sure

maybe it was because I sent it from my work e-mail?

Original message:

Hello all,

I hope that someone may be able to help me with these problems.

I've been trying to install OS X 10.5 and CS3 on my G4 Digital Audio
(1.2GHZ/1GB RAM/ 120GB HD) and I'm experiencing some problems. Of
course I went
through the whole Photoshop Beta issue. I ended up having to run the &quot;clean
sweep&quot; script that Adobe put out and I think that it brought out an
underlying problem. I resolved the issue with the Beta version, but I
couldn't get CS3 to install properly and now my CS2 applications will
continually crash - even after un-installing CS3. Also, every time I try to
install 10.5 my system crashes. Since running the &quot;clean sweep&quot; script even
Flock randomly quits on me.

I ran Disk Warrior on my machine and it told me that it could not rebuild my
HD because the fragmentation was too severe. I booted from another HD and
ran the Apple Disk Utility on my regular HD and it &quot;repaired&quot; the drive. I
tried to run Disk Warrior again to &quot;rebuild&quot; the drive, but it still said
that it was too fragmented still.

Does anyone know of any other problems that could be occurring other than
the fragmentation with the HD? Is my computer too old to run this software?
Did the &quot;Clean Sweep&quot; throw away essential files?

Also, if I were to try to salvage my files on my fragmented HD by cloning
the drive to another, would the fragmentation clone as well? Or, could I
clone the drive to another, reformat the fragmented drive and re-clone it
back to the reformatted drive - or would I be re-cloning the fragmentation
back onto the reformatted drive? Hope I that made sense.

Any help would be much appreciated!
