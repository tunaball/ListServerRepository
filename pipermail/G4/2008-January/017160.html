<PRE>Brad

While first gen. G5 are great but still a bit costly. And the Mirror  
Door G4 is simply loud (if you don't get a fan upgrade with your  
purchase)... I would look for a max out Quicksilver (2002) with a  
dual 1 GB processor and 1.5 GB of memory. That what I did and  it  
fill my needs for now and runs my small rep firm as well. And yes, I  
using OS X 10.5.2 (Leopard) Mine cost me $260.00 and and shortly  
there after I sold my QS 733 MH for $200.00... for a difference of  
$60.00. via ebay. Granted I was lucky but one should be able to close  
on a QS (2002) for under $450 easily.

By the way be sure to get a QS 2002... because the QS 2002 do not  
have a limit on the size of hard drives attached and had a faster  
processor chip and in general a better unit to work with and easier  
to upgrade and build-out. I've max out everything I can on this  
model, include a 750GB second hard drive with firewire  as a backup  
device.

Bottom line - the QS 2002 has a good cost value and still handles  
Leopard!

Good luck and good hunting!

Sorry I'm not being clear.  Simply scrolling in the inbox window is  
sluggish.  But scrolling in the reading pane is fine.

Also,
Thanks for everyone's advice!  I think I'm convinced not to upgrade  
the old gigabit machine but buy a newer machine.  Any advice on which  
one?  I'm wondering if I shouldn't look to a first gen G5 or if a  
Mirror Door one will do the trick.  Again, I'm just trying to use  
Yahoo webmail, surf, use the newest iPhoto,MS Office, handle Leopard  
and hopefully one more OS generation.  Any advice on a machine that  
would do that reasonably well?

Thanks!

Brad
