<PRE>Kevin:

You are asking all the right questions and you can have a lot of fun, 
like in finding a new hobby to play with.  But before spending any 
money, please take a look at the specs and cost of a brand new Apple 
Mac-Mini, or even a refurbished one, or a used one.  To upgrade your 
tower, you can easily spend close to the cost of a new Mini.  You might 
want to set a dollar limit, say something like $200 or $300 for 
software and hardware.  For general info, look at

My thoughts to your specific questions below.

</I>
&gt;<i> This past summer, I acquired a G4 tower from a windows

</I>
&gt;<i>   The ATA drive is

Good for 10.4.  For 10.5, better to have at least 1 GB.  $50 - $100.
&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> have been supplementing the lack of hard drive space
</I>&gt;<i> with an external firewire drive.  I'm about to tack
</I>&gt;<i> the major necessary steps to enhance the computer's
</I>&gt;<i> performance and would like some feedback for any of
</I>&gt;<i> you experts.  Below are the upgrades I'm looking into
</I>&gt;<i> and i would like to know &quot;could I&quot;, &quot;should I&quot;, and if
</I>&gt;<i> so &quot;how do I&quot; on each issue.  First the specs: Power
</I>&gt;<i> Mac G4, AGP Graphics (Sawtooth, I think) / 1 CPU,
</I>&gt;<i> type: 2.9, 400 MHz / firmware 4.2.8f1 / AGP: Rage
</I>&gt;<i> 128Pro / OS X 10.3.9
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> New internal ATA drive - I think something around 40
</I>&gt;<i> gigs is adequate for me.  I'm considering keeping the
</I>&gt;<i> 10 GB drive in there (why not) but loading the OS on
</I>&gt;<i> the new larger drive.
</I>
Any new drive is likely to give you more.  $70?  But if you say that 40 
GB is enough, that suggests you do not have a lot of video or music 
processing to do, which further suggests that running 10.4 might be a 
reasonable target.  Why go for 10.5 on this old machine?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second Processor - is it possible to add another
</I>&gt;<i> rather than replacing it, what could work?
</I>
Second processor will not go on the existing motherboard.  Replacing 
processor has options.  Look at various vendors, including OWC.  Maybe 
$100 - $200.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> New video card - or is the one in there fine?
</I>
There are a couple features in OS 10.4 and 10.5 which will not work 
with the old card.  But not critical for most people.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OS upgrade - with the proper upgrades, could 10.4 or
</I>&gt;<i> even 10.5 be installed?
</I>
10.4 will be happy.  I don't know if you can bump that machine up to 
the minimum requirements for 10.5.  With a hack or two, you can run 
10.5 below Apple's &quot;minimum requirements.&quot;  Oh, Another $50 or $80 here 
too.
