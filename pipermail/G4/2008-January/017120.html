<PRE>This is a list for people who use G4 systems. Consider us Luddites if
you wish but I for one have no need of a $3000 8-core speed demon for the
things I do. Plus I've done a lot of work with Classic apps over the years,
so I appreciate the ability to use Classic mode if I need it.

I recently upgraded my Power Mac G4 (Sawtooth) to make it Leopard-capable.
I didn't think it was particularly slow for tasks like email or web
browsing previously, but after adding RAM (up to 1.3 GB from 320 MB),
upgrading the CPU (only to a single 1.0 GHz) and adding a SATA drive,
it is noticeably snappier now.

According to lowendmac.com, people have reported that the performance
of Leopard on G4 systems is comparable to Tiger and I would agree with
that in my case. And according to at least one report there, everything
in Leopard works fine with an ATI Radeon 9200. Upgrading from the 500 GHz
CPU probably would be desirable, but Leopard could still be installed
with the workaround described here:
