You will need a serial ATA controller to use a serial ATA drive, and  
for your model of Mac, that will mean buying a PCI card. You would  
then install those drives internally and, if it is your wish, move  
your old parallel ATA drives into external enclosures that plug into  
Firewire or USB.

That system probably has room for 3 or 4 hard drives internally, so  
you wouldn't necessarily need to move any drives outside the case. I  
don't know of any external enclosures for serial ATA drives, and even  
if there were one, it would negate the speed benefit of serial ATA,  
since serial ATA operates much more quickly than Firewire or USB  
would permit.

Your serial ATA drives should be perfectly bootable once installed,  
and I'd certainly recommend doing just that. External drives are  
great for back-ups, in my humble opinion.
