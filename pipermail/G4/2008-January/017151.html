It's not the same and I never said it was.  Here is the original quote  
from YOUR post.

--------
The analogy: parallel ATA hose uses a wide, low
pressure pipe to fill a bucket, whereas serial ATA
uses a thin pipe but running at a very high pressure
to push the same, or more, water through in a given
time.

ATA133 = 133Mbytes per second.
SATA = 1.5Gbits per second.

I believe these two are comparable in throughput.
--------

As you can see, YOU said it was comparable and I was simply pointing  
out how confusing it is to compare Mbytes to Gbits when the truth of  
the matter is there is only 17 Mbytes difference between the two.  As  
far as how the industry refers to SATA drives I've never seen it  
expressed in Gbits.  Most use SATA (150) or SATA (300), which refers  
to 150 Mbytes per second or 300 Mbytes per second.  The HD industry  
has always had confusing labeling terms when it comes to selling their  
drives and have made a habit of expressing capacities in confusing  
terms.  I'm sure they will do everything they can to confuse us even  
further with the new interface terms and speeds.  I was just trying to  
show the difference in the two speeds (PATA vs. SATA) in simple terms  
and that was all I meant by it.  I was seeking to clarify, not  
criticize.

Just a simple message from Doug...
