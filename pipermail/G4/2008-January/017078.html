I have every simpathy Frank, but statements like this
always make me wonder. I think this is a topic that
could/should be explored by the computer industry.

I think there is a difference between how &quot;experts&quot;
and &quot;the industry&quot; define fast, and the experience of
the average user (in which I include myself). 

When you are at home, and surfing the web, and you
click on a link, you have to wait while the page
loads. Even if you have cable, sometimes that's the
slowest link. So it won't get any better with a newer,
faster 'puter, will it?

My main machine at home is a dual 450GHz G4 tower.
When my wife needed a new 'puter, I bought her an
Intel iMac. Admittedly this was to:

1) Stop her moaning about &quot;old&quot; computers.
3) We liked that form-factor.
2) It looks really cool!

But on the occasions that I've used it, it seems slow
or at least not significantly faster. Which is
surprising when you consider how much more &quot;powerful&quot;
the Intel cpu are claimed to be.

So I wonder if anybody has ever done a study of what
factors influence a users perception of how &quot;fast&quot; a
computer is? I wounder how significant are things
like:

1) How much cache ram and main ram?
2) Disk speed / type?
3) video card?
4) number and speed of cpu?

In my case the iMac is standard, but my G4 has 1Gb of
ram (twice the iMac's) and runs from a U160 SCSI disk
hung from a ATTO PCI controller. The G4 also has a
flashed eBay ATI RADEON 9200 video card.

I guess if you edit video or do intensive photoshop
work then your experience maybe different.
