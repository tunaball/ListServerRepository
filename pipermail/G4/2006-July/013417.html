<PRE>Tony,

&lt;RANT ON&gt;
I have one question to ask. In what way did you answer his question? I don't 
want to start any flame wars, but your answer was of ZERO help!

Not everyone (actually, a lot don't seem to, but tend to not speak up because 
of responses like yours) likes OSX. I've had 10.3.9 on both my QS and MDD for 
quite some time, and find myself going back to 9.2.2 for numerous reasons. 
I'm slowly moving to OSX, but I find X to be very confusing compared to OS9. I 
have a TON of software I use in OS9 that is paid for. Moving to X means 
spending money on new software to do that same job my paid for OS9 software does now. 
Finding drivers for SCSI stuff (scanners) that works in X isn't easy either. 
Over the years I have found ways to work around the few problems I have in OS9 
so that they don't impede me. Your statement that EVERYTHING is easier in OSX 
is a flat out lie. It MAY be easier for a lot of people, but not everybody. 
Some of us are tech support for our friends and relatives who will use OS9 
until they die, so we can't leave it behind even if we wanted to. I myself am 
slowly moving to OSX, but find it difficult and time consuming. However, I know 
it's the future and X will eventually be worth it.

So, let me say two things. If you don't have an answer to a question or 
useful help, SHUT UP! Get off the back of those who don't like or can't go to OSX, 
like SCSI instead of IDE/ATA, like OS9, or worse, like and use AOL, etc. We 
generally have good reasons for our decisions. If he can't find a solution for 
his problem in OS9, he'll probably move to X on his own.

This is not personal. You may have even meant well. Remember that some people 
don't have the option to move to X. Right now, OSX gives me no joy. OS9 does.
&lt;RANT OFF&gt;

&lt;&lt; Firstly, I cannot help with anything to do with OS 9 sorry, it is a bit too
ancient history, a horrible old OS that I wouldn't wish on anyone. It has
many problems including the fact that virtually all software now available
requires a minimum of OS 10.3.9  OS 9 users are in this bubble that is
slowly getting more isolated. I know, my wife is one of them, but she clings
to to the past, and thinks that her computing hassles are normal. They are
not.

If you have a G4 then why are you not going for OS X? You will find that
EVERYTHING including networking is easier. I have a LAN with a PC on it,
works fine.

Go for OS X. You don't have to have the latest, 10.3.x is fine if that's
easier to get hold of and it is easy to upgrade to !0.3.9. 10.4.x has the
advantage of the internal search function called Spotlight.

Who knows, with OS X you may even re-discover joy in computing. And have
everything that Windows Vista is promising, but have it now.
