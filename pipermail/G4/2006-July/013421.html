<PRE>Doug,

Actually, I did. As a long time Mac guy who has belonged to a number of Mac 
lists, I guess I have a different perspective than the converted PC guy, who 
knows nothing of the old rants some of us used to hear on some of the lists 
about how stupid us OS9 users were because we preferred OS9 over X, or weren't 
interested in moving to X. His first paragraph sounded just like one of those. I 
reacted to what I thought was another one. If long time Mac owners on the list 
think I over reacted, I apologize. I'm sorry.

The point I was trying to make, apparently unsuccessfully, was that you can 
suggest something without insulting or berating where the person is, what they 
use, prefer, etc.

He could have said, &quot;There may be a way to do it in OS9, but I don't know 
how. There are others on the list that might help you with OS9, but personally I 
think you'd save time by upgrading to OSX and using that instead. If you don't 
know OS9 and have to learn a new OS anyway, or don't have a lot of software 
invested in OS9, consider buying OSX. That's what He could have said. What I 
heard was, &quot;You idiot. Why are you using 9? Why aren't you using X?&quot;. 

By the way, did you notice there was an answer to the guys question?
&lt;There is a program called PC/MAC LAN it works great for networking  
Macs and PC's.

I used it for years on my Network, you install it on all PC's on the  
network and it connects to all the Macs.&gt;

Point well taken on the former PC guy front. I hadn't thought about the fact 
that there would be such a different perspective. I have heard that a number 
of people think it's an easier transition from Windows to OSX than from OS9.

Once again, I'm sorry.

Steve, as the one who agreed with Tony, I can only say you didn't read 
the original post very well.  He made it very clear he was a &quot;PC guy&quot;.  
So as a former &quot;PC guy&quot; myself, I can tell you that OS X makes what he 
wanted to do much, much easier and the hoops that are required for OS 9 
to be useful on a PC network are too much of a hassle to fool with when 
you could use OS X and have the connectivity that you desire for much 
less work.  From your lack of a helpful response I can see you don't 
know of an easier way to do it in OS 9 either, so what was the exact 
purpose of your RANT?

Just a message from Doug... &gt;&gt;

</PRE>
