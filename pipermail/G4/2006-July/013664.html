<PRE>
&gt;<i> Thank you to everyone who has reported what you are seeing on my website.
</I>&gt;<i> Now I need some help to troubleshoot the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To recap: I can see only a gray color behind my flash title on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.paintmaking.com">http://www.paintmaking.com</A> in Safari 1.3.2 (v312.6) and Internet Explorer
</I>&gt;<i> 5.2.3 (5815.1). What should be there is a colored header image.
</I>
FYI, I run W98, XP, W2k as well as 10.4.7 on a G4. Your page resolves 
per your wishes on all machines &amp; browsers...here.

But?
In the Mac my Safari is Version 2.0.4 (419.3)
The WinBoxes (not all that up to date) run IE 6.0 2900.2180
Firefox is 1.5.0.4 on the Mac &amp; 1.8.4 on the Winboxes...
Opera is 9X
Further, (so or however) if you believe your 'problem' is more 
script/plug-in oriented it may not 'matter' as much which browser/OS the 
user has.
Each step you take from '.html' is a foot on the slippery slope as a 
visitor might not be getting what you're providing.
I began designing sites in '95 &amp; have never assumed the mob (potential 
customers for clients?) were going to be able to 'access' or 'view' 
state of the art techniques.
Are you aiming at the largest denominator if you include any features 
which demand the visitor have his machine configured &quot;as you have your 
machine configured&quot;?
How does your config compare to the 'average'?
Did you check out the stats so you know what versions of 
browsers/plug-ins people are using and make sure you have a site which 
will work with a significant % of visitors?

If a client demands the kitchen sink it usually means two sites:
One site can be full of 'current' tricks an look and work like next year 
-  - But a &quot;dumb&quot; site has to exist (re-directs can take place as soon 
as a 'dumber browser' is detected) or the outcome can be worse than your 
minor hitch. Depending on how much is demanded from a visitor, they may 
be getting a blank screen instead of a 2006 site.

If you wish to reach the largest number of visitors rather than impress 
a few  - -  A single, &quot;wow site&quot; may not cut it.
I may have Safari Version 2.0.4 but I'd not think a client's customers 
do &amp; would only provide features which can serve 'most' potential visitors.
A market may demand a second site (which is more basic) because it will 
still be accessible to more visitors.
A client's cash-flow is more important than my vanity.
