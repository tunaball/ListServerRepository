No problem Steve, I have the same perspective as a former PC guy when 
the XP crowd started it's own RANT on how everyone should abandon 
Windows 9x in favor of the latest offering from Mr. Gates.  That was 
one of the main reasons I started looking at other choices such as 
Linux and the Mac OS.  I'm just happy you aren't one of the people I 
ran into a lot after switching who wants to get into whole which is 
better Mac or PC.  I just enjoy computers and the things they do.

Just a message from Doug...
