You can use up to an 128 GB drive on this controller. You need to to  
find out if you have a rev 1 or 2 motherboard. The rev 1 boards have  
problems with some IDE drives. Check at <A HREF="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com">http://www.xlr8yourmac.com</A>  
for details and a pointer to a test program. I have used several  
modern IDE drives in my rev 1 Yikes with no problems. (I did run the  
test on each.)


&gt;<i> Then I was thinking that maybe I should upgrade to serial ATA,

Serial ATA is the way to go, but serial drives are still a little  
more than parallel drives and don't tend to have the huge rebates  
that make some parallel drives so inexpensive.

</I>
You should be able to get a DVD drive for $20-30 (or less used), but  
isn't a new controller, new hard drive, and DVD drive (plus what you  
could get by selling your Yikes) a good chunk of the cost of a  
Sawtooth which would have a G4 processor?
