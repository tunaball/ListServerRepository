<PRE>Wayne, you are correct that there is a problem with the names of the
processes involved. Bill was referring to First Aid. He called it Disk First
Aid; that's what it used to be called. In OS X, it is First Aid. Other than
that, he was correct.

OTOH, you are referring to Disk Utility. What you say about Disk Utility is
correct. To repair the boot drive, you need to boot from the Install CD (or
DVD, in the latest MDD G4s.) But the Repair Permissions routine in First Aid
should be run on the boot drive when booted from the boot drive. (That's the
thing you got &quot;in trouble&quot; for awhile back, when you said to do that, you
had to boot from the Install CD.)

However, fsck in the same routine as First Aid to repair a disk. It is the
same routine that is run, once, when you do a Safe Boot. As I wrote earlier
on this thread, booting into Single-User Mode allows you to run fsck -y
multiple times without rebooting. This you should do if you have problems
that are not corrected by a Safe Boot. Or, you could boot from the Install
CD and run Repair Disk from Disk Utility multiple times.

BTW, don't you wish the Unix dudes had used a different command than &quot;fsck&quot;
for this? It looks too much like the F word to sight-readers. (Yes, that is
a dig at non-phonics reading programs.)

Ok, I know I am getting myself in trouble again but here goes. From what I
have learned lately from the G4 board and Apple there is kind of a misnomer
going on. That is that fsck is NOT the equivalent of Disk Utility. That to
actually run Disk Utility it should be booted from a install cd and run from
their. From what I understand fsck is just a Unix file utility to help with
pre-bindings and such.

</I>&gt;<i> I removed Norton from my computers within the facility I work in and 
</I>&gt;<i> my personal machines for the exact same reason. Norton came up with 
</I>&gt;<i> all these errors that Disk First Aid didn't find. Try this: Boot in 
</I>&gt;<i> single users mode (hold down command key and the S) type fsck -y and 
</I>&gt;<i> see if it comes up with any problems. If, it says changes were made 
</I>&gt;<i> continue to run fsck -y until it
</I>&gt;<i> comes up with no changes were made. Then type reboot. This command is the
</I>&gt;<i> Unix version of Disk First Aid. You mentioned Drive 10, that is an
</I>&gt;<i> excellent
</I>&gt;<i> application and may solve your problem as well. I would first run the
</I>&gt;<i> command I stated above , then see what happens. Also, you may want to look
</I>&gt;<i> into Unix tools to help with disk issues. Try Developer Depot
</I>&gt;<i> www.devdepot.com type Unix Utilities for OS X it should come up with some
</I>&gt;<i> software that may help not only with disk issues but command line,
</I>&gt;<i> printer,etc.
