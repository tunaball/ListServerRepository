<PRE>I think part of the problem was that I forgot the heat sink clip 
didn't fit on this new board so I was trying to run it without a heat 
sink. It got hot pretty quick. We still can't find a clip but we did 
find a fan that fit right on it.

Then I found the original 8.6 G4 disk that came with the machine. 
This seems to be important as the machine needs at least 8.5 and I 
was using an 8.0 CD. That *finally* booted the machine, and I could 
see my formatted hard drive. The drive had been formatted in the new 
MDD with OS 9 drivers. It wouldn't boot the machine into OS X or OS 
8.6, that I had also installed on the drive.

I reformatted the drive from the 8.6 CD and with the drive in the 
Yikes! Still can't boot from it.. I have tried both Master and Cable 
select on the jumper. I cannot swear I was previously able to boot 
from this HD, OTOH I don't remember having an IDE drive I couldn't 
boot from.

Marc, you gave me a list to do, which gave me a really interesting 
&quot;PCI Bridge&quot; message before it went into the eternal Happy Face. This 
was before we cooled the processor though. I snapped a digital pic 
but don't know how well the error can be seen.

Groucho - thank you for your continued help and ideas. You are wonderful.

If anyone has more HD boot suggestions I am all ears lol. Not even 
sure I can get it on the internet from the CD to update it.

BTW, the firmware is showing 1.2f2 which I believe is the most 
current for the Yikes! PCI.

Thanks again,


Diane
