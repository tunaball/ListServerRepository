     Well, let's look at the cost of that approach:

1. OWC's lowest-priced CPU upgrade for the Sawtooth, the Mercury 
Extreme 1.25 GHz, is $500

2. (1) above with an NVidia GeForce 4MX (bundle) video card, add $100

3. 256 Mbyte PC100 DIMM from Data Memory Systems is $34.50 this weekend

4. 80 Gbyte Hitachi (IBM) DeskStar 7200 RPM drive from OWC is $87.95

     Ignoring taxes (if any) and shipping, that's around $720.

     Tiger says he doesn't have $3500, but let's say he goes to the 
Apple Store and CTO's his own G4 Dual 1.25 GHz, which for all the 
griping about its architecture is way faster than a single 1.25 GHz 
in a Sawtooth (and I mean _way_). If he gets two processors, but cuts 
corners and gets only 256 Mbyte of Apple's overpriced memory, an 80 
Gbyte drive (IBM DeskStars usually, 7200 rpm) instead of the stock 
160, a Combo drive instead of the SuperDrive, the Radeon 9000Pro 
instead of the GeForce Titanium, and no modem (does anybody still use 
those?), the Apple Store price is $1570. throw in 512 Mbyte of memory 
from Data Memory Systems ($72 this weekend), and it tops out at $1642.

     Over $900 difference, but what a difference in performance. If he 
wants a single-processor 1.25 GHz dual mirrored doors system from 
Apple, it would be $300 less.

     Now I don't know what the bottlenecks in ProTools plug-ins are, 
but I suspect all of the several dozen ones listed on Digidesign's 
site benefit from the following differences:

		Sawtooth			Dual Mirrored Doors
		--------			------------------
Bus speed		100 MHz			167 MHz
Disk controller	ATA-66			ATA-100 (at least first controller)

and maybe from:

Graphics slot:	2X AGP			4X AGP

     I don't have any CPU ugprades in desktop G4's, only one 1 GHz 
card in a Cube (the stock version of which has the same bus, ATA 
controller, and AGP slot as the Sawtooth). It helps a lot for general 
system zippiness (startup time, scrolling speed, time to apply 
Software Updates), and a little for real work like Photoshop. 
Absolutely no comparison with a dual 1.0-GHz desktop G4, much less a 
dual-1.25.

     It all depends on how much cash Tiger has to burn, and how much 
time he wants to spend watching beachballs spin.
