<PRE>Well Joe,
You and I are similar in our perception of and solution to the power 
issue. Two months ago I bought the last refurbished dual 867 at Small 
Dog for $1347 because I thought that was the end of the 9 bootable Macs.

When This &quot;new&quot; dual 1.25 came out on Tuesday morning for $1599 I did 
not hesitate to buy it and plan to sell my dual 867 for more than I 
paid for it because it boots 9 and because I was able to populate it 
with 512 MB more RAM from Office MAX for FREE and I have a bunch of 
small (25, 40, 60) 7200 RPM HDs laying around here that I can add to it 
as well. Plus I had the foresight (as I will with the dual 1.25) to 
REMOVE the original Apple HD and Combo drives before ever turning the 
computer on so I will be able to deliver a NEW HD and Optical to the 
buyer.

I also have the Verax Silent Fan System from Germany that brings the 
noise factor under control.

it comes down to how much credit Tiger can wield to step up from one of 
the oldest G4's to the last and possibly the best and most powerful 
(because it boots 9 unlike the dual 1.43) G4's that will ever be made.

NOTE: This &quot;new&quot; dual 1.25 MDD is SUPERIOR to this year's FW800 model 
because it has the 2MB L3 cache on each chip.
