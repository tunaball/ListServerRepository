<PRE>Good Morning Everyone

As the last request for help was so easily handled by the group, I'd 
like to ask for your advice again.

I purchased a G4 AGP Graphics about 9 months ago and over time have 
since then installed a 1 GHz upgrade from OWC, a Tempo Trio card to get 
USB2 and additional firewire (as the original seemed iffy) and of course 
to be able to add ATA133 drives, and topped up the memory to 1 GB. I'm 
running it on 10.3.9, with a dual boot that was only installed as it was 
necessary for other installations on the G4.

As good fortune would have it, they came out with the mini just after I 
had made the final change, for a fair bit less than I have invested in 
this ole girl, and she doesn't run as well as the G3 that I've had since 
new. (but the ole girl can't wear the new clothes that will get you into 
the better places these days).

The 3 major problems I'm facing right now are

(1) inconsistent connectivity with the USB and firewire connections to 
the external LaCie Firewire/USB burner and other (mainly) LaCie external 
HDs (firewire) (it was/is hit and miss which will enable the 
drive/burner) (couldn't get the discs or burners to be recognized) 

(2) the inability to transfer data from one drive to another without the 
system hanging (the new ones are on the Tempo Trio card either from the 
ATA or externally on the FW/USB 2 connections), and

(3) the inability to complete a cd or DVD burn on Toast 6. (It would 
hang at the end and I would have to reboot as the forced restart would 
not work) I can't be sure but this appears to be related to (2)

Given the problems I've had with this one vs the G3 which operated well 
as bought, I wonder if the problems below are related to the upgraded 
processor and/or the Tempo Trio card, or an interaction of the two

I've been using Macs at home exclusively since the Apple II and love the 
ability to access the internet without having to be prepared for unsafe 
inter(action), but these problems are starting to stretch my allegiance.

Any help or directions anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated.

Glen
