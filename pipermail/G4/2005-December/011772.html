This is the kind of info I was looking for.  Thank you.  I checked, 
and it has already been updated.

Doesn't seem to be an issue.  I think if it was going to go out, it 
would have by now.

&gt;<i>I just had a student buy a Quicksilver 733 for $325 so I don't think
</I>&gt;<i>you will get a Mini out of it.

I did some checking on eBay.  I think I can get a little more out of 
it by adding a DVD burner - which I already have.  It's not Apple 
certified, but it's listed as bootable and Patchburn compatible on 
the xlr8yourmac website.

I'm hoping to get a bargain on eBay.  It's happened before.  (I'm not 
holding my breath though...)

In any event, this computer is miles above the Mac he had - a 
7300/180 which isn't even working right now.
