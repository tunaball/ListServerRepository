Power Mac G4 (Mirrored Drive Doors) and (QuickSilver 2002) Education 
Model: About Cable Select and Adding Third-Party Drives
  This document discusses the cable select feature of Power Mac G4 
(Mirrored Drive Doors) and the education model of Power Mac 
(QuickSilver 2002) computers, and how it can be used to add drives from 
third-party manufacturers.

  The Power Mac G4 (Mirrored Drive Doors) and education model of Power 
Mac G4 (QuickSilver 2002) computers work with ATA and ATAPI internal 
storage devices that are set for cable select mode.

  The cable select feature forces the device to set its ID as either 
master or slave, based upon its position on the ATA/ATAPI cable:
	&#9642; 	If the device is attached to the end of the cable, then it 
identifies itself as a master.
	&#9642; 	If the device is at the middle cable position, then it identifies 
itself as a slave.

  Since cable select mode forces the drive to set its ID based upon its 
position on the cable, hard drives and optical drives can be easily 
configured.

  When installing additional ATA and ATAPI drives from another 
manufacturers, check the documentation that came with the drive, or 
check with the manufacturer to find out how to set the drive to the 
cable select mode.

Note: For the cable select setting to work properly, the cables you use 
must work with the cable select feature. For this reason, the original 
Apple cables that came with the computer should be used when installing 
additional drives. Some cables made by other manufacturers may not 
correctly work with the cable select mode.
