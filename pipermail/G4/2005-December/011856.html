2 way KVMs go for $20 to $100 depending on features and how much  
you're willing to overpay for a brand that makes you feel  
comfortable. (Cough, Belkin, cough.) Jim can safely just ignore the  
'K' and 'M' parts of the switch.

Roger's systems has 2 and 4 way VGA manual switch boxes for $8 and  
$10 respectively, but by the time you add cables you're better off  
getting an inexpensive KVM that comes with the cables built-in. Fry's  
Electronics has them for $30 and they are regularly on sale for $20.  
(<A HREF="http://www.outpost.com/,">http://www.outpost.com/,</A> if you don't have a store near you.)

One thing that Jim needs to keep in mind is that he will also need an  
Apple video to VGA adaptor if he doesn't already have one.
