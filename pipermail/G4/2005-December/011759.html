<PRE>

Thanks for the various comments.  I have several
questions:

**Can I go DIRECTLY from 9.1 to  9.2.2?

**Regarding the OSX &quot;Classic&quot;&quot; mode  most of the
applications I use for my business are running on OS
9.1 so would they run on the OSX Classic mode?  

**How does one got &quot;get&quot; from OSX to Classic  mode or
do you have to re-boot the computer or can you toggle
from one OS to the other?

**Will all my periperals still work in OSX and  will I
be able to use my Samsung ML-1210 printer with OSX? 

**Should I consider buying a new dual boot computer
with a faster processor or is my 400 mhz. enough?

**What I'm trying to get a sense of is that suppose
I'm using a new OSX capable Broswer and want to cut
and paste some text from the browser into one of my
Classic (OS 9.1 apps) documents. Can I do that without
any problem  like my using a very old Microsoft Works
3.0  app. which is about15 years old but runs fine on
9.1?

**&quot;All things being equal&quot;, will running things (like
web browsing) in OSX be faster or will the Classic 
environment be slower?

Any comments will be greatly appreciated.  I'm just
scared of screwing things up by changing operating
systems and causing myself lots of extra work and
expense in buying new software.

This is making me battey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Thanks,

Sy

IMHO, you should update to 9.2.2 and NS 4.8. Get the
9.2.2 update at
&lt;<A HREF="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=75288">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=75288</A>&gt;
and the Netscape 
4.8
update at
&lt;<A HREF="http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/download/archive47x.jsp">http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/download/archive47x.jsp</A>
&gt;<i>. 
</I>Much
better performance on the G4 than 9.1 and NS 4.79.
Also, as others have
stated, most OS 9 apps work via OS X's Classic, but in
your case you 
can
have both a bootable OS 9 and a bootable OS X
installation on your 
machine,
which allows you to experiment w/OS X, while retaining
the ability to 
do
things exactly as you do now.
