Many questions in one message need many answers.

USB 2.0 devices are frequently backward compatible with USB 1.1 but  
they will run slower because they are stepping down to match the  
slower speed. I am using an external FireWire box for a second DVD  
burner and suggest that as an alternative method to the speed  
matching problem between USB versions. You have FireWire as a built- 
in function, so use it to your advantage.

You didn't say whether the Sony device was a stand-alone device that  
must be connected to TVs or VCRs or has to be linked through the G4  
video card to those machines. If it's a stand-alone device, there may  
be some compatibility problems right from the start. Normally, I have  
found Sony products to be compatible with my Macs, but I haven't  
tried to use the Sony machine you have.

As to making and copying DVDs, neither of your copies of Toast will  
do that with a commercial DVD. They cannot overcome the copy  
protection of the DVDs. You will have to use a program like  
MacTheRipper (look for it at VersionTracker's web site or do a google  
search for it, it's free) to rip the video files from any DVD you  
want to copy except for a DVD that you or someone else compile by  
using a program like iDVD or iMovie. Be sure to print out the read-me  
file and follow the instruction carefully when you use MacTheRipper.

You did right by getting Toast because the native DVD/CD burning  
software that Apple gives us isn't as capable. There are a couple  
other Mac burning programs, but I haven't had as much success with  
them as with Toast. I looked at the DivX web site and it looks like  
you would not need it unless you wanted to make DVDs that work with  
specific machines and that isn't evident from your comments.

Anyway, why worry about DivX when you already have Toast 7 which can  
make DivX compatible disks through the Video function. Just go into  
the video section and select DivX disk as the format you want and  
burn away.

Hope these answers/hints help you.
