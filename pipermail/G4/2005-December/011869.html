<PRE>I would first think about an OS upgrade 10.4 has a variety of fixes  
that may help.

Also check with the vendors of third party peripherals for driver  
upgrades.

I had a lot of CD burning problems using Toast and OS burning, turns  
out it was the media some brands are just better than others.
Also sometimes burning at a lower setting helps.

</I>&gt;<i> I purchased a G4 AGP Graphics about 9 months ago and over time have

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As good fortune would have it, they came out with the mini just

</I>&gt;<i> that I've had since new. (but the ole girl can't wear the new  
</I>&gt;<i> clothes that will get you into the better places these days).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 3 major problems I'm facing right now are
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1) inconsistent connectivity with the USB and firewire connections  
</I>&gt;<i> to the external LaCie Firewire/USB burner and other (mainly) LaCie  
</I>&gt;<i> external HDs (firewire) (it was/is hit and miss which will enable  
</I>&gt;<i> the drive/burner) (couldn't get the discs or burners to be recognized)
</I>&gt;<i> (2) the inability to transfer data from one drive to another  
</I>&gt;<i> without the system hanging (the new ones are on the Tempo Trio card  
</I>&gt;<i> either from the ATA or externally on the FW/USB 2 connections), and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (3) the inability to complete a cd or DVD burn on Toast 6. (It  
</I>&gt;<i> would hang at the end and I would have to reboot as the forced  
</I>&gt;<i> restart would not work) I can't be sure but this appears to be  
</I>&gt;<i> related to (2)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the problems I've had with this one vs the G3 which operated  
</I>&gt;<i> well as bought, I wonder if the problems below are related to the  
</I>&gt;<i> upgraded processor and/or the Tempo Trio card, or an interaction of  
</I>&gt;<i> the two
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been using Macs at home exclusively since the Apple II and  
</I>&gt;<i> love the ability to access the internet without having to be  
</I>&gt;<i> prepared for unsafe inter(action), but these problems are starting  
</I>&gt;<i> to stretch my allegiance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any help or directions anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated.
