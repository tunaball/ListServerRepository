<PRE>Thanks for all the help folks.  To clarify and to recap my situation, when I 
try to install Panther, a grey screen with the apple logo comes up.  There 
is a spinning graphic underneath it and after a minute or so the monitor 
goes to sleep.  After that point, I have no idea what is going on.  I tried 
installing Panther by pressing C as the computer booted and when that did 
not work, I installed OS 9.2 and then opened the panther cd and ran the 
install program.  I even used XPostFacto (which told me that the OS had 
sneered at how old my video card rom was, and that it was unhappy about 
something invalid with the serial ports.)  The results were all the same.  
The monitor goes to sleep after a minute and stays that way.  I tried 
installing it with a 256mb module I pulled from a beige G3.  No go.  I 
installed a nice new shiny module from Microcenter (the mac guy there swore 
by it).  Still no.  If it is a matter of the monitor going into engery 
saving mode prematurely, I shall probably try one of the older monitors I 
have lying around to see if I have better luck.  The computer currently has 
a 10gb hard drive but I am waiting for a 40gb hard drive I got from ebay to 
arrive to install in it.  Also, according to Apple, I don't need to update 
my firmware.

I will let you all know if changing monitors did the trick.


</PRE>
