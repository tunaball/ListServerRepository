<PRE>Hi Ronald,

Presumably you saw the message to which I was replying.

A quotation of particular significance is: &quot;Thank you all for  
responding. I'll try zapping it when I can get over there.  Hmmm...  
we had already switched out the controller card, thinking that would  
do the trick, no dice. It was a Rage 128 pro, maybe that's not enough?&quot;

I was responding to Roxylee that a Rage 128 card is not an ATA  
controller. Perhaps confusion arised because of its brand being ATI?

And to answer question 2, Roxylee is talking about using a very large  
hard drive in that Mac, and it isn't supported at its full capacity  
with the built-in controller. Ergo, a third-party controller card  
would be an excellent solution at this point.

3, I don't know which video card was removed and which was installed.  
I'd simply encourage Roxylee to use the newest available card, since  
there is no logical reason not to. The better the video card, the  
more capable the system is of various video-related tasks; most  
especially, of course, 3D.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. What is the need for a PCI ATA/IDE controller card? Is there an

</I>&gt;<i> there are no bus ribbon connections left? I do not see what this  
</I>&gt;<i> type of card has to do with a drive icon showing on the screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Why put in &quot;the best one available&quot; if there is no problem with  
</I>&gt;<i> the original and it does what is wanted all the time? Upgrading the  
</I>&gt;<i> video card should not have any effect on the presence of an icon  
</I>&gt;<i> for a drive that is not connected to the bus.
