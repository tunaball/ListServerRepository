&gt;<i>Hi robert,

</I>&gt;<i>Thank you for your reply and the information provided. I have

</I>&gt;<i>up in OS 9 with desktop messages appearing that state that since I 
</I>&gt;<i>have started up from the DVD certain functions will not be available.
</I>&gt;<i>So after all this I was able to speak with tech support from the 
</I>&gt;<i>people I purchased the disk from and their feelings are that the DVD 
</I>&gt;<i>is a bad disk and they are going to replace it. (YAY!)
</I>&gt;<i>So we'll see once I receive the new disk if my problem is solved. If 
</I>&gt;<i>you would like, once I do (or if) I'll update you so that you can be 
</I>&gt;<i>informed as to what ended up solving this issue. Let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Once again, I thank you for your help.
</I>&gt;<i>Best.
</I>&gt;<i>Mike Lemos

Yes please keep me updated. As you guessed I like to know the outcome 
of my attempts to help &lt;g&gt;.

BTW: Failure to show up in the option-key list implies that the disk 
has no System folder and is thus not bootable. You can check by just 
mounting and opening the DVD.
