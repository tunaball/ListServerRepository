<PRE>Hi robert,

Thank you for your reply and the information provided. I have actually 
tried these suggestions and the disk does show up as bootable in the 
system preferences and I select it, restart and the computer does the 
mac &quot;chime&quot; after which it ejects the disk. When I try holding down the 
option key the DVD does not list. I also have tried holding down the 
&quot;C&quot; key and the disk simply ejects although I have had one other 
occurrence when doing this and that is it starts up in OS 9 with 
desktop messages appearing that state that since I have started up from 
the DVD certain functions will not be available.
So after all this I was able to speak with tech support from the people 
I purchased the disk from and their feelings are that the DVD is a bad 
disk and they are going to replace it. (YAY!)
So we'll see once I receive the new disk if my problem is solved. If 
you would like, once I do (or if) I'll update you so that you can be 
informed as to what ended up solving this issue. Let me know.

Once again, I thank you for your help.
Best.
Mike Lemos

</I>&gt;<i> Put the DVD in the drive after you've booted into MacOS X. Now select 
</I>&gt;<i> Start Up Disk from System Preferences and see if the DVD shows up. If 
</I>&gt;<i> not, then the DVD is not bootable (or you do not have a DVD Drive). If 
</I>&gt;<i> it shows up then select the DVD and restart (it should now boot off 
</I>&gt;<i> it). Do not worry about pointing at the DVD Drive since once it is 
</I>&gt;<i> removed, the system will give the Folder with Question Mark logo and 
</I>&gt;<i> then boot off your Hard Drive (Do not forget to reset the Boot Drive 
</I>&gt;<i> back  to the Hard Drive or it will continue to do this until you do). 
</I>&gt;<i> You can also try booting with the DVD in the drive and holding OPTION. 
</I>&gt;<i> This will give you a list of bootable drives to select from (Select 
</I>&gt;<i> the DVD) for THIS boot without resetting the boot drive as the System 
</I>&gt;<i> Preference does.
