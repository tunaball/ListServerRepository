<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param><x-tad-smaller>I continue to shop
for a standalone DVD burner compatible with Mac OSX.  I want to
transfer my VHS/Beta tapes onto DVDs.  I prefer a burner with an
internal drive of at least 60-80 GB.  As for A/D converters, they're
tempting, but I haven't bought the Canopus because of the logistics of
connecting audio/video cables from VCRs and turntable (for LP burning)
not near my Mac.


Double layer DVDs (DVD+R DL) burned on my Superdrive play well on my
Toshiba DVD player, but often skip around on my older Panasonic
player.  MacWorld recommends the Pioneer DVR-533/633H-S recorder. 
Biggest flaw: users dislike its noisy hard drive that constantly
downloads TV Guide (on or off).


No one unit seems to have all the desired features or is liked by all
its users.  Does anyone recommend the Pioneer DVR-533/633H-S?
