Not sure if it will fix your problem, but I can re-assure you that
there is no drama with respect to flashing the card.  I have flashed
my 8500 back and forth between ROMs about 20 times now trying to debug
some issues with sleep and TVout.  


One thing though, I do recall on my card that there is a setting in
the ATI displays that tells the card to provide all resolutions v.
just resolutions it thinks it should...may have a look around for that
in ATI displays...
