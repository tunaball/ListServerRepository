I'm thinking that this used to be true in the pre-gigabyte days when
the heads actually rested on the disk.  Once the disk spun to speed
the heads would fly over the surface, but while the disk was spinning
up or spinning down they would drag on the surface (which was
lubricated to reduce wear).  The number of start/stop cycles figures
into the disk drive MTBF equation.  However, now that drives use
dynamic head loading (heads loaded after disk is spinning) there is no
longer head to disk contact and start/stops are less of a concern than
they once were.  I'm only talking about the mechanics, not the
electronics of the drive.


<excerpt>Let's just say that the act of spinning up a harddrive is
more stressful

(to the drive) than days worth of running. (Yes, that applies to "put

drive to sleep when idle" too. It may save you energy, but not
necessarily

money. :-)<color><param>0000,6363,1212</param><smaller>
