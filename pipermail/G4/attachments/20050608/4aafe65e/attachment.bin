</fontfamily><fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>Tonight I was doing some
routine maintenance and found a folder called "IsmTempFile" that was
over 650 MB in size. Inside were files going back to March 20 ranging
in size from 1MB to 56MB. All of them are named "ns3704880.tmp" or
similar. They all start with "ns", then numbers, then .tmp. I run
Cocktail and Cache cleaner about every other day and neither trashed
this file. I can't imagine a program that feels the need to store 650
MB of stuff on my computer. I tried opening two of them using Word's
"recover any text" function and just saw a bunch of ASCII garbage, but
it may be encrypted information. Any clues. I did a Google search and
only came up with two hits with people asking questions about it. I
can't remember where I found it but I think it was in my
Library/Cache/Preferences file.

Thanks.
