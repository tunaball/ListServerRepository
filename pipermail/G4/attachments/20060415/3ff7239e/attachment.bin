<bigger><bigger>Has anyone with DiskWarrior 3.0 successfully updated
his/her DiskWarrior to 3.0.3 on a blank CD using the downloaded
Updater?  I get error messages and I've ruined several CDs trying it. 
Tech help hasn't been able to correct the problem.  I've been able to
save to my desktop the .dmg file the Updater creates, but using the
Updater, or using Disk Utility to burn a CD from the .dmg image
haven't worked.


If you have successfully updated and burned a CD with DiskWarrior
3.0.3 on it, please share your secret.  Thanks.</bigger></bigger>
