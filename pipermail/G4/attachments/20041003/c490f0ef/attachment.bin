Hey guys, 


I had just bought a used G4 Digital Audio.  It has 733 mHz/768 RAM/120
GIG HD/<bold>AGP GForce2MX graphic card (Standard Graphic
card)</bold>.  I am looking at getting a faster graphic card or better
one at least.  My question is: Which one is better?  ATI 9000 or
NVIDIA?  I am leaning towards the ATI's brand, but which model?  Any
help is greatly appreciated.


Thanks,


Seth J.


PS - I am using OS X 1.2.8 and will be upgrading to 10.3 really soon.
