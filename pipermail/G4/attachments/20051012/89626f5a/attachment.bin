<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>I have an external firewire
drive connected to my G4. (OS 10.3.9) I connect to my G4 remotely with
my powerbook laptop in another room in the house via an ethernet
router. I have 2 hard drives in my G4. When I "connect to server" from
the finder of my laptop, I can get to my G4, see and connect to both
of those internal drives. I cannot see or connect to the external
firewire drive, even though when I physically go to my G4, it is there
on the desktop. What am I missing? Does that software solution apply
to this too? Thanks for any help.
