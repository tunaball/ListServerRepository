Hi Greg,


Thank you for the advice. Fortunately, I don't have a disk space
problem. What I did have was a font problem. I guess I should have
googled the problem before posting to the list because when I did I
found loads of forums referring to this. The day before the problem
occurred I had installed some fonts and it was one of these that was
causing the problem. To solve it I moved all of my non-standard fonts
out of the fonts folder and onto my desktop.

This is a long shot, but do you have plenty of spare hard drive

capacity?


I had this problem a couple of years ago and it turned out to be a

lack of spare HD space on the system drive. The space was needed for

the memory manager (formerly virtual memory on pre OSX).


You need about 2 gig spare as a minimum. There was an Apple knowledge

base article about this, but I have forgotten the details.


When I cleaned out my HD, everything went back to normal including

the missing mail.
