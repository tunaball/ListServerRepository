Alex is right.  Using terminal you can get the JRE version:


Apollo:~ pacyga$ java -version

java version "1.4.2_05"

Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_05-141.4)

Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2-38, mixed mode)


However, the Java plug-in for Safari is separate (Help->Installed
Plug-ins):

The 1.3.1 plug-in seems to be the latest...perhaps Tiger has a newer
Plug-in...?

<excerpt>Alex, et al-

I am trying to take some on-line training that requires Java version
1.4.2 (verified with a tech-assist phone call) and appears to be
written for Windows systems.  Each and ever time I access the server
with any browser I have (Safari, firefox, IE, Netscape), a java
console pops up in the background with the following data on it:
