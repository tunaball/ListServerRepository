INSTALLING A SUPERDRIVE

HI FOLKS		,


I am wanting to install a superdrive Pioneer 107. I currently have a
CD Combo drive. What I would really like to do is to install the
Pioneer 107 as a second CD/DVD drive. The space underneath the
existing combo drive is much smaller and probably intended for a ZIP
drive.


I seem to remember a year ago or so, that there was some discussion on
how to permit that smaller opening to hold a 5.25" drive.  Can somehow
either direct me to those posts, or refresh my memory on how to do it.


I would also like to install a third hard drive. I have purchased a
Sonnet Tempo ATA 133 PCI card to support this third drive -- in
particular because it is a  200 gig hard drive. Can someone tell me
where I can mount this 3rd drive?


Thanks for your help.


Sincerely,

Rich
