Thanks for the suggestions. BTW, I also checked my Macs firmware and
think its out of date. Apple says I should have 4.2.8 installed but it
can only be installed if you have OS 9.x on your hard drive (which I
don't). I can back up my files, reinstall OS 9.x, update the firmware,
reinstall OS X, etc. That is a lot of work which I would rather not do
if I don't have to.


Below is my System Profile...question though, is this the correct
firmware before I go to all this trouble or not? Can anyone else with
a G4 AGP confirm by checking their firmware and letting me know what
they have? Thanks, you may save me a lot of trouble!

<excerpt>Did you contact Keyspan and see if there is a firmware update
for the card?  Also, did you trash all the com.apple.PowerManagement.*
files on your machine, then clear the PRAM (startup with OPT-CMD-P-R
held down until the beep)?  Sometimes the settings get funky and cause
issues - i had that happen with the AGP and an iMac - this fixed them.


Lastly is your PRAM battery dead?  Another source of never ceasing
wonders...

<excerpt>Hi there,


After I installed a Keyspan U2PCI-5 USB 2.0 card my G4 450 AGP
(Sawtooth) running OS 10.3.5 won't wake from sleep (unless I do a
forced restart) after putting it to sleep. On its own, it just won't
go to sleep at all now (fan runs and power light stays green, not
amber).


If nothing is plugged into card, then no problems. Otherwise,
problems. This defeats the purpose of the new high speed card since
the built in is only USB 1.0.


Does anyone know of a USB 2.0 card that will work on a G4 AGP
(Sawtooth) without these problems? If so, I would be eternally
gratefull! Thanks. Casey.
