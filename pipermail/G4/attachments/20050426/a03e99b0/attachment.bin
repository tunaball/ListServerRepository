Hey John - WELCOME!!!


Could you give us a little more info?  Such as, what Mac model are you
using (iMac, eMac, etc.), what OS (Operating System, i.e.: OS X
10.3.5, 10.2.8, ???), and what printer (Epson 740, HP PhotoSmart 1215,
etc.)?


The more info you give, the more qualified the answers will be.


Let us know - we'll be happy to help!

<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><smaller><x-tad-smaller> 1. When I
print,  it's OK if I print from Word or Pagemaker, but when I print
from Safari or Preview I get the page reduced right down to about one
inch square in the bottom left corner. And it's not the printer
because it does the same on a print preview. Can you help?</x-tad-smaller></smaller></fontfamily></excerpt><excerpt>


<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><smaller><x-tad-smaller> 2. The
machine freezes occasionally, usually when it's been idel for a little
while, and it makes an intermittent "beep-beep" when it does so. I
usually have to unplug it, and then I lose the time and date too.
Again can you help?</x-tad-smaller></smaller></fontfamily></excerpt><excerpt>
