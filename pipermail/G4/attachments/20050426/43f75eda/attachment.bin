The first thing to do is check page setup in safari and preview and
make sure the settings are correct.


The loss of date and time after unplugging means the pram battery is
dead. Assuming you have a G4 is is easy to replace, just open up the
case. the battery is readily visible in the Motherboard.


The freeze up could be a number of things, please supply more info,
use system profiler to get the specifics of your machine and post the
info.

<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><smaller> 1. When I print,  it's OK
if I print from Word or Pagemaker, but when I print from Safari or
Preview I get the page reduced right down to about one inch square in
the bottom left corner. And it's not the printer because it does the
same on a print preview. Can you help?</smaller></fontfamily>


<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><smaller> 2. The machine freezes
occasionally, usually when it's been idel for a little while, and it
makes an intermittent "beep-beep" when it does so. I usually have to
unplug it, and then I lose the time and date too. Again can you help?</smaller></fontfamily>
