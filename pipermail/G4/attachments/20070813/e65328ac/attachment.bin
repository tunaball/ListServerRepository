<excerpt>Hi,

I am trying to regain some of my drive space and cant seem to find out
how to remove the unnecessaty files and drivers. I have tinker tools
and did the language thing and all but I know I have the "extra"
printer drivers installed and know they take a ton of space. Can
anyone tell me how to remove all the drivers other than the ones I am
using without doing an install?

Actually can anyone recommend any other "space saving" deletions that
would help?

I am running 10.4.10 on a 1.42 mini with 1 gig ram. 

 I do have a rather large iTunes file,I like "my music" and use the
mini as a jukebox and background music box and thats is the single
largest use of drive space but not one I am willing to remove or "thin
out".

Ant help/advice/opinions will be appreciated.

Thank you,

A J
