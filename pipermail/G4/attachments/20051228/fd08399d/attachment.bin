<bigger><bigger>Great to have found this site!


My Mac is a Power Mac G4 733 Quicksilver bought in 9/2001.  Running OS
X 10.3 9.  640 MB RAM, Iomega ZIP 250, just installed a 16X
Superdrive.  I also added 2 external firewire hard drives, a LaCie 74
GB and a Fantom 233 GB.  HP OfficeJet G85xi printer.  Apple 20" Cinema
Display.


I'm purchasing a Sony VDR-VC20 DVDirect DVD Recorder.  The manual
states that it connects to a Mac via a Hi-Speed USB (USB
2.0-compliant) interface.


My question is, my Mac has USB 1.1, right?  Will the Sony VRDVC20
DVDirect DVD Recorder work with my Mac's USB 1.1, work slower, or not
work at all?


Will I have to use the Sony as a standalone only, with analog
connections to my VCRs?


I am a beginner at making and copying DVDs.  I have Toast Titanium 6
and 7 and need to learn iMovie, iDVD.  Don't know if I need DivX?


Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
