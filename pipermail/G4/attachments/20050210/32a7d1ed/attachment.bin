Hi, I have a G4 466 AGP
and<bold><fontfamily><param>Verdana</param><smaller> </smaller></fontfamily></bold>a
Power Computing display. I wanted to buy a microphone and read that
the standard G4 mic won't work with this machine. Can someone tell me
exactly what microphone/connector I can use? There is a little jack
port (not USB) in the front of the monitor. Will that work with the
G4? 


Thanks for your help,
