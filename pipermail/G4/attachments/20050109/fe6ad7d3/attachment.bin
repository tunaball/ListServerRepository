Jon, why not keep the 200gb drive... us it as 128gb, then when you get
the ATA controller card, you can transfer the data - reformat the
drive - transfer the data back and you will have your 200gb drive.


This will save you time, effort and hassles!


My 2¢


HAVE A WONDERFUL WEEK!!!

Neither Apple's support site nor Maxtor's support site were any help
in telling me what's wrong here. Is the IDE controller in my G4 *that
bad* that it can't recognize space above 128gb?

There's nothing wrong with your controller, it's just built to an
older standard. You can get a new PCI IDE controller from most any Mac
store. It'll just cost you 3-5X what the same card would cost for a PC.

Thanks for the help everyone!


Fow now I'm giong to exchange my 200gb ATA for a 120gb instead. As
soon as I can, though, I am going to invest in an SATA board.


Again, thanks.
