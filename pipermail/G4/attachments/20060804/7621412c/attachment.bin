Too busy? After two years? What kind of business man is that. It is an
automatic e-mail, one, maybe two seconds, highlight delete. How tough
can it be? How many other list users have been misled by these claims
of cheap Mac stuff?

<excerpt>Hea, Macintosh Guy,

What's up wit ListMom? There are NO items at the E-Bay link she/you
keep sending us to. Are the closets empty? If you are going to shill
for E-bay you might want to make sure you have something to shill out.

The List Mom, The Macintosh Guy of Portland, is a very busy man who
runs a company, Dr. Bott LLC.

It is nice of him to sponsor all the E-mail Lists:

"Listmom is trying to clean out his closets! Vintage Mac and random
stuff:

About two years ago I picked up two items from the above eBay Store,
but I believe that "the closets" have been empty since then, and he is
probably too busy to remove these lines from all the e-mail trailers.
