<excerpt>Hi,


I am new to the world of mac, so new in fact that I have not even used
it yet. A buddy of mine gave me a G4 AGP (i think) but it had no disk
drive. I have installed an 80gb drive but I still have no OS, how do I
get this ? I would prefer tiger but I heard that there are different
disks for different machines. I am desperate to try out os x but have
so far struggled.


Any help would be much appreciated.

Welcome to our world. Do you know it the platform that you were given
has Memory? To run Tiger on a G4 AGP you should have at least:


- 512 MB of RAM are almost unusable under Tiger.

- 512 MB of RAM are usable under Panther.

- 1024 MB of RAM is perfectly usable under Tiger & Panther.


I'm running Panther and have 1750 MB and everything runs just fine.


As for the version of Tiger that you need depends on whether you a CD
or a DVD drive installed in the box. I believe that you can not
purchase a CD version of Tiger, but you can get the CD version
directly from Apple. Other wise you will need the retail version which
should install on all platforms. You would not be able to use one that
is marked for the iMac or eMac or any of the specialized models that
are offer by Apple.
