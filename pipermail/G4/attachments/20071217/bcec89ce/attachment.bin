I'm not sure that it will fix your iTunes problems but you could try
quitting iTunes and deleting the following files that are located in
your <fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param><smaller>Preferences
folder.</smaller></fontfamily>


com.apple.iTunes.eq.plist

com.apple.iTunes.plist

com.apple.iTunesHelper.plist


These document files should be rebuilt the next time that you start
iTunes, however if they are present they wont be rebuilt, they will be
referenced for the information that they contain.

I am running a G4 sawtooth w/ OS X 10.4.11 and the

latest version of iTunes.


the problem is sometimes i import an album, iTunes

separate the songs into to albums. each with it own

album cover. how do i fix this?

  

</excerpt>I've had the same problem.  At times, it will break down an
album into multiple folders, making it very annoying to locate the
imported album...  Maybe this is because this album is actually
composed of songs from several different album releases? You can
highlight the song in iTunes and then from the File menu choose "Show
in Finder", to show you the folder where each of the songs is actually
located.  I don't know how to fix this, for sure, to make all the
songs belong to one folder.  Possibly, retagging all of the songs with
Musorg or a similar program might work, but I haven't spent the time
to try it...
