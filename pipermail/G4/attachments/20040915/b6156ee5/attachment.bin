Hi Valerie, one solution may be to remove the hard drive from the
broken computer and install it in an external firewire enclosure.
These cost about $100. Your local techie shop can probably do this.
Alternatively, email me off line and if you send the drive to me, I
will do it for you. 


I dont know about the zip drive, maybe others can answer that one.

here can help me.  My daughter has a Quicksilver G4 that was bought
for her by Make-A-Wish almost three years ago.  She is terminally ill
and basically confined to bed, so her computer is her lifeline.  She
watches many movies a day on it as well as doing her homebound
schoolwork.  After replacing the hard drive once and the SuperDrive
twice and eventually even the logic board and processor, Apple has
agreed to give her new computer.  We are extremely grateful, but we
are trying to find a way to pull off her most recent work from the
hard drive.  I don't know if it will be possible since the computer
will not successfully been to try and plays this hard drive in the G3
we have here or if I can even take a second hard drive.  I was also
wondering if ZIP 250 from this computer can be run in either the older
G3 or the new G5.</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>
