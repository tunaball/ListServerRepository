<excerpt>My digital speakers recently began emitting a high-pitched,

interference-like sound when the volume is cranked up. This is a

processor-upgraded 533 Digital Audio G4. It started the behavior in
the past

week. Nothing in the hardware or software has been changed in at least
two

months. I have restarted the machine, unplugged and replugged the
speakers

and turned off various nearby electronic devices.

Do you have a microphone connected and activated im Sound


Your noise look like a feedback of sound from the speaker in the
microphone.


Good luck
