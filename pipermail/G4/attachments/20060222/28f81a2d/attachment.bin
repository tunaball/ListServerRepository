<bigger><bigger><bigger>Thanks, Wade, for your suggestion.  My
one-bedroom apt. needs a media room badly, and it would have one if I
just had a second bedroom.  Alas, if I must resort, as you seem to
suggest, to going the A/D Canopus route, the worst I would have to do
is temporarily move my Beta VCR and/or my turntable and amplifier into
my bedroom where my computer setup is.  I already have a VHS VCR/DVD
player combo near my computer workstation, so for any VHS transferring
I'm good to go on that aspect of DVD conversion.


I take it you found none of the standalone DVD burners to your
satisfaction (unless you mean your Tivo)?  If I don't find something
better, I'm going to probably resolve to put up with the chirping
sound the Pioneer 533 or 633 makes as it downloads the TV Guide,
whether the machine is on or off.  I can keep it out of the bedroom at
least and it can reside in the living room with my other electronics,
including another VHS deck and the turntable.  Oh, yes, forgot, also a
reel-to-reel tape deck (the reel tapes beg for conversion as they are
in great danger of disintegrating from age).


I have thought about getting DirecTV and Tivo eventually.


Thanks, Don in D.C.</bigger></bigger></bigger>

Here's a thought...  Move your Mac closer to your VCR & turntable or
move your VCR & turntable closer to your Mac.


Rearranging your house can give you a whole new outlook on life.


I moved my computers over to the other side of the room and now I can
connect to our entertainment center - DirecTV-Tivo, VCR and DVD player.


I have to use an external firewire drive enclosure to bridge the gap
between the computers and the A/D converter (and duck under a cable to
get to the storage room door when I'm connected), but it's only a
minor inconvenience.
