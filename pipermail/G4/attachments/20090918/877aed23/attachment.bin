Help!


I can´t open up utube videos. By the talk of the town on this site I
have figured out it has to do with the new requirment- flashplayer 10-
to open up the vids. 


Is that correct?


In that case what can I do to solve this problem and still keep my

6.4.1- </x-tad-smaller></fontfamily>set up ?

ps I´m a bassplayer in a band doing mostly covers. When we´re about to
refill our setlist we use utube wich comes in very handy. A gig is
coming up soon so it´s quit urgent.ds
