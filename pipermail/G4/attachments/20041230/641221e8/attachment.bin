Start with the "C" key pressed.  Then you'll get OS X.  Then under the
apple (top left) your able to reset/give a new password.

<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><x-tad-bigger>I’m not an MAC user, but
recently a friend approached me with a MAC he inherited from a family
member whose got it locked down thru password. It’s a G4 Mac w/OS X
(?). I was not able to do anything for him initially so I bought MAC
OS X via eBay and attempted to access it No-Way! I thought like MS it
would boot fm the dvd, but it didn’t and theres been no progress
there.It almost seems that the firmware password protection software
fm the APPLE site was installed and I just can’t get past it even
following the instructions on that same site.</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>
