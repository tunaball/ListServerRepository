Hi Manny,


 A search on Apple Support website produced the following which might
solve your problem:-


<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param> If you forget your password
for your computer, insert the Mac OS X CD and restart your computer
while holding down the C key on the keyboard. When the Installer
appears, choose Reset Password from the Installer menu and follow the
onscreen instructions.


If the previous owner used Filevault and set a master password, then
without that, I think the only way to use the computer is to start
from scratch by erasing the hard drive and and install a fresh copy of
OS X from the dvd.


 Regards,


Alastair.

<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><x-tad-bigger>I’m not an MAC user, but
recently a friend approached me with a MAC he inherited from a family
member whose got it locked down thru password. It’s a G4 Mac w/OS X
(?). I was not able to do anything for him initially so I bought MAC
OS X via eBay and attempted to access it No-Way! I thought like MS it
would boot fm the dvd, but it didn’t and theres been no progress
there.It almost seems that the firmware password protection software
fm the APPLE site was installed and I just can’t get past it even
following the instructions on that same site.</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>
