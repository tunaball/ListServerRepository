Greetings G4 List Members.


I've started getting this message when I try to access a message in my
sent Mailbox and I haven't been able to find a reason why.


The only way that I've found to clear it, is to quite and restart
"Mail."


----------------------------------------------------

<italic>The message from Xxxxx Yyyyyyy <<xxxxx@yyyyyyyyy.com>
concerning “Re: [G4] upgrade problem - can't boot to new system” has
not been downloaded from the server. You need to take this account
online in order to download it.

---------------------------------------------------- 


All of my accounts are online and message is in my "sent mailbox" and
not on a server.

Like I said, all that I have to do is quite and restart "Mail" and the
message goes away and the sent eMail message is accessible. However
sometime later, perhaps 1-2 hours it will reappear.</italic>
