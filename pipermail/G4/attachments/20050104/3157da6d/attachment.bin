Linda-


Did you put the firmware upgrade on the machine?


G4 Sawtooths need a firmware upgrade in order to accommodate Panther. 
If you don't have at least Boot ROM revision level 4.2.8 f1.


(check System Profiler for ROM version).


You can download it from Apple.com/support.

500mhz G4 Tower. (I think that might be a Sawtooth).  It came with
9.1.  But I want to put Panther on.  It kept freezing on the Panther
install so I took out all but the 128 stick, partitioned the 20 gig
drive so the first partition was about 7.5 gigs and then was able to
install but not get through registration.  So I bought a 512 chip from
OWC figuring it might be memory.  Installed the memory and got through
registration.  But now it freezes upon opening hard drive partitions -
usually while the window is zooming up or the mouse freezes or the
monitor goes to sleep and I can't get it to wake up.  Reset the Pram
(3 chimes).  Very frustrated.  I would appreciate any thoughts or
troubleshooting ideas.</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>
