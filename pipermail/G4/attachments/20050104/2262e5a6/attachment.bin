A good source for Sonnet upgrade cards is sparco.com. They list the
1GHz Encore ST for $210.22. They have the 1.2 GHz for $272.97. I
bought my Sonnet 1.4 GHz from Sparco recently ($363) and it got to me
in one day from the warehouse in Dallas. I have ordered many times
from OWC and always gotten good prices and service as well.


I don't know if this is appropriate to this forum; I looked for
posting guidelines but I could find none. Anyway, I have listed the
933 MHz processor from my Quicksilver 2002 on eBay, auction #
5153402292, if anyone is interested.


If this is inappropriate, please point me to the posting guidelines
for my enlightenment. 

Thanks,

Mel

Thanks to several on this list that recommended a processor upgrade. I

purchase the Other World Computing (OWC) Mercury Extreme 1 GHz
processor.

The shipment and sales support was great and the installation was a
snap.

The old G4 is much more responsive now and I see less spinning discs.
The

big change was noted in iPhoto and that change alone was worth the
cost of

the upgrade.


 Yes, I would like to have a new G5 but the old G4 is still doing a
great job

for everything I need. Thanks guys for the tip to breath new life in
G4.
