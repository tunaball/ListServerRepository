I'm using a DDM G4 and I installed a DVD drive and didn't have a
problem at all, worked from the time that I installed it. Only thing I
had to do was remove the face plate on the DVD so that it would slide
through the door. Also in case you don't know it, if you hold down the
"Option Key" and press the "Eject Key" that will open & close the new
DVD door. I found this out buy trial and error! 


Hope this helps you !
