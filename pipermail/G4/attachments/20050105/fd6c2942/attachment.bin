shouldn't matter.


i have a G4/500/AGP sawtooth and have been running Panther since it
came out (along with previous OSX versions).  I have not had any
issues with lock up like that.  Do you have any 3rd party PCI/AGP
cards loaded that haven't been updated?  Also, have upgraded the OS X
to the latest version or are you still on 10.3.0?  


One other thing you might try is to clear your NVRAM using the prom
monitor.  I might have some detail for this as I did it long long ago
for another issue...


If you have other PCI cards, try pulling them out or checking the
vendor for a ROM update (I know I had to get an update for my Sonnet
SATA card before it would work right)...

downloaded the firmware update listed under the Panther chart for that

new 512 chip from OWC in one slot on one end and a 128 in the first on
the other end (4 slots - with the chips in the outside slots).  All
the memory is recognized.</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>
