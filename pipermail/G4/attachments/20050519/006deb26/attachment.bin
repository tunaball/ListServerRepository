Thanks for all those suggestions. 

Toast 6 with CD Spin doctor looks like it might do me well. Guess I'll
have to pony up the cash, but I'm still sorting thru the reviews.


I did find a couple of people who said that CD Spin doctor didn't work
very well as a filter, but it wasn't clear to me the basis for their
comments. My aging ears won't hear most of the things they talk about. 


For any who may be interested, I did find a huge archive of
discussions on this subject at MacInTouch. There are three long
sections and they can be accessed thru this address. Links will take
you to Parts one and two. It began in 2003 and the latest contribution
is recent 2005. Geek warning: For my simple needs it is like drinking
from a fire hose, but there seems to be a lot of very informed opinion
there. Many of the contributors seem to be professionals in this area.
