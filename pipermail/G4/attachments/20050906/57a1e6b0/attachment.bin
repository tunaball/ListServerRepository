FYI - Java should be 1.4.2_05 if you are at least on Panther (not sure
what it is on Tiger).


You can open Applications/Terminal and use the <bold>java
-version</bold> command.  It will give you the java version info.  The
update is available on the Apple website...

<excerpt>The Sarari update 1.3.1 has arrived on my computer. I have
heard a lot of

stories that it is slower than the current version and some people are

wanting to return to the original if they can.


Are there happy story's out there? People who find the update better?
How

should I go about things if I might decide to return to the original?

I agree, Safari has quite a few limitations, sometimes I have to use
Firefox, or Opera or some other application to get what I want done,
however I still like Safari best.


Do you have Java 1.4.1 installed?

I'm not sure that it will be listed if you do a software update.
