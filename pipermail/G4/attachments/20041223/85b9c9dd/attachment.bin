I have a Power Mac G4 AGP 450 and want to add some more memory as the
current 384 mb is just not enough anymore. I know Apple suggests using
<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>PC-100 Synchronous DRAM
(SDRAM), 3.3 volt, 64-bit wide, 168-pin module, Unbuffered.


Question is this, can I use PC-133 instead of PC-100? If so, would it
matter if the current installed memory (3 x 128 mb) is PC-100? Has
anyone else tried this? Any problems?


Thanks for your help and Happy Holidays.
