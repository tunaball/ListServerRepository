Here is another thing you can do to help speed up Safari. It helped me
quite a lot and I don't like turning JavaScript on and off. I left
caching in the 1.4.2 module on so I will have to manually empty it
periodically I guess but it took several months to get gummed up.


<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param> Go to your utilities
folder/java there are icons that are "Java 1.4.2 Plugin Settings" and
another that reads "Java 1.3.1 Plugin Settings" double click on each
of them. A window will pop up with"general/cache/certificates" click
on the "cache" and click on the clear button. Do this for both java
settings. This is from another forum and they said to Repair
permissions and restart.


Happy and speedy browsing.
