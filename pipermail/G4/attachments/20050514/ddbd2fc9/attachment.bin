<excerpt>The tip from Rich Northouse was a good suggestion. Your G4
detects a power

failure and as soon as there is power it restarts.  That could be your

problem. Rich, where is the setting or preference for auto restart?


I had the same problem with my G4 1GHz AGP under Mac OS 10.3.9.  I
would do

a normal log out and shut down and a few minutes later it would
restart on

its one.  After the shut down and before the restart I would turn off
the

power strip to make sure it would not come back alive.  I never did
figure

out what was causing the problem. The good news is since going to OSX
10.4

the problem is history.  It works normal now.

Rich,


You can set up a Mac to automatically power up, in case of power

failure, etc.. Often used when the machine is in a critical application

such as a server. Thats my guess.

<excerpt>I understand what you are saying, If I shutdown using the
drop down

menu like everyone else, it comes to a stop the light goes off and

then it starts a reboot without touching anything. It's as though you

choose the "Restart" option. I was using the on/off button under the

speaker as a last resort. I've been using Macs for the last ten years

and never ran across this before.


Hope someone has the answer !
