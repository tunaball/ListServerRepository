I understand what you are saying, If I shutdown using the drop down
menu like everyone else, it comes to a stop the light goes off and
then it starts a reboot without touching anything. It's as though you
choose the "Restart" option. I was using the on/off button under the
speaker as a last resort. I've been using Macs for the last ten years
and never ran across this before.


Hope someone has the answer !

I just purchased a used G4 Mirrored Door Power Mac 1.25 GHz, The
problem I'm having is I can't power it up using the on/off button I
have to power it up from the breaker switch. It also won't shut down
from the on/off button without holding it for awhile and hitting the
"apple" key.

Can't help  with the power up problem. <<sorry> Are you using the big
round button under the round speaker?


I close my system by going to Apple menu ( top left of screen) and
selecting the drop down menu "Shut Down". I have NEVER closed down in
the way you describe.

The box said "Windows '98 or better", so I bought a macintosh.
