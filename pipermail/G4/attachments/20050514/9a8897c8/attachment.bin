Hi everyone,


<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><smaller><smaller>I hope someone out
there can help me with this weird problem. I just purchased a used G4
Mirrored Door Power Mac 1.25 GHz, The problem I'm having is I can't
power it up using the on/off button I have to power it up from the
breaker switch. It also won't shut down from the on/off button without
holding it for awhile and hitting the "apple" key. A little history,
when I was setting this machine up I noticed I couldn't boot-up
without connecting my monitor cable. I'm not sure if this is related.
My thought was could my monitor be conflicting with this G4 and
causing this start-up and shutdown problem. I've "Zapped" the prom,
and repaired the permissions, I don't know what else to do.


If anyone can help, it will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance...Rich  </smaller></smaller></fontfamily>
