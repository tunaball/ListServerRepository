<excerpt>I hope someone out there can help me with this weird problem.
I just purchased a used G4 Mirrored Door Power Mac 1.25 GHz, The
problem I'm having is I can't power it up using the on/off button I
have to power it up from the breaker switch. It also won't shut down
from the on/off button without holding it for awhile and hitting the
"apple" key.

Could you be a little more descriptive as to what you mean by,  and
where the, "on/off" button is? With this info. I hope I (we) can help.

The box said "Windows '98 or better", so I bought a macintosh.
