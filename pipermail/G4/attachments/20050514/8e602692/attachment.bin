Ron and Tim butt heads like so:

I really have to disagree.  The changes in OS X from 10.1 to what I'm
using now, 10.3 are dramatic.  These are not minor upgrades but
entirely new OS's each time.  ......Of course all of my Macs will
support it too, we have two iBooks (a 12 inch 1.2 gig G4 and a 14 inch
1.3 gig G4), a dual 1 gig Quicksilver G4 and the one I'm on now, a G5

<excerpt>I am not saying that we should ignore the upgrades, but that
we should understand that they are not necessarily for everybody
immediately when they are distributed.

What I tend to do is wait 6 months until all the kinks are out. The
reason to do this is partly to be able to keep my work going and not
have to do too much geeky stuff. Yes, my stuff is not always new and
shiny. It's not as much fun to wait, but that's ok. We're all going at
a slightly different speed.


My goal is to upgrade 6 months behind - what actually happens is I get
way behind, as you can see from my sig! That's not good, either!
