Well I ran X on my Sawtooth 350mhz with 256RAM. It was VERY slow but
would have been just as fast as my 400 with the same upgrades. So X
will run on a 350. Also you could get an cheaper processor upgrade
Sonnet makes a 1ghz for $200. Moreover if you time it right to can
pick  up a Epson C86 printer for free after rates at staples or
compUSA just look in your newspaper.
