It's not on the keyboard. It is near the power button on the body of
your computer.

Mine has three buttons. I think the programmers button is the tiniest
of the three.

"Reviving Cube FireWire ports"



"Then I found an obscure post on cubeowner.com which reported a
'programmer's reset' solved the problem for the poster. I tried it,
and voila! I have firewire again. To invoke [the programmer's reset]:
Shut down computer, hold down programmer's button, and press the power
button to start up. If the power light flickers you've done it
correctly."
