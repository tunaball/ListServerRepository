Was that OWC upgrade replacing a single 450 or dual 450?


If it was a dual, how's the speed (i.e.: single processor vs. dual)?

I put an OWC Mercury Extreme 1.33 GHz in my AGP/450 about 6 months
ago.  It has been flawless.  Pure plug-n-play, boots in both OS 9 & OS
X (now 10.3.5) w/out problems.  Cost $375 at the time.
