Margaret I had the same problem for different reasons and the only way
that I found to get out of it was to swap the disk locations.


If you have a G4 Sawtooth I'll guess that you just upgraded to 10.4.6
on your secondary disk, that's the one that is located on top.


Don't ask why but the systems wants to boot to

<excerpt> You don't actually have to move the disk, just disconnect
the ribbon cable from both disks and place the second connector on the
top disk. The second connector is for the primary disk. Then boot-up
and it should come on-line.


Hopefully you can then shut down and reconnect the disks back like
normal and everything will work. If not then just swap the disk
locations.


Worked for me.

<excerpt>I upgraded my system yesterday.

Had been using 10.2.8, and jumped to 10.4.6.

The install went fine, I did an archive of my old system.


The problem happened when I did a restart a bit later -

I got the apple screen, the spinning icon below, but then

the apple turned into a circle with a line across it, (the universal

"no" symbol), and I could not boot up any further.

I restarted from the install disk, verified and repaired permissions

on the volume that I had done the new system install on,

and verified the disk, which disk utility said was fine.


Right now I'm booted into a different hard drive, with my old

system 9.2.2 on it. I got here by holding down the option key

on startup, when all my potential startup systems are paraded

across the screen. My new 10.4.6 shows up there too, but if

I choose it, the same thing happens again. What can the problem be?
