<bold>hi


three questions



1.		In my dual 867 mdd there is two hard drive trays, one mounted at
the inner wall  of the computer and another one  at the bottom 		below
the optical drives.


		Is there any differences between these hard drive connections?  Is
one of them a "main" tray or can I boot from anyone of them?

	

2.		I았e got an hd  (samsung250GB/7200rpm/8M/PATA) that압 been used
inside an external usb/firewire box.  

		Is it possible to use it as an internal hd?


		This drive suddenly just died one day and wouldn앖 mount .

		I았e been wondering if it압 the power supply or the hard drive
itself  that has failed. 

		Well I don앖 know ..but mabe I could check it out and give it try
inside my mdd ?


3		The zip drive box ..can use this space and connector for another hd?





kind regards
