Did you have to give a Mac Address for you computer when signing up 
for DSL.. Some ISP require a Mac Address to ID you Computer. If PC was
the computer that you signed up with then you may have to get a router
and clone the Mac Address of the PC in it.. Then any computer
connected to router will connect.. Other wise your TCP/IP settings may
not be correct and in some cases have to use a fixed IP address.

Going on pure memory with OS 9...


Try checking in the Control Panel under TCP/IP and make sure that 
built-in ethernet is selected and that Automatic DHCP  is selected.
Then it should work after you close and save out of the TCP/IP control
panel.    If that is how your DSL service is set up, like most are 
with {automatic DHCP}...


Give this a shot and see what happens...
