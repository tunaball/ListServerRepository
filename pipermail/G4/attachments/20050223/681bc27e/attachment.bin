<excerpt>I put the CD with no better success - still beeps 3 times. 
I'll have to take it in.  But my problem now is how do I get the Cd
out its my #1 of the Panther install - and I can't be without it.  The
keyboard button doesn't work, the mouse hold down, opened the mirrored
door but don't see a manual eject button - unless I'm missing it. 
Please help.

Thanks, Linda

You could try starting up while holding down the open button.

 There is usually a small hole to one side under the disc tray. Stick
an unbent paperclip in to manually eject a CD.
