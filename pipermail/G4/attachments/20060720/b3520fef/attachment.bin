something about the G3 that would prevent a bootable clone that

No... I'm confused a little. The article talks about more recent or
less

recent but makes no mention of G3 or G4. As my G3 iBook is running
10.3.9,

would that then run on a G4 if it was of an age that it would have been

installed with Panther 10.3.9 when it was new?


The article talks of locating a 'build number' in 'about this Mac' but I

could find no such details in either the iBook or eMac.


I bought the iBook about 6 months ago, but judge it to be several
years old,

but have no way of telling.
