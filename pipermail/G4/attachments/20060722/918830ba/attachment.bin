You might want to get yourself a copy of "applejack" and run it once
in a while.

It will do "pre-binding" clean-up your hard disk, runs repair
permissions and a lot of other things.


You run it for "single use" mode therefore it cleans everything as all
that is need for system operation is contained in memory and nothing
is needed from the HD. If you run disk clean-up from multi-user mode
it can not unmount the disk and complete the necessary functions.


You can find "applejack" using dogpile.com
