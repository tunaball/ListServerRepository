<excerpt>I don't think you'll have major issues. You'll have to check
the jumper settings on the IDE drives. I believe they must be set to
master. Perhaps someone can help us out here.


BTW, what have you heard about Aperture?

Canon for prof. reasons (lots of architecture so I HAVE to have full

Nikon mount).</color>

plus the 4 prong power cable can support at least two or three extra
ide drives.


You can replace the scsi drive, but I personally dont like that idea -
others will disagree.


You can go with firewire - that's what I do now. More portability for
when I travel.


If you're not too comfortable installing an internal drive, I'd take
out the scsi stuff and move to firewire. I think you'll be fine in
Photoshop (have you looked at Aperture or LightRoom (Apple and Adobe
respectively))??

PS/CS-2 addresses most of my issues that were needed in PS/ CS.  I've
heard ugly things about Aperture already and can't imagine that Adobe
wouldn't kick up a better solution to anything that Apple would do in
the (still photography) post-production dept.  Either way, most pros
will still have to use PS for the vast majority of their final color
and retouching, so why add yet another piece to the puzzle?  I think
it's great that Apple dove into the market to serve photogs-- it will
keep Adobe sharp.


What issues might I  incur by having both SCSI and IDE drives
internally?
