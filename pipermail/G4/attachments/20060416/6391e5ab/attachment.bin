<excerpt><excerpt>OK, I can't let this pass.  I am a Jew.  I find this
last bit totally

inappropriate for an email discussion list and highly offensive to me
as a

Jew.  Do you know how many Jews have DIED at the hands of Christians
because

of this *Jesus* stuff?  This discussion list is NOT THE PLACE for your

religious beliefs.  If you had just said 'happy Easter' or some such,
it

would be fine.  But Jesus was never recognized by the Sanhendrin as the

Messiah.  You must all realize that Judaism is MUCH older than
Christianity

and there have been many people who have claimed to be the Messiah,
even

after Jesus!

So, since this is a Mac list and not a Jesus list, lets try to keep in
mind

that not everybody is the same.  There are many religions and many
people of

differing opinions.  So, a simple 'happy Easter' will be fine, but the

quoted material above  is totally inappropriate.

Tim:  Well said!

This is no place for religious outbursts from bleating Christers.

Nor is it a place for inciting comments like yours, Earle.

I agree with Keith, Earle doesn't read and understand very well, the
only religious out bursts that I have seen on this thread is the one
from "Tim Collier"


The original offending message only had, 39 Characters, 6 Spaces, for
a Total of 45 which were 7 Words on "One Line"


Then came the offensive statements from Tim, 702 Characters, 170
Spaces, for a Total of 872 which were 161 Words on "Thirteen Lines"


Now that's what I call a tirade.


And Now I Await all of the

Statements,"</bigger></bigger></bigger></bigger></bigger></bigger></bigger></bigger></bigger></color>
