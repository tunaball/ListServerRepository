<bigger><bigger><bigger>Thanks, Calvin,


I used a Memorex CD-R.  Steve G. suggests that I try Applejack to
repair my permissions.  He swears by it on both his and his wife's
Macs.  Sounds good to me.


If by some chance Applejack doesn't fix the problem, I'll get some
Maxell CD-Rs and try one.


All the best,

Don in D.C.</bigger></bigger></bigger>
