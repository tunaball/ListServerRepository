<excerpt>I don't think the 8500 had an ADC connector, just DVI, VGA,
and S-Video regardless of type.


Also, DON'T MESS AROUND with that firmware clockspeed stuff.  Bad
karma.


Try this on for size instead - a System Pref panel for ATI clock (and
over clocking).

It will also report your current config.  Mine reports as CPU 275 and
Mem 250.


It is FIRMWARE controlled so will likely be the same for everyone sans
those who choose to overclock.

<excerpt>To me, the simplest way to determine this would be to look at
the connectors on the card. If it doesn't have an ADC connector, I'd
say it's probably a PC card. The GeForce 3 card in my Quicksilver is a
flashed PC card, and it only has a VGA connector. That said, it's
performed flawlessly for the past year or so.

find a new 8500 in the retail channel.

<excerpt>Kevin & Jim:


I've been running a Radeon 8500 Mac Ed. in my G4/AGP for 2+ years and
have never had a problem.  I have never upgraded the firmware
(reported as: 113-85710-123).  I believe in the "if it ain't broke,
don't fix it" principle.


<excerpt>I found a number on the card itself that is PN 109-85700-00.

</excerpt>

That's the part number for the printed circuit board.  But since the
same board was used for PC & Mac, it doesn't help.


<excerpt>Is the PC version of the Radeon 8500 sold under a different
name?

</excerpt>

Not really. It was called the " Radeon 8500 64MB" vs " Radeon 8500 Mac
Edition".  The boxes had different graphics.

Mac box:

Interestingly, the PC version is a discontinued product, but the Mac
version is still current product.


<excerpt>A radeon 8500 will show up as R200 in the system profiler of
an apple machine.

</excerpt>

I may be mistaken about this, but I believe that system profiler
simply reports what it finds from the firmware.  So, once a PC card
has been flashed w/Mac firmware, system profiler will report it as a
genuine Mac card.  It can't distinguish further than that.


<excerpt>there is no

real difference except that the PC card had a faster core clock speed

(275 v. 250 MHz).

</excerpt>

I wasn't aware of that.  Depending on how ATI implemented the core
clock, a flashed PC card may or may not still run at 275.


If the clock multiplier is coded in the firmware, then the flashed
card will run at 250.  If it is hard coded on the circuit board, or
w/in another chip, then the flashed card will still be running at 275. 
If it IS a flashed PC card, and still running at 275, that could be
the cause of the problem.


Neither System Profiler or the ATI Utility reports clock speed.  I'm
not aware of any utility that will report video clock.


There's only one clock oscillator on the board, 27 Mhz, same for both
PC & Mac.  It doesn't translate to a very clean multiplier though.


<excerpt>If the card isn't stable in your machine then you might have
gotten a

bum card or perhaps your machine is having a hard time dealing with the

8500 for some other reason.

</excerpt>

Kevin, if you're willing, you can send one of your problem cards to
me, and I'll run it in my machine for a couple of days.


If it's problematic for me, then it's a bum card (or flash).  If it
runs OK for me, then there's an issue w/your computer config.
