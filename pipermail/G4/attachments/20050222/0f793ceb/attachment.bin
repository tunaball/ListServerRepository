with 10.3.5 - digitizing in FCP HD - had a kernal panic.  Restarted
and it just gives me three beeps and three power flashes.  Once I got
it to come up but on the progress bar I got a kernal panic.  Took out
each ram stick, different combinations (have 2 512) no change - just 3
beeps nothing on monitor.  Still same symptoms.  Help! </x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>
