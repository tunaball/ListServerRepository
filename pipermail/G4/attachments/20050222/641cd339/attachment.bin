Apple KB http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=112518 shows
that the 12" RGB display is a single-frequency display at 512x384, and
vertical sync of 60.15 Hz. It was probably made for a specific
on-board video circuit. The 14" Performa Display shows 640x480 at 66.7
Hz, if that is your display. My GeForce 4 Ti has 60 and 67 Hz
settings, so maybe your GeForce 4 MX could sync to them. I don't know
how exact it has to be. You can try to get the old Twin Turbo also,
who know what frequencies it might support.

<excerpt>OK fellow listers - I NEED YOU HELP - PLEASE!!!


I've got a G4/1ghz MP with the stock nVidia GeForce4 MX video card.  I
was using an Apple 17" Studio Display (CRT) with a 17" ViewSonic as a
second monitor.  The ViewSonic bit the dust, and I tried connecting an
old Apple 12" Performa display in place of the ViewSonic.


Needless to say, the 12" just "rolled" and "rolled".  The computer was
trying to use the 12" as the "main" with just a blue background on the
17" Studio.  I could see an image through the rolling but could not
get to the preferences to adjust the "Monitors".  I tried turning the
12" off, but the 17" was still acting like the secondary monitor.


Is it possible to make this work?  If so, how?  Am I S.O.L. with this
setup?  Does anyone have any suggestions?  I'm needing this now, and I
don't have time to go to the computer store for a replacement.


I do have an old TwinTurbo PCI card, and I do have available PCI slot,
could that be an option?

Thanks in advance!
