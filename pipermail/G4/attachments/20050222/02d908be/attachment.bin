Linda,

This Apple KB article
<<http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=58442> says that
three beeps indicate that no installed RAM passes power-on self test.
Did you recently change out your RAM? Do you have any spare RAM you
can use to test? Other than that it may be a motherboard failure of
some sort. If you can get it to boot, use your Hardware Test CD (you
have to start up the machine using the HW Test CD) to help narrow
things down.

Good luck,

Mel

with 10.3.5 - digitizing in FCP HD - had a kernal panic.  Restarted
and it just gives me three beeps and three power flashes.  Once I got
it to come up but on the progress bar I got a kernal panic.  Took out
each ram stick, different combinations (have 2 512) no change - just 3
beeps nothing on monitor.  Still same symptoms.  Help! </x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>
