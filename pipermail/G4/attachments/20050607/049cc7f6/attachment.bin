If you have a 1.25 GHz processor, upgrading to a dual processor won't
get you much.  I was on a singe 400 MHz processor, so this approach
worked for me.  I've read that OS X is optimized for two processors,
but I've also read that only certain programs take full advantage of
the 2 CPU configuration.  An example is Photoshop.


You're probably better off buying a new computer to tide you over to
the Mac with the Intel Octium XIXVIII that is cooled with liquid
nitrogen.

call on

your findings?

I have a MDD G4/1.25 (single)

Is there a dual upgrade path for this model?

I need something to hold me over until my new Intel based 12 Ghz unit

is ready in '09
