Hi Phil


Sorry did not make clear.. We wanted a ethernet to ethernet
connection..  I found a
<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param><x-tad-smaller>MacSense AeroPad Mini
802.11g Ethernet Adapter for Mac/PC</x-tad-smaller><smaller> with
connects via ethernet, but powers the adapter through the  USB port..
I would have preferred a separate power source. Viewing the link on
USB that could be a possible choice. Is there any difference in
performance between USB and ethernet.

<excerpt>Thanks Ron.. I have been able to  figure out some of that the
problem which you mentioned is those Air Port cards are hard to fine
and expensive ... But will have to either look for an external
Wireless adapter which I did find that connects with a ethernet cable

and powered by the USB port, which I would rather have a separate
power source.. If any one has any suggestion for a good external
wireless adapter would appreciate them.

I'm very confused by what you're after here. USB to ethernet, USB to
wireless, an access point or router? If its USB to ethernet here's
someone who has looked into this extensively:
http://www.sustworks.com/site/news_usb_ethernet.html. If USB to
wireless than someone recently mention that D-Link's 802.11G adaptor
worked for them, I and others do not recommend their 80211.b USB
wireless adaptor.
