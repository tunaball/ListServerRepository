Hi!


One step better than a PRAM reset is this:


Hold down "Command-Option OF" when starting up.  This puts the Mac
into "open firmware" mode.


type:  reset-nvram (CR)   [nvram = non-volatile RAM}

<excerpt>          reset-all       (CR)


(CR) = carriage return


You may have to repeat this twice.


This should turn on the startup chime and perhaps fix some other
glitches.



NOTE:  Command-Option PR resets PRAM

             Command-Option OF resets NVRAM

             Command-Option S opens in "single-user" mode


Good luck!

I can't seem to make Safe Boot work, nor can I get the Target Disk
Mode to come up, so I can transfer my old CPU data to my brand new CPU.


All seem to hinge, in one way or another, on getting that start-up
chime!


Do I need to do a PRAM reset?


I think I'll try that anyway, whilst all you folks are considering my
question1  ;-)
