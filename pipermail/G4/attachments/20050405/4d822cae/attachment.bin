Okay so I got a 1.2Ghz Sonnet Encore Processor upgrade about a month
ago. Everything seemed to be working fine but then I started having
Harddrive errors. I figure my HD is going bad so I replace it and
trash the old one. Well, since then I've had to reinstall the system
twice due to multiple "Allocation Overlap (-694)" and "Invalid Extent
Pointer (-408)" issues. 


Has anyone heard of these errors. Micromat says it's a hard drive
issue but It just seems too wacky that the same types of errors are
occurring on both my old and new drives.
