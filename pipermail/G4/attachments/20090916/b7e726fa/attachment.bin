<bold>hello!!

</bold>


<bold>Running G4 800Mhz PowerP with os x 10.3.9.

</bold>

<bold>This has been working great but now I find difficulties with
different tasks on the internet. I Guess my web browser (safari 1.3)
is not up to date any more.


I have been into updating software before including some of the
related trouble u could have to that issue.


The main reason why I keep this old system is that I run old verions
of music software applications like Logic pro 6.4.1  and Pro Tools
6.2.2. via 

digidesign digi 001soundcard..


My main qestion is


</bold>


<bold>What is possible?


What is possible to do with this old machine and yet keep Logic pro
6.4.1  and Pro Tools 6.2.2./digi001?


How far can I go in terms of software updating?

</bold>


<bold>ps Some of you may wonder why I keep such old systems.....and
the answer is ...because I know them Like my own backyard. .. I want
to make music and not spending my time reading manuals...ds



Sometimes I wish for a computer that is like a steinway or a fender
stratocaster. 

A model that´s been around for ages (stays the same ...work the
same...)

The only necessary update is to tune it and put on a new set of
strings once in a while.



I have nothing against development in new technologies for sure.. but
some times I just wish for some work pease.


salute to all who keep these old machines alive
