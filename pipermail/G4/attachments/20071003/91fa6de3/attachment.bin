Look here for ram

I have bought 3 512mb chips from 3 different vendors. I checked their
feedback, return and DOA policies and double checked shipping charges.
I am now running 1-Crucial 256mb  with the 3-512mb chips.


I have 2-256mb chips that I pulled from my G4 AGP Graphics machine
when I added the 512mb chips.

E-mail outside the list if you want more information. If anyone else
is interested let me know.


I am also running an 80Gb  and 160Gb (Recognized as 128Gb) in the
machine and a 250Gb in a firewire external enclosure (recognized as
250Gb). All are Seagate HD's. I have never had the first trouble with
any of them. 80Gb is about 6 years old, 160Gb about 3 years old and
250 Gb less than a year old. I paid around $50.00 each for them on
sale.
