I think the reason Richard's system would not load the software (or
prompted him not to do so) was that they were identical versions and
hence "not newer".


As for dates, I am not too sure about the date integrity of files
(that is I am not sure that the dates are preserved all the
time...though perhaps sometimes they are in Tom's case).  


The there are two dates: create date and modified date.  I have seen
my file dates look strange and compared on two systems it looks more
like when the files were created on this volume than when they were
actually built and put in the install package.  Anyone care to
speculate?


Bottom line, I would use version numbers to track what files you have
and not pay much attention to dates.


Tom - you have an old version of DVD Player if you still have 4.5 on
Tiger, you should do the upgrade.  And if you have an ATI 8500 (like
me) then you might have some compatibility problems with the video
subsystem.  I am standing down to remain on Panther which works ok
(save that 10.3.8 seems to have corrupted the video drivers too but
just causes chop I didn't see in 10.3.5 where I plan to revert to this
weekend).  Plus the 8500 isn't able to take advantage of the new video
system in Tiger - so two strikes there for me.


Richard - you are up to date as you can be for now.

<excerpt> Richard, my version of DVD Player 4.6 says it was created on
July29, 2002 and I just downloaded and updated it two days ago (was
version 4.5)! Don't really understand whats going on here, but my
OSX10.4.1 w/ATI 8500 card doesn't play DVD's without garbage pixels
floating all over the screen.

my DVD Player was up to

one in the installer. I declined the offer to replace mine with an

version.


How do you know the most current version of the Apple DVD Player when
they

both say version 4.6?


Mine say it is Version 4.6 created March 11, 2004 and was last
modified on

May 12, 2005. I wonder if one of the system updates changed it?


Should I replace the DVD Player with the older version or leave it
along?
