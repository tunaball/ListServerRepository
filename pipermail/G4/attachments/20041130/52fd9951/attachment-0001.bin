I was sold on WireTap and used it very successfully for a couple of
years. Then I upgraded to Panther and found that it didn't work any
more.  (But your mileage may vary!) After some searching on discussion
boards I found that some patches exist to deal with the malfunction
caused by the upgrade. But I didn't feel like fooling with them. A
friend, knowledgeable in audio matters, had recommended Audio Hijack
Pro. I tried it and became an instant convert.  I especially like the
timer features that can be used to automatically start and stop
recordings. Particularly handy if you record tracks from Internet
radio stations.


Try it out. The demo can be found at:

price of FREE!  But to me the additional features and sound filters of
AHP were quite worth it!

<excerpt><excerpt><excerpt>_I have an iMic Audio Interface which I
would like to use to capture some speech and use some photo snaps to
make a home movie using iMovie.  I can hook up the iMic and plug a
microphone into it.  If I go to "Sound" and check the audio input, by
tapping on the mic I can see the input levels change.  Hence the sound
is getting in.

BUT  -- what software do I use to capture a hunk of sound and than
save it to a file of some sort, so I can retrieve it in iMovie. What
am I missing??

I was just asking a similar question, and was pointed toward WireTap:
