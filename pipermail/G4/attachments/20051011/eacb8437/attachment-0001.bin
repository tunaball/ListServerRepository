Jim - Still working on this. Booted up from my FW drive, repaired
permissions on my main drive w/ Disk Utility. But alas no joy. Same
symptoms. I'll try the hardware test this weekend after I get my
original install disk.


<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>I downloaded the QT
reinstaller (QuickTime_6.5.2_ReInstaller_for7.0.1.dmg) but
unforntunately it won't let me de-install QT on my main drive. I got a
message that it is only good for deinstallig QT on the boot disk. So
that appears to be a dead end too.


I seem to recall the 10.3.9 update problems but I can't remember
details. I'll have to spend some time at the Apple support site.


Thanks for your help so far.


Cheers,


John

before you do that, have you restarted from the panther disk and
repaired your disk permissions  and disk from the DISK UTILITY (must
startup from the CD first).


You are right, it probably has nothing to do with memory. I can't read
the reports either but I did have similar crash reports for some time
until I replaced the memory. Might be worth a shot.


I have heard of the 10.3.9 update causing quite a few problems.


Try to repair the disk and disk permissions first.


Let me know how it goes


Cheers Jim
