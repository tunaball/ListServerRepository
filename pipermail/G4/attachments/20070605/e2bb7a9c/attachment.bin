</fontfamily> If your not using any special fonts, find the file
"<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param><smaller>com.apple.FontBook.plist"
it should be in your user/Library/Preferences folder.


Then delete the file (move to trash) the restart the platform. When
the OS reboots, it will recreate the file from the installed default
font book.

<excerpt>Hello all,


   Today I seem to be running into a font problem. Its showing up on
certain web pages (like Gizmodo) when I use Safari and even parts of
my news group digests in my email on Netscape. The font looks like
"Year 2000" in the font book. My wife was messing around with some
fonts she downloaded and somehow its affecting these two browsers. Is
there a default font somewhere that these two apps are referencing and
can I reset it? Any suggestion would help! Thanks!


Tom
