I am using a Mac Quick Silver with System 10.3.9. I am in need of what
a guess is called a super drive. What I need to do is burn DVD's to
back up my photo projects (same as I do now with CD's but I do need
the extra size that DVD's offer). I planned to get the Pioneer
DVD-110D Internal DVD±RW ($69.95 @ MacMall). When I called to order it
I was told that MacMall advises getting the MCE Internal DVD±R/RW
drive at $99.95 because it is guaranteed to be Mac compatible and the
Pioneer one is not. Is that sales BS in order to get me to spend the
extra $30.00 as sales guy worked hard at discouraging me from buying
the Pioneer unit, so I purchased neither. Also, am I going to have to
purchase additional software such as Toast in order to use the drive
or does system 10.3.9 recognize that one has a DVD burner installed.
