Doing what you suggest will make the iPod susceptible to all the
viruses that can affect any Windows formatted drive. Some iPods were
accidentally infected at an assembly plant with a Windows only virus a
couple of months ago and Apple apologized for releasing them to public
sales without checking them. Apple offered to repair the iPods if you
took them to an Apple store.


You only need to format an iPod IF you intend to connect it to a
Windows machine. As long as you only use it with a Mac, you don't need
to format it again unless you cause serious problems in operating it
and need to do a hard reset.


Of course it wasn't recognized. Windows machines are not capable of
recognizing anything that is not formatted as a Windows device. It
would not have been permitted to load because of the "alien" system
that is installed on it as a Mac iPod. The same conditions exist with
other devices such as Zip cartridges, floppy disks (remember those?),
flash drives, and memory sticks. If it is formatted as Mac, the
Windows machine won't be able to see it and may ask if you want to
initialize it. Tell it "NO" in big letters if it does ask
