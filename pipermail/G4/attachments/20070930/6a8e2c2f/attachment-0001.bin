<color><param>0000,0000,0000</param>Greetings ( + )!( + ) 


Into my G4 sawthooth, I installed a  PowerLogix AGP 7455@1.2GHz w/2MB
L3 which cost me $167.50 which included a 2 Year PowerLogix/OWC
Warranty, and I'm entirely satisfied.


Loads and runs "Classic" very fast, and if I choose to load the OS
9.2.2 platform it is blazingly fast.
