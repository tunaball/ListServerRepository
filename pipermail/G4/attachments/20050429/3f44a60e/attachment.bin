Good Bye All. I've been a part of this G4 email list for over 2  years
now but I'm moving on.  I sold my last G4 tonight on Ebay. FYI it was
an APG/400. I got $405 for it. 


I'll miss you all very much (sniffle sniffle) If any of you need to
find me I'm signing into the G5 list later tonight. I ordered my new
G5 from MacMall this afternoon... and well... I'm sorry it's just too
hard to continue. Good luck all!
