Hello

I have a G4 dual processor 12.42 MHz. I am moving to a new house and I
will be using one phone line with two different ringing signals. 

One will be the standard phone and the other will be used for the
internal fax modem. 

How can I tell the computer to answer only to the ring dedicated for
the fax? 


I have heard some years ago of a device called "ring decoder". But
nobody here can sell me one or even know what it is. 


Does someone can help me?


Thanks
