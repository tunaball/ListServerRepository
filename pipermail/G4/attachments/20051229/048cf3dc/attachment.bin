<bigger><bigger>Thanks, Ronald, for your solid answers.


When you say you use an external FireWire Box, is that combined with
an external hard drive or is it a separate box?  I am not familiar
with that product.  I guess my Fantom doesn't qualify?  From my
profiler, my Fantom external hard drive:

Yes, the Sony DVD burner is a standalone that can be used either with
VCRs or with the Mac.  Since over the years I have downloaded mpegs,
wmvs, movs etc. on my Mac, I would also like to be able to burn those
onto disc for viewing on my TV.  I experimented with creating an
iMovie and then used Toast to burn it to a CD for a test.  During the
last minute of the 6 minute video I created, there were compression
errors, i.e., white blocks popping across the middle of the screen,
like screen noise.  I definitely don't want that to happen when I copy
my VHS and Beta tapes.  That's why I'm buying a standalone DVD burner
that will connect directly to my VCRs.


I will look for MacTheRipper, thanks.  I won't worry about the DivX
format right now.  What I really want is to transfer my aging VHS and
Beta tapes to DVD format with as high a quality as possible and with
no compression errors, I hope (??).


Your answers have been very helpful.  I'm still unsure about the
external FireWire Box you mention to get the USB 2.0 function.


Thanks!

Don
