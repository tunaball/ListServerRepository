That sounds like a rather straightforward solution.  But other
commenters using cards say they've had trouble.


Ronald mentions using a FireWire Box and I'm wondering if that isn't
perhaps an easier or more reliable solution?  But I need more info on
the box before making a decision.


Thanks,

Don

<excerpt>Yes,


I am using a combo Firewire/USB 2.0 card.

Never had a problem, works with everything I have plugged into it.

It is a off-shore brand that I picked up for $15 at the surplus store.
