Perhaps only Apple, or someone that has worked for apple can tell us,
but the system probably get the time from either WWV, WWVB and WWVH. 


See; http://tf.nist.gov/


These are the official web sights of the US Government that maintain
and broadcast the primary time signal for the everyones use. They us a
Galleon Atomic Clock as the source for time keeping.

beat me to it."
