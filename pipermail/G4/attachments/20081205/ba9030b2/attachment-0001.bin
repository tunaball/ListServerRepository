Hi,


I enjoy going to online newsgroups,

learning and contributing to discussions.


However, for some reason,

I am getting each E-Mail sent to the G4 list

sent to my e-mail (xplorations@earthlink.net)

which I DON'T WANT.


I didn't even join this particular discussion ( ! ? )


Can you tell me where to go (so to speak)

to change this so it doesn't keep happening.


Thanks,


Vic

</fontfamily>Thanks for your response, Harry. It seems that I have no
worries.
