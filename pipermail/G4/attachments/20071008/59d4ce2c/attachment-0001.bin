Sure John, it's easy, when you bring up "Disk Utility" click on help
and then in the help box type "Partition" and you get the help menu
for Partitioning a drive, some of which I've included below. However
you will be required to reformat the drive, so if you have any
information on the disk it will be wiped clean.


<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param><smaller><smaller><smaller>	1
	Start up your computer from a Mac OS X Install CD or an external hard
disk with a System folder.

	2 	Open Disk Utility, located in Applications/Utilities. (If you
start up from a Mac OS X Installer CD, choose Installer > Open Disk
Utility.)

	3 	Select the disk that you want to partition in the left column .

	4 	Click Partition.

	5 	Choose the number of partitions from the Volume Scheme pop-up menu.

	6 	Click each partition and type a name for it, choose a format, and
type a size (you can also drag the partitions to change the size).

	7 	Select the option to Install Mac OS 9 Drivers if you will use the
partition as a Mac OS 9 startup disk. (You do not need Mac OS 9
drivers to use Classic.)

	8 	Click Partition, then click Partition again.</smaller></smaller></smaller></fontfamily>

<excerpt>This comes up all the time! Has anybody actually done

it, rather than imagining it?


I put a 160Gb drive in my Gigabit Ethernet and under

10.3.9's Disk Utility it would only recognize it as a

128Gb. How can I partition it, if it's only recognized

as 128Gb? In truth I don't really care since 128Gb is

more than enough and if I really wanted more I'd just

buy another disk.

<excerpt>If it won't format beyond a single 128 GB partition,

I imagine it's

possible to make two partitions in order to take

full advantage of the

drive's capacity. The goal there would be to use the

entire drive up

with the two partitions, however large you make the

two of them. The

default is simply to cut the drive in half.
