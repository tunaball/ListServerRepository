Hi Dan,


I also have a G4 MDD and went through a lot of problems with shutting
down and sleeping. I am using a VGA monitor that I had with my other
G4 "Yikes" and tried using it with my new (to me) G4 MDD but I
couldn't get it to shutdown or sleep without powering down with a
power strip. I found out by purchasing a ADC to VGA Extractor adapter
I now have solved all those problems. Hope this is of some help to you
and anyone else who have VGA monitor problems.
