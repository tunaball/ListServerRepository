Perry you should contact OWC Technical support @
http://eshop.macsales.com/tech_center/index.cfm

You can not always trust Apple regarding up-grades because they want
to sell you a new Mac. and don't want you to make your old one better.


I installed the 1.2GHz from PowerLogix about 3 months ago and
everything is working just fine, however I haven't up-graded the
platform to 10.4 because I haven't found anything in 10.4 that I need
therefore it would only be a feel-good up-grade.

on OS

10.3.9


My question is whether I can now install Tiger? The OWC site (who sell

PowerLogix) clearly say compatible with OS 10.4 but the Apple site
clearly

says that OS X is not compatible with processor upgrades!

Before I lay out the UKP89 (that's about $180!) for the retail version
of

Tiger, I wanted some reassurance from somebody that it would really
work?


I have access to an OEM version of Tiger sold with a G5 that I was
hoping to

use to test the system, but it won't load on the G4.
