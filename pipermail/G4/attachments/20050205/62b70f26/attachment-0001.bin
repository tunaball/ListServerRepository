I don't know if I'm way off here, but aren't the Apple LCD monitors
made by Samsung?  If not, who are they made by?  And, if not Samsung,
shouldn't you look at what that company has to offer as far as their
own branded monitors is concerned?

<excerpt>I guess what I was looking for was if their were any third
party DVI alternatives to Apple's no longer made 17" ADC LCD Studio
Display. I see different manufactures at the Mac online retailers, as
well as reviews in some of the Mac magazines, but I'm looking for a
personal perspective of y'all's experience. Of ones that I see that
have a digital connection, are their particular companies I should
stay away from because their product and/or service quality is
terrible? Looking in one of my current Mac catalogs, I see the
following vendors (besides Apple, since a $999 20" is their entry
level) that have digital LCDs - ViewSonic (I've had good luck with
their CRTs), Planar, NEC/Mitsubishi, Sony, LG, Princeton, Samsung &
Arcadia? Anyone have any "bad luck" and/or customer service with
digital LCDs from any of these particular companies? Actually, my
"secret wish" is that the 17" wide screen that is available in the
iMac G5 could be made available as a standalone DVI LCD at or below
the price of the old ADC 17" Apple Studio Display.

I love my 17" Apple Studio Display LCD on my G4 Tower at work, and was
wondering if their are any DVI capable LCDs that y'all like that are
in a similar price range or less than Apple's $699 (US$) price of
their 17" LCD?

Apple no longer has the 17" LCD at their web site.  I did not see any
at the local Apple Store.


There have been recent reviews on 17" LCD displays in various
magazines.  Try Macworld, PC World, PC Magazine on line.  Also
Shopper's World (CNET).
