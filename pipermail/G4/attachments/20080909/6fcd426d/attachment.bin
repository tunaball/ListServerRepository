Try trashing the prefs file.

In one of the library/prefs folders.

Hi James,

Thanks for replying.  I trashed as many prefs as I could find.  No

At this point, Safari itself may have been corrupted.  After looking

at the Console logs as suggested by another responder, you might try

reinstalling Safari from the OS X 10.3.x Panther media.  Or download

the latest version that works with Panther from Apple.


By the way, do you recall making any changes before the crashing

began?  Any other incidents?
