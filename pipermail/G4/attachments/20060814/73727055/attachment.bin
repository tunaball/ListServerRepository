Greetings ( + )!( + )


I've switched over to "Camino" which is almost like "Safari" however
it is more than twice as fast, and since switching I haven't had to
watch the "Dreaded Spinning Beach Ball"!!!

<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> Has one of these plug-in's 
corrupted my QT? I've tried re-installing QT, Un-install VLC and
re-set Safari. (It also happens in Firefox).</fontfamily>

with Internet Explorer. ANY SUGGESTIONS?</fontfamily>

<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> I was having niggling things to do
with displaying Flash images in Safari, had problems with some
websites requiring me to press buttons twice to work, and so on. I got
sick of it and a couple of weeks ago migrated all my bookmarks over to
Netscape, and am finding browsing much more fun now, and trouble free. </fontfamily>


<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> Netscape is an ugly beast, and
Safari was my favorite for organizing bookmarks, but in the end it has
to work well. Firefox is prettier to look at, but I was already using
Netscape for editing websites... So practicality won.</fontfamily>


<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param> If Harry’s suggestion for trashing
the plist file doesn’t help I would suggest Firefox or Netscape for
your default browser.</fontfamily>
