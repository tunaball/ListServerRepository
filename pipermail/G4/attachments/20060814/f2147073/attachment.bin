<excerpt>Something strange has happened. I have Quicktime Pro and when
I go to view something in Safari I get a "No picture" error in the
Window. I have Flip 4 Mac & VLC as well/

Has one of these plug-in's  corrupted my QT? I've tried re-installing
QT, Un-install VLC and re-set Safari. (It also happens in Firefox).

The strange thing is that it works with Internet Explorer. ANY
SUGGESTIONS?
