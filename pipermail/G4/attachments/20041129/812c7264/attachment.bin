have an iMic Audio Interface which I would like to use to capture some
speech and use some photo snaps to make a home movie using iMovie.  I
can hook up the iMic and plug a microphone into it.  If I go to
"Sound" and check the audio input, by tapping on the mic I can see the
input levels change.  Hence the sound is getting in.</x-tad-bigger><x-tad-bigger>

BUT  -- what software do I use to capture a hunk of sound and than
save it to a file of some sort, so I can retrieve it in iMovie.  What
am I missing??


thanks
