If you have QuickTime Pro it will also record and edit audio.

</x-tad-bigger><excerpt><x-tad-bigger>_I have an iMic Audio Interface
which I would like to use to capture some speech and use some photo
snaps to make a home movie using iMovie.  I can hook up the iMic and
plug a microphone into it.  If I go to "Sound" and check the audio
input, by tapping on the mic I can see the input levels change.  Hence
the sound is getting in.

BUT  -- what software do I use to capture a hunk of sound and than
save it to a file of some sort, so I can retrieve it in iMovie.  What
am I missing??


thanks
