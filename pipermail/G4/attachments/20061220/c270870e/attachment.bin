<excerpt>Hello,


 I am driving a Mac MDD DUAL 1.25 MHz / 2 GB RAM / 320 GB HD / OS
X.4.8 with an HP 5510 All In One Printer Scanner Fax attached with a
USB cable.


 Strange problem - I was trying to print a  homemade certificate that
I made using a “grayed” drawing with the words overlaid.


 It seems to print fine EXCEPT that the drawing is a light bluish
green - NOT gray and I can find no way of telling it to Print In Gray
scale.  Also when I try to print color images the colors DO NOT match
the image?


 I have changed the color and black inks several times to no avail. 
HELP!
