I read in Macworld that Appleworks is going bye bye.


Sort of a problem for me because I need it for budget and for when
Windows users send me Word docs. That's sort of all.


I also notice that Maclink seems to not work at present. ???


What are you all doing about Appleworks? I could just keep on using it
forever except if new versions of Word don't open, I am sunk.


Not interested in buying MS product right now, humph. Don't really
use. Would buy Quicken for the budget. (Although I like the simplicity
of the spreadsheet.)
