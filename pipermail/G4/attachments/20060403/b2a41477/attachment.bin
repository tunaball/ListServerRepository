<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><color><param>0000,0000,0000</param>I
have a g4 450 dual running 10.3.9. I have two drives with 2 and 3
partitions on them.  Drive number 2 is 3 months old.

I installed a "Creative I/O" 1394 + usb 2.0 combo card to replace my
non-functioning firewire ports and add usb 2.0 to my machine. The
machine wouldn't sleep, but all else functioned fine. Now 1 partitions
on each drive isn't appearing on my desktop. I see them in disk
utility but they are grayed out and I can't repair them. I get
"<bold>Error: The underlying task reported failure on exit (-9972)". 

</bold>I removed the PCI card and still have the same problem.  I had
almost this exact same problem with another drive 3 months ago (before
the card). I am thinking that it was the pci card but now I'm
wondering if it could be something else? Help is greatly appreciated
this machine is my workhorse.


Thanks,
