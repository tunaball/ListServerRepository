1) Open your System Preferences file and click on System Accounts.
Select your account then select "Startup Items.


2) Then record all of the items that are part of the star-up sequence
and start removing the unneeded 3rd party items one at a time until
you find one that might be causing your problems.


or


2a) Remove all of the unneeded 3rd party items and if that fix's your
"freezing" replace 1/2 of the 3rd party items that were removed. If
your "freezing" problem doesn't return then replace 1/2 of the
remaining items, and so on and so on until the offending item is
isolated.


3) If the problem returns then remove 1/2 of the items that were
returned to see if the problem goes away, if it does then return to
the start up list 1/2 of those that were removed to see if the problem
returns.


This is a long process because it requires a restart after each
removal to see if the "freezing" is gone and/or has returned.


Once you have found the problem, perhaps placing it in a different
position in the list will fix the "freezing" problem.

My Mac has begun to freeze intermittedly. It seems to occur in any
application when I am simply moving the mouse. I have run Disk
utilities several times yet the problem continues. Any insight to this
problem would be greatly appreciated.
