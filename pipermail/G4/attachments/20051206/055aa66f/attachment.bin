<excerpt>Greetings,

I am new to the list and a new Mac owner. I was told that Macs are
best for audio recording work stations, so I got a G4 450 running OSX.
I am trying to record audio in stereo but I am pretty sure the input
is only mono. I have a  sound blaster usb external sound card that I
want to connect and run but I have no idea what I am doing with this
Mac computer. I have used a pc since I started using computers. When I
connect the sound blaster and go to the system info it says sound
blaster extigy but I don't know how to install the software for it.
And it is not operating. The cd is set up for windows (PC). I guess I
need a crash course on using Mac operating systems. Any help would be
appreciated!

Thanks in advance,

Kenny
