Hello G4 Friends,


I just today installed a Belkin F5U220 USB 2.0 PCI card in my
Quicksilver 2002, 800MHz computer.

I purchased it from the Belkin web site for $34.99 plus tax and
shipping.

It went in easy and everything worked right away,  Epson C86 printer,
Fantom 120GB Ext HD and Sprint DSL Modem.

I have not noticed anything that is not working the same as before it
went in.
