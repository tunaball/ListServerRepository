For a coupla years now I've noticed that either me or the keyboard has
a tendency to CApitalize both the first and second letters of a word.
This usually occurs when I'm typing fast and hit the shift key. WHen I
proof (ie look away from my fingers) is when I notice the double
capitalization. I have never fully understood why this happens. But
since I don't have to make a living at my keyboard I can deal with it
by going back and changing the case.  I don't *think* it's
<underline>me,</underline> but it could be!  My fingers do not hover
over the keys nor do I seem to be holding the shift key down longer
than I "should". 


Now just in the last week or so corresponding with the upgrade to OS
X.3.8, and the simultaneous installation of the MS Office for OS X,
all of a sudden I'm having trouble with the insertion of 1 tp 3 extra
spaces whenever I hit the space bar.  Again this happens when I'm not
looking and it doesn't happen all the time. But recently it's
occurring once or twice in each line of text. It happens both in MS
Word as well as in Mail app.  


I'm loathe to believe that this really could be caused by the software
change. Maybe it's the typist that's failing more than before.... but
I don't think so. 


 I beginning to wonder if this is the typical behavior of a keyboard
that's beginning to fail. Unfortunately I don't have a spare to swap
with.


Keyboard is an early MacSense USB. When my Sawtooth came out this
keyboard was the only alternative to the Apple standard issue.  It's
been fairly reliable for the last five years.


Is this what a failing keyboard might look like? 


Thanks,
