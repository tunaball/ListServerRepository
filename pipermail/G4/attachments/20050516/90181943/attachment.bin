Yes.  Chances are your linksys router is set to be a DHCP server
(meaning it assigns addresses to your machines).  You can keep this
set up most likely as the linksys will not likely change any of those
IPs without some change in your network (e.g., new machines being
added, etc) and even then chances are you will still get the same
address.


To set up an FTP server, you will need to configure the linksys
router's "port forwarding".  Essentially it means you will tell it
that port 21 needs to be sent to your G4's IP.  (You can get your IP
on the G4 by opening the the System Preferences->Network panel).  It
will likely be something like 192.168.x.y or similar.


Once you set linksys to port forward port 21 to your G4 IP, then you
will need to check the Sharing Preferences panel and enable the FTP
check box on the services page (this will also open port 21 on your
firewall).  To test if you have successfully forwarded your machine,
you can get your external IP address using any number of tools
(http://dslreports/whois) and then you can go your mac, open a
terminal window (or your PC using "cmd" for that matter) and type:


<bold>ftp <<the external ip address that WHOIS told you is yours></bold>


once you hit enter, you should get to a you should get some response
back asking for a login/password similar to this:


Connected to localhost.

220 localhost FTP server (tnftpd 20040810) ready.

Name (localhost:pacyga): 


I suggest you download <bold>PureFTPd Manager 1.4.4</bold> from a site
like http://versiontracker.com.  This tool helps configure some of the
hidden bits and will let you configure things like hidden FTP user
accounts and anonymous FTP (not that you would want to do that
necessarily).


I have used it and it works fine.
