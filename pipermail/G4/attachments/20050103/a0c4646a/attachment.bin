I am hoping that ya'all can help me. We have a G4 running on OS 10.3
and the computer seems to be working fine but our internet and email
does not work properly all the time. Sometimes it is good some times
it is bad. We did all the trouble shooting things. Talking to the IP
tech out uploaded and downloaded numbers seem to be not meshing. (See
below) and he says that it could be a virus. Wondering if anyone else
has any ideas or thoughts on this problem. I just am real
uncomfortable thinking it is a virus.
