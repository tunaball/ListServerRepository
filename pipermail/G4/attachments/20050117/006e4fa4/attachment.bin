What software do you use most? Do you use Photoshop or Final Cut,
which recognize two processors and can take advantage of them, or do
you need speed for games or general applications. If the former, go
for the dual, since those applications will make good use of the
second processor. If not, stick with the single, since you wouldn't be
getting much our of the second one.
