I'm a Graphic artist. I use all of Adobe's creative suite as well as
Flash, Dreamweaver, and MS Office... mostly. Oh and all of the iLife
apps except for GarageBand. No games here just hard work. Yes I'm a
dull boy.


I was also thinking of getting a new Graphic card but I don't want it
to replace my existing 2 cards. But instead would like to add a 3rd
monitor. so the card needs to fit into  a PCI slot. and
recommendations that too?
