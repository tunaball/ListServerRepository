Just wanted to let everybody know how I've been able to fix my own
problem.  Apparently, in the Onyx application there was a selection
for a hidden Exposé feature to "minimize desktop".  I unchecked that
and everything's back to normal now. :)

Nope, didn't work...


Thanks for trying, though! :)


Anyone else care to weigh-in?

shrink down to a small thumbnail in the lower right corner of the
screen!  Before this, all windows would simply whisk off to the nether
regions beyond the desktop borders.  Anybody ever come across this? 
And how do I get it back to normal?


Todays lesson:  drinking & computing should be avoided. *hehehe*
