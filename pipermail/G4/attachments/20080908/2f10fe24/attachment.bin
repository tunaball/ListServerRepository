Try trashing the prefs file.

In one of the library/prefs folders.

<excerpt>Hi Folks,

Yesterday, Safari 1.3.2 started crashing at every launch attempt. I

tried a restart, fixed disk & permissions with Disk Utility, ran

Cocktail, and rebuilt the directory with Disk Warrior.  I tried to

launch between each utility but no luck. I created a new account and

restarted, nothing.  Permissions, caches, and anything else Safari I

could think of were dumped, still zilch. I tried to dump the plug-

ins from the smbl folded, but could only find one, taboo, and that

didn't help.  Only Finder was running during each test launch.

Any help would be appreciated.


This is on a G4 AGP 400, OSX.3.9, 1.25Gb ram, 120 & 70 Gb HDD, lots

of other stuff.


tia,

Hi James,

Thanks for replying.  I trashed as many prefs as I could find.  No
effect!!  Still looking for an answer.
