I install publishing systems for large ad agencies and publishing
company and I have yet to see a flat panel last more then 3 years. It
seems like a <fontfamily><param>Helvetica</param>huge chunk of change
for such a short period of time. I still have a 9 year old Hitachi
RastorOps that works great.


Hopefully the new Apple HD displays won't burn out as quickly.  </fontfamily>
