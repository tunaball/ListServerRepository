Java doesn't affect plugin performance for things like multimedia. 
Plugins like QT or REAL are generally the things that handle content
like that.


I've had some issues with Safari quitting on mundane things like

I have tried everything I could, including all of the security updates

upgraded to 10.3.9 or perhaps 10.3.8 some months ago.

Like Cocktail or Yasu?
