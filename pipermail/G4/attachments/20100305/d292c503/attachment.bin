<excerpt>I think the ADC monitors are very good. Sharp image and true
colours. I've recently bought 3. My only concern is that they are
quite fragile and you need to make sure they are shipped very
carefully or better still, go and (test then) collect.


The only known issue I'm aware of is that the backlight can fail, and
I'm told that a knock in transit can cause this.


The problem is that the cost of repair is often higher than the cost
of the monitor.


So I have perfect 17" and 20" ADCs that I tested and collected and a
17" that I had delivered by post; it failed, sent it back, it worked,
it failed...now on eBay uk as a 'spares or repairs!'


Hope this helps!

I have found some of these for sale at very good prices.

I´m thinking of maby get me two of these.   '

But at wikipedia it says there were some issues about these that I
don´t understand.  


Is there anything I should be worried about in this matter?
