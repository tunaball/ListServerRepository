I was disappointed to find that most PCI cards will cause deep sleep
problems. xlr8yourmac.com has some reports on the site, and it seems
that virtually all USB and FireWire cards cause trouble with deep
sleep, either preventing it or putting CPUs into comas. I had a
FireWire card that would not allow my Quicksilver 2002 to go into deep
sleep. I emailed OWC's tech support about it at the time and they
responded that they did not know of any FireWire cards that did
support deep sleep. Hubs it will have to be.
