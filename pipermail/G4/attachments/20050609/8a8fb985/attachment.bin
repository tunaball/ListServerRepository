<color><param>267F,3A92,FFFF</param>Trashing is the least of your
worries (deleting a file owned by root is

no big deal as long as you have admin privs, just use Terminal.). Why

do you have 6 copies of the same panel? What actions have you performed

to get there?


When you say "trash", do you mean, (a) trying to remove the panel in

System Preferences, or, (b) trying to trash the file

/System/Library/PreferencePanes/Localization.prefPane in Finder?</color>


Thanks for the responses

I have no Idea what I did to make the extra copies of the
international panel besides trying to delete the file from
/OSX/share/emacs/21.1/lisp/international, in Finder. This is when I
get the root file warning. I don't have a emac!


I'd like to get rid of (trash) the 5 copies and leave one on the
system preference panel. One is in the "personal row" of the panel and
5 are in the "other" row. 

OS9 was sooo much easier!
