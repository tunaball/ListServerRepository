Dear Mike, first of all make sure that your computer supports dual. I
own a Sawtooth 450 and it doesn't accept dual processor, dig further
as Gigabits do accept them. May be yours is one of them. Also, you can
work it out at

Good luck.


Jose.

Hi All....


I just picked up a G4 Sawtooth 500Mhz, and added 1.5Gb of RAM and
160Gb if

of disk and a Radeon.


Interestingly enough it's been pretty cheap so far. Having said that
it's

time for a new processor.


I've been looking at OWC and have seen a few that should do the trick.
Now,

for the big question...


Single or Dual?


Looks like I can get a dual for just a bit more than a single, see
here;

What are the groups thoughts? 1.2Ghz Dual or 1.8 Single?


I use this machine for image editing and I am plannig on doing some
iDVD

work now.


TIA


Mike
