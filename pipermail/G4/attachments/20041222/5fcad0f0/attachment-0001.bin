I'm not having the problem with slow eBay searches in Safari (or
slowness in general), but recently I have been using Camino
<<<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param><smaller>http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/></smaller></fontfamily>
a lot. They have fixed most of the previous annoyances and it is quite
fast for me. It's not as fully featured as Safari, so I still use
Safari some, but I really like Camino now. You might give it a try.

<excerpt>Hello,


Emptying the cache and icon file did nothing to speed Safari up with
Ebay searches. Safari speed did not help either.


I turned off Javascript, and ebay searches seem to work fine now!

Thanks,

David

Another thing you can do is delete the Safari Icon folder. Go to
Library/Safari and delete the icons folder. Restart Safari. If this
folder gets too big it can take longer for Safari to look up the icon
than to just reload it. Some empty it regularly along with the cache
and deleting the history.


A real speed up for ebay is to turn off JavaScript by going to
preferences/security and uncheck the check box. This will help you
surf ebay really fast but will limit some of the functions. You can 
check and uncheck this at will.

am not the only one with this issue! Ebay is especially bad - I

thought maybe it was just holiday traffic, but Internet Explorer is

MUCH faster. I guess I'll try Firefox.

<excerpt>This is the problem I've been having! I just posted the
question

about command line code (sudo) & how to use it, hoping it would

address this issue- it has not. So I just added an additional gig of

Crucial Ballistix Ram PC4000 to my MDD 867, and now have a total of

1.75Gigs of RAM- I see a difference, but Safari is still

Colorwheeling & getting hung up on itself as it tries to load pages.

How do you manually empty cache without downloading one of these

automating programs?  I'd like to try to keep things simple, if that

will address the issue.

Thanks all- Jim.

look for

it at  <<www.versiontracker.com>


It might help!

<excerpt> Hello All-

 Anyone have an extreme Safari speed loss with 10.3.6? It hangs at Htt

 & there's a delay in clicks on links before the toolbar even

 highlights (you know, the address in the toolbar.I'd go to 10.3.7 but

 I'm worried about the slow starup problems reported.

 Thanks, Melissa
