Fred,

You are experiencing a Kernel Panic, also known as a System Crash,
with the dual processor installed. Carefully check that the dual
processor card was properly seated during installation. Do a cold
start and wait to see what appears.


If the problem persists and you continue to get the Kernel Panic
window, shut down and remove the dual processor card and put back the
original processor chip to see if that cures the problem.


If the problem window doesn't appear, you are golden and can go on
about your business of learning how to use a Macintosh.


If the problem persists, you have some problem other than one being
caused by the change of processor chips.


If you have the OS-X installation CD, start the G4 and immediately
insert the CD while holding down the "C" key on the keyboard. When the
startup dialogue window gets to the point of asking what type of
installation you want, select "Erase and Install" to get a fresh
installation of the operating system on your drive. After doing a
fresh install of the OS, you can install any other programs that you
want as long as they are Macintosh compatible and will run in OS-X.


This is the simplest way of getting your machine up and running
without carrying any old problems forward with you. There are other
installation methods, but it would take a longer message to describe
them to you and the message might not be permitted on this bulletin
board because of length.


If you have other questions, ask away. There are always people out
here who can and are willing to help.</x-tad-smaller></fontfamily>
