If you are curious about processor upgrade cards, check out the
compatibility database on http://www.xlr8yourmac.com 


As for the modem, you can check under the "<italic>AppleMenu->About
This Mac->More Info (button in About panel)"</italic> - this will
launch Profiler (assuming you are running a recent OS X).


In profiler, select Hardware->Modems from the side nav.  If you have
one, it will detail its type.


As for 802.11 cards.  I dropped my Airport 11b card in my G4/500 for a
Sonnet 802.11g Aria Extreme.  It works flawlessly (actually better
than the airport card - no interference to the USB ports when
transferring data).  It is also pretty good and fast.  From my LAN, I
can transfer 300Mb in about 3 minutes (v. about 12-13 for airport
card).

<excerpt>Hi all 


I just got a Dual 867 MDD model, and want to do a couple of upgrades
to  it. 

Has anyone upgraded their Dual 867 (other model owners jump in too)
with one 

of the aftermarket dual CPU cards, and what was your experience? My
son has a 

dual 867 as well, and I was thinking of giving him my 2100 ram and
putting in 

2700 ram. Is that possible, and would that be advantageous considering
the 

upgrade card? If you don't have any personal experience, web sites
that address 

this would be appreciated as well.


How do I tell if this machine has an internal modem? Under Network
overview 

it says modem, but nothing after that. I tried to dial out but got
nothing. Oh, 

does anyone know if a third party wireless card will work in a MDD, or
is an 

Airport card the only choice? (I want to keep it internal) All
comments would 

be appreciated.


TIA

STeve
