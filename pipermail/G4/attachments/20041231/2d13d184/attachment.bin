<fontfamily><param>Arial</param>But what should you do if have
forgotten your only administrator password? If this is the case, then
this is the time to locate Mac OS X Installer CD. Unfortunately, I was
unable to supply screen shots for the following instructions since I
have to boot from the Installer CD which does not allow creation files
(screen shots, in this case) on a locked volume, so follow these steps
in order to reset the administrator password:

	• 	 1. Boot up from the Mac OS X Installer CD.

	• 	2. Once you have reached the initial Installer screen, select
Reset Password from the Installer menu. This will automatically launch
the Reset Password application.

	• 	3. With Reset Password active, select the Mac OS X volume which
contains the password you wish to change.

	• 	4. After selecting the Mac OS X volume, click on the popup menu
for the admin user that you want to reset the password.

	• 	5. Once you have selected the admin user, type in the new password
that you want in both the "Enter a new password for this user" and in
"Reenter the new password for this user" fields.

	• 	6. Now click on the Save button to save the new password for this
user.

	• 	7. After clicking on the Save button, go ahead and quit the Reset
Password application which will bring you back to the initial
Installer screen.

	• 	8. From the initial Installer screen, select Quit Installer for
the Installer menu.

	• 	9. You will then be prompted on whether you want to quit, select
the Restart button in this dialog to restart your machine.

options for changing it.

That won't work to help the person who submitted the question
originally,

because he cannot get to the Finder desktop (he cannot log in because
he

doesn't know the password). When he boots from the CD he won't have
access

to System Preferences from the Finder. As others have pointed out,
he'll be

able to replace the master password when booted from the CD. Changing
the

password in System Preferences when booted from the hard drive requires

knowing the password to get there (if the password is required to log
in),

and certainly requires knowing the password to change it.
