I bet you guys (girls) don't know what we once called "card readers". 
There use to be machines that knocked chads out of cards.  They were
called "key punch machines" and they were operated by people called
"key punch operators" but if you were an eager programmer and wanted
to skirt the bureaucracy , you usually punched them yourself  . 
That's how we got data into the machines using "card readers" before
PCs.  Thats back in the days of the IBM 7090 with 32,000 word memory
when that was the "big machine".  Thats right, thousand.  I hate to
admit it but that was in the early 60s.  That "card reader"  I
mentioned is one you can avoid.
