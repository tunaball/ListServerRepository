<bigger><bigger><bigger>Hi, Steve.


My Pioneer 110D SuperDrive (purchased Sept. 2005) just went out (I
also used PatchBurn3.1.3en to flash the drive).  Spits out any disc I
put in.  Found out it had gone bad by trying to boot off of my
DiskWarrior disc.  I had been burning DVDs using Toast 7.0.2 until 2
days ago.


My Mac is a 2001 G4 QuickSilver 733, 640 MB ram, OS 1.3.9.  Two
external Firewire drives, LaCie and Fantom.


I am supposing that the Pioneer 111D is a later model than the 110D? 
I always like to get the latest model, and am encouraged that you told
Davis the 111D should work fine.


Your friend,

Don in D.C.</bigger></bigger></bigger>

Good move.


<excerpt>Is this the right thing to do?

</excerpt>

Absolutely.


<excerpt>Will it work with what I now have?

</excerpt>

Yes.


<excerpt>Will my system recognize it?

</excerpt>

Yes.


<excerpt>Is there something else I may have to do or purchase?

</excerpt>

No.  But, if there SHOULD be a problem, download patchburn from
patchburn.de and install it, and that will take care of recognition
problems.  But, you shouldn't need it.


<excerpt>Is there a better way?

</excerpt>

Other than getting a spiffy new Mac, no.
