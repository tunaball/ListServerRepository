Dear Alex

My G4 is a Dual processor 1.42 MHz that was on the market from January
to April 2003, just before G5 release. Sorry about mistyping 12.42...
I am using Panther 10.3.9 and will go to Tiger later this Summer.


<excerpt>If you're using Panther, you want to enable distinctive ring
switching. Essentially, you need to add -SDR parameter to the
initialization string. Check this Macworld article for instructions:

</excerpt>I thank you for your information about the Macworld article.


I will try this as soon as I have move to the new home on May 13th.

<excerpt>I have heard some years ago of a device called "ring decoder".

I believe it's called a distinctive ring switch. Bell used to sell
them for something like CAD 50 -- I'm not sure if they still do. If
they do, I'd use it instead of Panther's software capability -- IMHO,
it's more reliable.

</excerpt>If the software patch does not work satisfactorily, then I
will try to find a distinctive ring switch.


Again thanks for your help
