<excerpt><color><param>0128,0128,0128</param>I have a 400 MHz G4 (AGP)
running 10.2.8.  I can burn regular CD-R's, but I don't see anything
that states "superdrive" in any application.</color>

</excerpt>

The System Profiler:


CD-RW/DVD-R

Disc Burning "not supported"

Unit Number "0"

ATA Device Type " atapi"

Device Serial (blank)

Device Revision "1.06"

Product Identification "DVD-RW DVR-108"

Vendor Identification "PIONEER"


Is this how it should show up? Do I need to install a driver just for
it to be recognized as a "superdrive"?


Thanks for the help

Which computer and which OS?

Toast 6, iTunes and DVD Player should see the drive immediately.

Go to CD/DVD Prefs in System Prefs to set your prefs.

If you are running Panther I believe everything is installed already.

If not, go to the Pioneer website and download the 108 driver.

OK, I've installed a new DVD burner (Pioneer DVR-108). How can I tell

whether I need to download/install a patch or firmware update to make
it

show up as a "superdrive"?


Thanks,

Gary
