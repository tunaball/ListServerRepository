&gt;<i> Help!  I was working on a project on my G4 Digital Audio running Digital Performer 3 on OS 9.2, through a MOTU 2408 Mk II.   I was working all morning, and then I opened a new file before lunch break in anticipation of the drum session scheduled for the afternoon and left it open while I went to lunch.  During lunch break no one noticed any power fluctuations or cuts, although the Mac, monitor and MOTU interface are running on a UPS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I came back in after lunch, the first thing I noticed was all the meters on the MOTU were green along the bottom line... the project was still open on the Mac, but the computer didn't respond to any commands from the fingerboard and the mouse was inoperative.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I forced a shutdown by holding down the power button, and waited for about 5 minutes.  When I tried booting again, the power light would not stay on, and no chime,  although the fans came on and the hard drives also whirred and buzzed as usual.  On the mother board the red pilot light was on, and the 4 green lights on the edge of the motherboard were also lit.  No activity on the monitor whatsoever.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been very pleased with this set-up (although I am a recent Mac convert) and this is the first problem I've had since I set the studio up in February.  However I am in the middle of a project and facing a deadline.  Any suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am hoping to be able to take advantage of the cheap prices of this computer and make a complete redundant system for the studio for back up and emergencies.  Any comment?  I'm assuming I should be able to find power supplies, memory, etc. at least for the present.

Al,

	Your problem isn't a good thing I'm sorry to say. When the computer is first started up some hardware test are run. When you hear the Chime, thats the computers announcement that test have passed and the computer is going switch over to loading the software on the hard drives. Lacking the chime your computer has indicated there might well be some kind of hardware failure. Lets give this set of instructions a try first and see if it gets you somewhere quickly
