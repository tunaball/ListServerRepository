<PRE>Help!  I was working on a project on my G4 Digital Audio running Digital
Performer 3 on OS 9.2, through a MOTU 2408 Mk II.   I was working all
morning, and then I opened a new file before lunch break in anticipation of
the drum session scheduled for the afternoon and left it open while I went
to lunch.  During lunch break no one noticed any power fluctuations or
cuts, although the Mac, monitor and MOTU interface are running on a UPS.

When I came back in after lunch, the first thing I noticed was all the
meters on the MOTU were green along the bottom line... the project was
still open on the Mac, but the computer didn't respond to any commands from
the fingerboard and the mouse was inoperative.

I forced a shutdown by holding down the power button, and waited for about
5 minutes.  When I tried booting again, the power light would not stay on,
and no chime,  although the fans came on and the hard drives also whirred
and buzzed as usual.  On the mother board the red pilot light was on, and
the 4 green lights on the edge of the motherboard were also lit.  No
activity on the monitor whatsoever.

I have been very pleased with this set-up (although I am a recent Mac
convert) and this is the first problem I've had since I set the studio up
in February.  However I am in the middle of a project and facing a
deadline.  Any suggestions?

I am hoping to be able to take advantage of the cheap prices of this
computer and make a complete redundant system for the studio for back up
and emergencies.  Any comment?  I'm assuming I should be able to find power
supplies, memory, etc. at least for the present.

Thanks
