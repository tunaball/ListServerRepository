I'm looking for a new home for my venerable G4. &#160;It is the Digital
Audio model, upgraded with a dual 1.0 GHz processor from a
Quicksilver, the full complement of RAM, an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro video
card, a USB 2.0 card, a Samsung (I think) superdrive, and a
Thermaltake 430 watt power supply, along with the requisite adapter
(from www.atxg4.com, check out his site!) which works wonderfully.
Also included will be the original power supply, which worked fine, I
just was in need of a project and wanted to see how well the atxg4
adapter worked. &#160;Also also included will be a pair of Apple Pro
speakers, the ones with the long cable, which are very nice but quite
useless without a machine to plug them into. &#160;This is a nice little
machine, currently running Leopard 10.5.6 quite well, but I need to
make room for other stuff. &#160;The case is in OK shape, a couple of
scuffs in the usual places and sticker residue on the back panel from
a previous owner. &#160;It's been in nonsmoking environment as long as I've
had it (three years) and shows no evidence of ever having been
subjected to it. &#160;(Cigarette smoke, that is.) &#160;Also, as a bonus, the
ability to handle drives larger than 128 GB has been bestowed upon
this Mac, and it comes with two 250 GB drives on the native ATA bus.
All of this for $100 plus actual shipping, which would be by UPS and
would probably be around $50, maybe less, depending on where you are
and how fast you want it to get there, I imagine... &#160;um, what else...
no keyboard, no mouse, as I need them. &#160;I would vastly prefer to sell
the whole thing as a unit because I'm lazy and that would be easier so
I'll give preference to anyone who takes the whole thing over, say,
someone who wants a bit or a piece. &#160;Feel free to make offers...

Paypal preferred...
