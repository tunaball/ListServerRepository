You may want to take a look at Apple.com &gt; Support  &gt; Discussions .  
You can browse the categories and if you sign up or belong to .Mac  
(ughhh) that will allow you the privileges to post questions.  They  
have a vast list of areas that can be used to check just about  
anything  Apple.  including, but not limited too it&#8217;s OS releases.   
Now remember that mostly people with problems will be posting the  
questions, with the occasional &quot;well mine works fine&quot;  So do not be  
discouraged when all you see are problems, that is why the discussion  
list is  there. The key is, how many  questions are posted on your  
area of interest and how new ae they.

  When a new release comes out there is inevitably a rash of  
problems, some with the software,  some with the person who installs  
the OS.  What I look for,  is after a few weeks have the amount of  
messages gone down and only a relatively few keep coming in compared  
to opening day. Usually by 2 weeks  the major bugs have been dealt  
with and by a month it should be clear sailing. Remember it's Apples  
sand box so anything to nasty against the product may get you get  
kicked out. On the outside boards you just get your question flamed  
if it's too negative but the good answers come from those who post to  
you personally. It does not help if your stuck on a problem and  
someone says, mine works fine.  I like to get the latest the OS  
upgrades as Apple especially with OS X each one has been a huge leap  
in every respect. However there is no reason not to follow your  
strategy and save a few bucks and wait till the new price is half or  
33% of what I paid originally. The only concern for me is security  
and by staying current I am keeping the software as secure as  
possible..I hope.  I would say most of the people who have problems  
seem to be those who load up on a lot of 3rd party software and  
tinker with the OS and are not level 3 tinkers yet.. Now I use some  
of the best  3rd party software out there but I do not download  
anything and everything  just to have a look and this computer has  
run pain free for 9 months. Also Macfixit is a good source
