<PRE>I picked up a QuickSilver for parts off eBay.  The case says it's a 1GHz 
dual-processor, which would make it a QS2002, but the seller said it 
won't boot, and the processor is definitely only a single CPU, not a 
dual.  It arrived today, and while I only bought it for parts, it's 
still a little disappointing.  The case looks pretty good, but it's 
loaded with dust, and a lot of the screws were torqued down way too tight.

The hard drive was stripped (I expected that), as was the memory (that 
makes sense, but I was still hoping it had memory).  The CPU turns out 
to be a 933MHz single, not even a 1GHz single (though that's not a huge 
difference).  The video card is an nVidia GeForce2 MX, which was 
available in the QS, but not the QS2002.  So, the CPU and video card 
apparently came from an older computer.  The big question is whether the 
motherboard also came from an older QS or the newer QS2002.  The 
difference is that the QS2002 doesn't have the 120GB limit on hard drives.

The motherboard may not even work, but in case it does, how do I tell if 
it's a QS or a QS2002?

I hope the power supply works!

Thanks!

P.S. - It looks like one of the pins in the motherboards CPU socket is 
bent or broken.  I'll need to get a magnifying glass to tell if it's 
repairable.  I can't believe I don't already own a magnifying glass!
