<PRE>&lt;&lt; Hey, Steve...


When you use OS9 applications or files under your 10.3.9 OS, maybe your 

system opens Classic in order to do that?

That's what happens to me when I try to open an old file that was made 

and saved under OS9. Classic opens and then I can work with it just 

fine, but technically, I'm not working with OSX. I'm on the same machine 

as my OSX, but Classic is doing all the work.


I must say, tho', as I'm up to 10.4.8 now, I rarely go back to use any 

Classic files or applications anymore...


keith whaley &gt;&gt;

Keith,

It all depends. For example, if I open a ClarisWorks doc that I created in 
OS9, it will run classic and then open the OS9 version of ClarisWorks (because I 
have no OSX version of ClarisWorks), but if I create a pic in an OS9 version 
of GraphicConverter and try to open it in OSX, it boots the OSX version of 
GraphicConverter and then opens the pic. So, my conclusion is that it has to do 
with the app and its connection to it, and not a OS9/classic vs OSX 
relationship.

In fact, this was a recent problem for me as I went to open a Quicken file, 
expecting classic to open the OS9 version of Quicken and open the file, but 
instead it booted the OSX version of Quicken and immediately made the file 
inoperable in OS9. It took a while to rectify the situation, but I did it. I boot 
into classic every day, and until I can migrate some stuff I have without losing 
some of it, I will be using classic for a long time to come.

Now, maybe I misunderstood the original post (which I can't seem to find) but 
I thought he was saying he couldn't even use the OS9 files in OSX because he 
transferred them via a flash drive. Did I read it wrong.

STeve
