Tony,

	A bit of google searching provides some answers. I find that you might purchase OS X 10.4 on ebay anywhere from about $40 and up. Beware however that you must not purchase 2 disk sets or restore disk of any kind. You must purchase the Retail version or Family version (the same thing) which comes on a single DVD. Other forms of Tiger install disk are for specific hardware and will fail to work on yours.

Apple provides a Safari update for Tiger, version 4.1 at:

<A HREF="http://support.apple.com/downloads/Safari_4_0_5">http://support.apple.com/downloads/Safari_4_0_5</A>

	If you don't mind using a Mozilla browser instead of Safari, try looking at tenfourfox, or Camino web browsers today and see if they will work for you.You should also know if your websites are using flash, your going to have trouble no matter what. Adobe stopped supporting flash for PPC's some time ago (version 10.1 I think). So when you land on a website that demands flash, the site will complain that you need to upgrade your flash player. Which you can't do because there isn't one. When I run into these issues I complain to the website admin for using flash in the first place, or I look for a mobile version of their site, or I go elsewhere. An alternative which hasn't worked out very well under Linux OS's is to use Gnash instead of flash player. I haven't bothered to try it on OS X so I can't say how well it works.
