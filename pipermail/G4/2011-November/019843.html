For OS 9 the only real option is Classilla
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.classilla.org/releases/">http://www.classilla.org/releases/</A>&gt;

All versions of Safari are for OS 10.x.x

Firefox is pretty easy to use and, much as I agree that using Apple stuff on Apple machines makes sense . . . When the Apple stuff doesn't work try the open source offerings.

This comes from my OS 9.1 box which is an Apple 8500 with a Sonnet G3 upgrade. It's more of a workhorse than my G4.

Your banking issues just might be nothing more than the browser identifier line that is sent up with the first call to the bank.  It is possible to change that line but I donno how for Safari. Anyone know ??

Another option might be iCab which offers that change right up front.  iCab was my favorite until it moved to OS 10 and stopped supporting OS 9.  A lot of nice things got lost.

If you start with the Safari that came with OS 10.3 I'm pretty sure you can still upgrade to the most current version of that through the normal Apple channels.
