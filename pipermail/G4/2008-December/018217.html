<PRE>Back in the day, Partitioning was of value as most HD maintenance  
utilities had issues with large volumes and some computers did not  
handle Volumes larger than 128GB. In this day and age, most OS's have  
no problem with large Volumes, and most Maintenance apps are smart  
enough to deal with defragging or fixing large volumes. Also Once  
upon a Time, You could make the Computer Use more of the HD when you  
partitioned the HD into smaller blocks. Its Common knowledge that the  
HD Capacity of the HD is Not the Actual Size... 250GB is never gonna  
be 250GB no matter how you format it, its always gonna be around 211  
or 212GB. BEcause of the OS uses a top portion of the Drive for its  
own use.

Also, all the Drive manufacturers label their drives as Gigabit  
instead of the common Gigabyte. 250Gb is not 250GB but most people  
don't understand it. So your 750GB no matter how its formatted will  
never be a total of 750GB. But thats just how it is, and if you don't  
accept it then you will be always mad.

A few other schemes exist for partitioning large volumes such as  
having a Large volume be partitioned for use by multiple OS's for a  
Dual or even Triple Boot system. But the simple matter is pretty much  
all modern computers and their counterpart OS's have no problems with  
large volumes.

For example my wife has a 250GB HD in her Windows box. Its  
partitioned into 2 volumes 125GB each so she has Windows XP on one  
volume and Windows 98SE on the other volume, her's is a Dual boot  
system so she can use some older programs in the OS it prefers.

A client of mine has his Mac Pro's main HD a 500GB partitioned into 2  
drives, one for Mac OSX 10.5 and the other for Ubuntu Linux 8.10  
setup as a Dual Boot system so he can make the most of both worlds.

Other reasons could be maybe your new 750GB You'd like to have in  
different volumes for your Data, perhaps Three 250GB volumes for  
Music, Movies, and Photos.

And some people just leave their drives intact so they have One big  
Volume for Video Files etc.

Peace,
