I agree with this line of thought! When I 
switched from OS9 to OSX (spring 2002) I made 
lots of research about advantages and 
disadvantages about partitioning and about 
keeping OSes apart, and then I choose that road. 
I also read Missing Manual by David Pogue, and 
learned a lot from that, I highly recommend it.

Best thing for me in the beginning was the easy 
way to choose wich OS I would start up with (just 
hold down alt or option during startup, and then 
choose the right drive), but what I find pleasing 
now is that I dont have to guess which files on 
my drives belong to which OS. Things are kept 
apart and cant mistakenly be placed in wrong 
folders. Very easy to learn what is what. Also 
there is this fact that OSX makes many many 
invisible files, and if I start up with OS9 I 
don't have to bother with them because I don't 
open that folder.

There are of course disadvantages to partitioning 
(mostly that one day you want one partition to be 
larger, and that can't be done without wiping 
everything out before) but if you actually have 
two physically separate drives then that's not 
the same problem. (Yes, you want a bigger drive, 
but that can be solved without wiping everything 
out..:-)


The idea of backup (that was mentioned) is course 
a very important subject and having two 
physically separated drives (not partitions) is a 
very good method. But this is not my strongest 
field, I backup to CDs and DVDs, and not as 
regularly as I should... (bad Vicki, bad bad 
bad....).
