</I>&gt;<i> genius in my house full of PC users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	My step son has a band and just finished recording his third album.  
</I>&gt;<i> I ripped the master CD with iTunes in order to make copies for them to 
</I>&gt;<i> sell.  I have a smart playlist with all of their songs in it.  My wife 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted a CD with all three albums on it.  The only problem was that 
</I>&gt;<i> the total playing time of all three combined was about 86 minutes.  6 
</I>&gt;<i> minutes too long for a CD-R.  I noticed that the last track on their 
</I>&gt;<i> last album was about 15 minutes long.  It turns out that it was a 
</I>&gt;<i> three minute song with about a 9 minute pause and a three minute 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;hidden track&quot;.  So, the challenge was to figure out a way to split 
</I>&gt;<i> the one track into the two songs and get rid of the dead air.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	The first thing I did was make a copy of the song in case I messed 
</I>&gt;<i> up.  After that, I opened iMovie and clicked on the audio tab.  That 
</I>&gt;<i> brought up a list of my iTunes library.  I located the track and 
</I>&gt;<i> dragged it to the clip section.  I found a view option that showed the 
</I>&gt;<i> sound waves from the song.  That allowed me to &quot;see&quot; the first song, 
</I>&gt;<i> the dead air, and the second song.  I clipped and highlighted from 
</I>&gt;<i> right after the first song all the way to the end of the track and cut 
</I>&gt;<i> that section out.  I saved the file as a .mov file to my desktop.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't see any other save options in iMovie to choose from.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> repeated the process but eliminated the first song and the dead air 
</I>&gt;<i> leaving just the second song.  I saved that file to my desktop as 
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	After managing to separate the 2 songs, I opened Toast and selected 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Music&quot; CD.  I dragged the 2 files in to Toast which converted them to 
</I>&gt;<i> music files.  I then burned the 2 songs to a CD.  Finally, I imported 
</I>&gt;<i> the 2 songs from the CD into my iTunes folder.  Now I have all three 
</I>&gt;<i> albums ready to burn to CD.  I'm sure this all old hat to most of you, 
</I>&gt;<i> but it was pretty cool for me to strut around the house for a day 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;King of the Digital World&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	I just wanted to share the experience with ya'll.  Thanks for reading 
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks--
