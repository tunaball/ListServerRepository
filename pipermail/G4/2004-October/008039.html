I have the same problem with a G4 867 MHz.  I installed a FW/USB combo 
card and sleep actually worked better for a while because I plugged my 
keyboard and mouse into the new ports and my computer wouldn't wake up 
every few minutes like it was.

Everything worked fine until one day when I installed a few Norton 
products.  Immediately afterward, I had the sleep problem where the 
monitor goes off and hard drives spin down but the fan keeps going and 
I can't wake up the computer.  I uninstalled the Norton products but it 
didn't help.  I don't know if it triggered the problem but it was 
minutes after that the problem started.

Anyway, I was just going to try to take out that card and see if it 
helped kick the sleep back to working and reinstall it.  I know it 
worked at one time.
