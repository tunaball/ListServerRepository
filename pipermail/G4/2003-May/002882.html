Maybe you have an early one. I'm still trying to figure out which PSU 
goes with which board, without a single actual unit in front of me. 
AFAIK, the 20-pin PSU is a very easy PSU to replace, as it's the one 
that came with the Graphite G4 (Yikes board) and is the same as the 
G3 B&amp;W PSU. I've seen a fair few of them on eBay for cheap.

Go on, there must be a million people reading this list, contradict 
me if one of you knows better. I desire knowledge. Shits me to tears, 
frankly, the apathy on  Mac lists. I answer questions as best I can 
and nobody ever makes an attempt to answer mine. I'm not that bloody 
smart. My questions can't be so obscure that NOBODY knows.

&gt;<i>	I can't help you with the pin outs, sorry. The pin outs for my PS
</I>&gt;<i>were shown in an article in the Apple Knowledge base which discussed
</I>&gt;<i>diagnosing and replacing the power supply in G4's that showed no symptoms
</I>&gt;<i>of life.
</I>
Thanks. I'll look for it.

&gt;<i>	You mention that Apple sells/refurbishes power supplies..... but
</I>&gt;<i>for a high price. I haven't been able to find anything about that on the
</I>&gt;<i>Apple site.  The only place I've found ANY power supplies is at
</I>&gt;<i>hardcoreMac, and they didn't have much available.
</I>
Basically every time I have contacted an Apple reseller (or Apple 
themselves) about getting a power supply for a G4, they have told me 
that I need to have a broken one to give them or they will simply 
never sell me a thing. Secondly, I have to be prepared to pay $AU300+ 
for the replacement unit, and they must have the original case to 
install it in. No I'm not allowed to install it myself, no matter 
that I've worked as a Mac technician and Digital Imaging lecturer in 
two of the best art schools in the country.

hardcoreMac are bloody expensive. They charge $US249 for a Gigabit 
Ethernet board, and I see those go every day on eBay for $US149 or 
less. I have never seen them offer any power supply at all, but if 
they ever did I bet they would charge far too much for it.

&gt;<i>	Your speculations as to why they're hard to find are interesting...
</I>&gt;<i>but repairing one can't be all that difficult and it seems that some
</I>&gt;<i>entrepreneur somewhere MUST HAVE started up a little part-time business
</I>&gt;<i>repairing them for a reasonable cost.
</I>
Mate, I've been looking for seven months. If you can find one please 
let me know. I'm trying to help. I'm offering you my limited 
knowledge. I'm no expert, just a guy like you. Sure, I'm willing to 
accept your conjecture that someone somewhere must be addressing this 
market niche, but mate, it's guesswork just like mine. Find something 
and I'll be interested. If I find anything, I'll post it here.

&gt;<i>   But it'd still be nice if someone
</I>&gt;<i>could give me a steer to a reliable source for these things.
</I>
If you can get onto the xlr8yourmac.com forums by hook or by crook, 
Tycho might know. So far I've been unable to get in contact with him.

Kay Gabriel Orchison, at your service sir.
