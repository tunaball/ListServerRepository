<PRE>My ex girlfriend uses Hotmail (as well as Yahoo mail) and at first it 
was problematic, then after some fiddling with the cookies and 
different 'entry points' (such as going in through hotmail.com rather 
than a bookmarked link to the login page or vice versa) we were able to 
get it working. Then, about two months ago, she started having the 
problem you describe. I'm still not sure how she solved it, but she 
did. She claims it affected Yahoo as well (the inability of a form 
submit button to respond to a click) but I'm skeptical of that one. 
Regardless, she was able to fiddle with it until it worked.
