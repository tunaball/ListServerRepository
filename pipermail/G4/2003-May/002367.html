I faced the same challenge ( Scanmaker E3) when I upgraded from my 
trusty and much loved Sonnet-powered 6400 to a Sawtooth. The SCSI 
card equiped G4 didn't recognize the E3. So what to do? The choice 
seemed pretty straightforward . . . . I could buy many a USB scanner 
for well under a hundred bucks or I could add VueScan software at 
fifty.

My E3 was working fine and I was satisfied with its output. I also 
tried a low-priced scanner for a weekend. It worked but compared with 
the tank-sized stature of the old E3 it seemed so flimsy. Others 
obviously are better. In the end I decided to go the VueScan route . 
. . . I have been more than happy with that decision. Of course if 
your E3 isn't meeting your needs then why spend a nickle to drive it? 
That must be the deciding factor.
Good luck,
Michael
