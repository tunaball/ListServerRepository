<PRE>Looks like I'm gonna need another power supply.  A year ago it was an
intense thunderstorm that did it... but this year  I dunno what .... It
just died on me.   Clearly, the 5V trickle voltage needed for start-ups is
not there so I'm presuming that a replacement is needed.

	But which one? It's either the 208 watt supply or the 237 watt
supply.  But in my researches I'm finding conflicting info.

Maybe that's the wrong question... does it make a difference technically?
If the pinout voltages the same on both units they ought to be
interchangeable. But I don't have any manuals to refer to for the two
supplies and the Apple site isn't much help. )

	Early AGP's were powered with a 208 watt supply and later ones with
a 237 watt.  I found a reference at HardcoreMac that suggested that the
237W supply is used with Rev 2 motherboard and beyond. I inferred from this
reference that it is important not to get the wrong power supply (for what
reason?).   However, I seem to have a 237W supply and my motherboard is a
Revision 1 (I think).. I'm wondering whether this contributed to the early
death of my machine.

	Does anybody know of an authoritative source for figuring which one
I should be using? Or if it matters.

	I'm also having trouble locating a source for the power supply.
Suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,

John
