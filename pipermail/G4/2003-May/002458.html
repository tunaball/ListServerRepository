<PRE>Hi, all. I got a 1.25 dualie G4 to replace my 1 ghz dual G4 from two 
generations ago. I am happy with the machine overall, but recently 
it's been seeming very slow to me. Color wheels, slowness when 
swapping between apps, that kind of thing. Eudora seems downright 
slow, something that shouldn't be. All in all it seems like it's 
slower than my old dual 1 ghz, which is really a bummer.

I've got everything updated and normal, and I don't believe there's a 
software reason why it should be slower. All Apple software is 
updated. I do have only EIDE hard drives in this machine, vs. an EIDE 
RAID card joining two drives on my 1 ghz, but it shouldn't make that 
much of a difference in speed perception to my mind.

I have 1.25 gigs of memory -- could that not be enough? I do a lot of 
apps at once, Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, GoLive. Is there a 
way to see graphically if the machine is swapping memory?
