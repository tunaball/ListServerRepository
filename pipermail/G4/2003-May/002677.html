<PRE>Would this work for operas, too?  I had ripped Turandot a few weeks 
ago, and last night I finally listened to it via iTrip on my stereo 
system.  iTunes ripped each passage as a different selection, and 
that is great for finding particular passages from the opera, but it 
makes the listening experience very disjointed.  And, it also seems 
to cut off a few seconds from the end of the passages.  Also, for 
some strange reason, it plays the introduction to Act 2 at the very 
end of the opera!

BTW, iTrip ( US$35 at 
<A HREF="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/itrip/">http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/itrip/</A>) seems to work 
superbly.  It's just begun to ship.  I received mine by UPS 2nd day 
air at about 6PM last night, and I have tried it on stereo sets 
inside the house, but not yet in my car.  Aesthetically, it is a 
BEAUTY!  Especially that bright blue LED against the snow-white 
tubular body.  You can shut off the LED, but I just love being able 
to see its beauty.  As for range, it is a pretty up-close 
proposition, maybe a bit analogous to Blue Tooth.  When I placed it 
atop my stereo receiver, the reception was nearly perfect.  I was 
able to get half-decent reception when I took it into the bathroom, 
about 20 feet from the receiver, but the reception was only 
acceptable when I actually held the iPod in my hand (I guess that my 
body became a radiating antenna, too).  FYI, Griffin folk are still 
working on an iTrip model to fit the new iPods.

Thanks for any additional enlightenment,

Steve

(BTW, I took the liberty of cc:-ing the general G4 list, as this is 
likely to be of interest to a wider group of Mac folk.  Please excuse 
me if I have breached list etiquette.)
