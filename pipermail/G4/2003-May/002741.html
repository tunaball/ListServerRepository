<PRE>Thanks Jim.  I did not read the article.  Bunch of loonies wackos. Ignore
them. 

Now for a G4 question:  Any one knows how to run ITunes visual effects on
two monitors? Mine only runs on one. Thanks

Here is the really good part: snipped from the website in question.

Apple Macintosh:


Hypnotically encased iMacs trick unsuspecting computer users into 
accepting Darwinism

However, these propagandists aren't just targeting the young. Take for 
example Apple Computers, makers of the popular Macintosh line of 
computers. The real operating system hiding under the newest version of 
the Macintosh operating system (MacOS X) is called... Darwin! That's 
right, new Macs are based on Darwinism! While they currently don't 
advertise this fact to consumers, it is well known among the computer 
elite, who are mostly Atheists and Pagans. Furthermore, the Darwin OS is 
released under an &quot;Open Source&quot; license, which is just another name for 
Communism. They try to hide all of this under a facade of shiny, 
&quot;lickable&quot; buttons, but the truth has finally come out: Apple Computers 
promote Godless Darwinism and Communism.

But is this really such a shock? Lets look for a moment at Apple 
Computers. Founded by long haired hippies, this company has consistently 
supported 60's counter-cultural &quot;values&quot;2. But there are even darker 
undertones to this company than most are aware of. Consider the name of 
the company and its logo: an apple with a bite taken out of it. This is 
clearly a reference to the Fall, when Adam and Eve were tempted with an 
apple3 by the serpent. It is now Apple Computers offering us temptation, 
thereby aligning themselves with the forces of darkness4.

This company is well known for its cult-like following. It isn't much of 
a stretch to say that it is a cult. Consider co-founder and leader Steve 
Jobs' constant exhortation through advertising (i.e. mind control) that 
its followers should &quot;think different&quot;. We have to ask ourselves: &quot;think 
different than whom or what?&quot; The disturbing answer is that they want us 
to think different than our Christian upbringing, to reject all the 
values that we have been taught and to heed not the message of the Lord 
Jesus Christ!

Given the now obvious anti-Christian and cultish nature of Apple 
Computers, is it any wonder that they have decided to base their newest 
operating system on Darwinism? This just reaffirms the position that 
Darwinism is an inherently anti-Christian philosophy spread through 
propaganda and subliminal trickery, not a science as its brainwashed 
followers would have us believe.
