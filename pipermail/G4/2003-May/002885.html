Tycho has a new site he and Elroy created not so long ago. He also has a
&quot;Ask Tycho&quot; section in the forums =)

&gt;<i>From his postings and help thru the year/s, he is one of the main reasons my
</I>Mac's run =)

Though with my every day kinda knowledge there isnt much of a way I can
repay for all his/their help, so like a lot of people we are crunching
RC5-72 for the XLR8yourmac team to give something back to the cause. ( and
beat out the PC's that we can )

There are links to the RC5 stuff as well on his site as well as all kinds of
little Mac goodies...

Btw:  Elroy also lives down under and Im sure he would be quite happy to
help out a Mac mate in distress.
