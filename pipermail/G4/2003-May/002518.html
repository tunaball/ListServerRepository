&lt;&lt; Here's more:
I cannot run my Photopage program.  It crashes before it launches.

I put a CD with pictures in the CD drive and it is not recognized.  
Does not appear on the desktop at all.  I now hit the CD eject button 
and nothing happens.  I now have a CD in there and cannot get it out.

The list continues to build....

OS 10.2.5 sucks for me! &gt;&gt;

It appears to me that the problem here is not the OS version. You are having 
too many problems for it to be that simple. I suspect a complete 
reinstallation will be necessary, but let's address other issues for a moment.

With your CD stuck in the drive, I suggest doing a hard shut-down. Just pull 
the power plug and turn off your computer.

Now, put the plug back in and power-up. Hold down the mouse button during the 
boot. This should make your computer spit out the CD since the CD does not 
have an active system on it. If that doesn't work, look for the emergency 
eject hole on the front of the CD reader and insert a straightened paper clip 
to force eject the CD.

With that issue out of the way:

ClarisWorks is something that you will HAVE TO REPLACE as quickly as 
possible. It is too old to run correctly with the newer OS-X versions. It 
will continue to cause problems as you upgrade your OS installation. Bite the 
bullet on this one. In my experience, there is no choice to this issue.

As to the problem with the OS,

Return to the earlier version that you said was working for you. Use the OS-X 
installation CD that you have to perform a new installation of the OS by 
selecting &quot;Archive and save&quot; during the install procedure. When you archive 
and save, you have a chance to keep your third party program files and can 
review your configurations while doing a re-install of the third party 
programs.

I know this sounds like a tremendous amount of work, but what is the 
alternative for you? 

You do not have the lastest OS installation CD to work with, so you have to 
do the work one step at a time while trying to save as much data as you can. 
I suggest that you call 1-800-MY-APPLE and purchase the upgrade CD so you 
will have a hard copy of the latest OS on hand all the time.

Sorry for sounding so brutal, but s&amp;*) happens sometimes.
