Sorry for the long delay in thanking everyone for sending answers to my 
problem.  I have been ill with the Flu.

I took the computer into the Apple Store on Fri. the 16th.  Needless to 
say after up and running for about an hour the computer made not a sound 
other than the fan noise.  The tech.  suggested I purchase Apple Care.  I 
stopped at Fry's Electronics and purchased a WD FireWire External Hard 
Drive.  By the time I got home I was very ill.  The computer and WD Hard 
Drive have sat for over a week.

The computer is not longer making *the* clicking noises.  I was using a 
USB Hub, but when I set the computer backup, I did not use the Hub.  
Reason for clicking noises????

Now I cannot get the WD Hard Drive set up.  You have to restart in OS 9.  
Run the Software Installer for the WD CD.  Then launch the WD FireWire 
Disk Utility program.  When I do that, I get an error message: 'No 
Supported Device Found! Put the WD FireWire Support Driver into your 
Extensions Folder and Restart.'
Per WD troubleshooting site this is caused by corrupted extensions.  I 
have installed the extensions 4 times.   Needless to say WD is closed 
until Tues.

If my hard drive is going to die, I hope it will wait until at least Wed.

again thanks for all the help,

Sherry
