<PRE>Jim, I had a similar problem with a 120 Gig Western Digital HD in an 
ADS Firewire/USB2 enclosure. Messing around in OS 10.2.6 trying to 
partition the drive, I managed to &quot;lose&quot; all but 32 Gigs of disk 
space. I went through all the shenanigans below, but finally pulled 
the drive out of the enclosure and connected it up inside my G4 
Sawtooth as a slave drive and reformatted it with Hard Disk Tool Kit 
3.5 in OS 9.2.1. Magically the drive popped back up to the 117 odd 
Gigs that it originally had. I then put everything back the way it 
was and backed up all my drives (two SCSI partitions and one IDE) to 
the Firewire external using Retrospect Express 5.
Can you boot your G4 933 in OS 9. If so, the above route is the way to go.

Mike

</I>&gt;<i>Brian,
</I>&gt;<i>    Thanks for the reply.
</I>&gt;<i>    While I do get the drive to show up on Apple Profiler, it does 
</I>&gt;<i>not show up on Disk Utility, greyed out or otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Well, I just tried again to no avail so I unplugged and 
</I>&gt;<i>replugged. Two of my three partitions mounted. The third was 
</I>&gt;<i>described as &quot;unknown&quot; and a message said it would not mount. This 
</I>&gt;<i>is the one I had my main drive backed up on using CCC. Then I 
</I>&gt;<i>rechecked Disk Utility and now all three are there with &quot;Backup&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>(unknown) greyed out. So I used DiskFirst Aid to repair the drive 
</I>&gt;<i>(partition).  The phrase &quot;Keys out of order&quot; is the first sign of 
</I>&gt;<i>problem, followed by &quot;Rebuilding Catalog B-tree&quot;. It's been going 
</I>&gt;<i>for 5 minutes with no sign of progress so we'll see.
</I>&gt;<i>    After 40 min. I stopped it.......Well, after some screwing around 
</I>&gt;<i>I  verified and repaired the partition.  It still wouldn't mount so 
</I>&gt;<i>I went to disc utility to follow your advice; highlight and mount 
</I>&gt;<i>from options.The color wheel came up when I clicked on the 
</I>&gt;<i>partition. It's still spinning. I can't even force quit.
</I>&gt;<i>    So whenever I try to work on the drive using Disk Utility the 
</I>&gt;<i>program locks up. I can still use the computer for certain jobs but 
</I>&gt;<i>the drive and Disk Utility is locked up.
</I>&gt;<i>    So even if I do get the drive to show up on Disk Utility, I still 
</I>&gt;<i>can't use it.
</I>&gt;<i>    Any more thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>    Jim
