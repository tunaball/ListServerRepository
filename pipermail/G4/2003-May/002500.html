<PRE>I have tried everything and everyone else, so I thought I'd bring the
problem to you all and see if any one has any suggestions. This is a
question for Network Experts.  Here goes:

I have a home DSL network set up with three Mac's (G4 with 10.2.6, two G3's
with 9.2.2), an IBM Think Pad PC (Win 2000 NT server edition), and a Brother
MFC 3100 usb printer with printer sharing for the Mac's. The PC is a work
issued laptop, and our work network is a very secure VPC. I had the entire
network and printer running on a D-Link router with a print server set up in
the D-Link router. In order to use the DSL for the IBM, we were issued a
Zyxel 300 series router. This is the only way we can access the VPC through
the DSL. The DSL access for all computers is still functional

I have lost the entire print network because the Zyxel router is ROM locked.
If I &quot;crack&quot; it, I will be fired. Only a printer hooked directly to each
machine will work. The Zyxel router allows no pass through due to security
issues with our VPC. The support staff from the outside provider
(Accellerant) WILL not allow access to this router. Their exact words were &quot;
Is the network access working for the IBM&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot; We don't support any
other hardware or installation&quot; .  I have tried all methods of using two
routers, static IP's, crossover cables vs. patch, splitting the line for a
separate DSL hookup, etc. Nothing works. I have two teenage daughters and am
getting tired of printing their homework each day. All I want is shared
printing access. Any Ideas??
