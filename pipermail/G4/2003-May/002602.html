Subject: Re: [G4] WD HD

Brian,
    Thanks for the reply.
    While I do get the drive to show up on Apple Profiler, it does not 
show up on Disk Utility, greyed out or otherwise.

    Well, I just tried again to no avail so I unplugged and replugged. 
Two of my three partitions mounted. The third was described as 
&quot;unknown&quot; and a message said it would not mount. This is the one I had 
my main drive backed up on using CCC. Then I rechecked Disk Utility and 
now all three are there with &quot;Backup&quot; (unknown) greyed out. So I used 
DiskFirst Aid to repair the drive (partition).  The phrase &quot;Keys out of 
order&quot; is the first sign of problem, followed by &quot;Rebuilding Catalog 
B-tree&quot;. It's been going for 5 minutes with no sign of progress so 
we'll see.
    After 40 min. I stopped it.......Well, after some screwing around I  
verified and repaired the partition.  It still wouldn't mount so I went 
to disc utility to follow your advice; highlight and mount from 
options.The color wheel came up when I clicked on the partition. It's 
still spinning. I can't even force quit.
    So whenever I try to work on the drive using Disk Utility the 
program locks up. I can still use the computer for certain jobs but the 
drive and Disk Utility is locked up.
    So even if I do get the drive to show up on Disk Utility, I still 
can't use it.
    Any more thoughts?

Thanks,
    Jim
