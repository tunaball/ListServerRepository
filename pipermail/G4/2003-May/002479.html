<PRE>Ernie-
The original request was for help with Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) to copy the OS X startup disk to a new, larger disk.  
I have X.2.5 and 9.2.2 running on it now (and quite well, I might add!) and am also running an ATI 7000 video board in it as well.  The CPU is a 500 MHz G4 ZIFand the jumpers were set to allow it to run at that speed, and the cache is enabled.  Instead of having two separate versions of 9.2.2, I have 9.2.2 only on a slave drive that I can set as the boot drive as well;  saves wasting disk space.  The drive containing 9.2.2 is presently not installed, so I can try to clone the startup drive to the new one.  There are 2 partitions on the new drive - the first is about 8GB, and the second a little over 11 GB.  As I stated previously, I'd like to clone the 4 GB startup to the 8 GB partition...
I still await any input from those experienced with CCC on a Beige G3/G4.
once again, tia.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;All-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;	I've upgraded a beige G3 to a 500 MHz G4, 768 MB RAM, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;OrangeMicro USB/Firewire card.  I had put OS X on the original 4 GB 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;HD that came with it, and had an additional 20 GB internal hooked 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;up on the same bus.  It is now time to finish the upgrade process, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;and I'd like to replace that original 4 GB HD with another 20 GB. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I've tried CCC but had no success whatsoever in getting a drive 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;that I can boot from.  The psync does not work, the blessing of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;drive does not work, and in general, I'm very frustrated in so much 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;that I've tried about a dozen times to perform this to no avail. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I've looked on Bombich's website, and it is little help.  I haven't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;found anything in the help that explicitly details the differences 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;for beiges...save for the blessing of the drive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;	Has anyone managed to do this successfully?  If so, how did 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;you do it?  Please describe in detail, or point me someplace to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;read how?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have earlier mentioned G4 Quicksilver OS X 2.4 installation. Have 
</I>&gt;<i> been successful too installing OS X 2.5 and OS 9.2 in beige G3 266 
</I>&gt;<i> mhz upgraded to Apple G4 400mhz ZIP, with ATI rage 128, usb, and 
</I>&gt;<i> Adaptec firewire card. RAM is 256 and HD is 60 gig IBM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The original G3 HD has been replaced with 60 gig HD and re-formatted 
</I>&gt;<i> and partitioned using Apple Disk Utilities, 7.94 and 52 gig. I 
</I>&gt;<i> installed OS 9.2 in 52 gig partition and made that my start-up disk. 
</I>&gt;<i> Clean installed OS X 2.4 in 7.94 gig HD and upon installation with 
</I>&gt;<i> Internet connection on, OS X automatically upgraded itself from Apple 
</I>&gt;<i> website to OS X 2.5. I have two OS 9.2, one is classic in 7.94 HD and 
</I>&gt;<i> another OS 9.2 in partition 52 gig HD. I can boot on any OS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing to consider in your case is the upgrade from beige G3 
</I>&gt;<i> to G4 500 since G3 has different revisions. Is your upgrade an Apple 
</I>&gt;<i> ZIP processor or a third party card? To upgrade to Apple ZIP G4 in 
</I>&gt;<i> some G3 revision needs a jumper. Consider also the video card in G3 
</I>&gt;<i> with OS X 2.5 installed, most effective is ATI rage 128.
