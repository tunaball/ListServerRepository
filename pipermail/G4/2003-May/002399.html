I did and have no regrets. ;-)

That's about the size of my biggest folder as well.  I've had no 
problems so far on both a G4 Cube (450MHz) and a new G4 MDD (dual 
1.42GHz).  Mail's a bit snappier on the new MMD, but it wasn't at all 
painful on the Cube.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is is possible to pickup email from different email accounts (from the
</I>&gt;<i> same ISP) without quitting and restarting Mail for each one? I have to
</I>&gt;<i> do this with Netscape Communicator.
</I>
I created multiple accounts in the Prefs pane. (for different ISPs, 
though) One feature that isn't well documented is the ability to add 
multiple email addresses in the &quot;Email Address:&quot; field in each account. 
  This gives the ability to choose which email address any given new 
message will use - and, I believe, which account the new message will 
use.  (There's an &quot;Account&quot; pull-down that will appear on the Compose 
window that will let you choose)  This is very handy for me as I have 
five different email addresses that I use for different purposes.  I'm 
not sure about outgoing mail, though.  I'm guessing that it's smart 
enough to choose which outgoing SMTP path to choose based on which 
address you pick in the pull-down.  I use one outgoing server for all 
my mail, so I'm not totally sure.
