<PRE>hello!

thanks for all the answers and yes of course it&#180;s a Power Pc 
Quicksilver 800mhz ( letter  c  fell off sorry..).

Looks I&#180;ve started something here..thoughtful comments..and this is a 
good one:
I'm waiting for GE to insist on changing the gauge of US railroads. 
Four feet seven and three quarters inches was pretty silly and it's too 
small. Make it two meters and change all of the rails.  Think how much 
GE could earn making replacement engines for its P6es that now 
dominate.

Describes very well what actually happens from time to time.

I will probably be back on more specific questions ..

/stefan

</I>&gt;<i> Yes to Ubuntu. To me its a pleasant return to the 70's when the ASR33

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And yes. I regularly come downstairs in the morning to find my G4
