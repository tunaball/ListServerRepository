1.) Too small for WHAT?

2.) Since when has rail gauge made any sense at all? In the U.S. it has 
apparently measured between 3 feet and 6 feet, depending...

&gt;<i> Make it two meters and change all of the rails.  
</I>
Whatever is finally agreed upon for what a 'standard gauge' really IS 
today, you can probably blame a lot of it on Englishman George 
Stephenson (1781-1848).

In the U.S. it's currently 4 foot, 8 1/2&quot;, by congressional decree, so 
Google says.

In any case, to make it 2 meters is not only arbitrary and without any 
drivers, but retrofitting the U.S. rail system would be night unto 
impossible.

Who owns a G4 AND an iMac, just to keep this pertinent, if not exactly 
'on track'... :-D


Think how
&gt;&gt;<i> much GE could earn making replacement engines for its P6es that now 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dominate.
