<PRE>well, heres what a do with mine
i kept os9.1 one not two, one is more useful, and then
install 10 , best to leave out the classic 9 since its
just an emulator and wont run many 9 apps.-so that its
a dual boot, you just go to the pefrence panel in
either system and tell it to restart from the other
system. the machine will run faster in 9,1 than in 10.

things that i do in 9.1: the main thing that i do is
edit video, i use cinestream which is a very good
system that got bought by autodesk and is used for
feature movies. its much easier to learn than anything
else and renders 4 times faster than fcp and twice as
fast as premiere. you can also run older editions of
premiere. you can buy these on ebay for nothing. i
have a new version of fcp on a new machine but i edit
90% of my video on my g4 400 and use fcp only when i
need a tool. and tools for video are now becoming
stand-alone so increasingly i just restart my g4 into
10 and use the newer tools without going to my fcp
machine.
i also have some 9apps that i stilll use, i'm
travelling now so they are not on this machine and
cant think of their names, but one is a photo video,
image cataloger that will find everything visual on
the drives and  make a thumbnail of it  so you where
it is. it will play the video clips too.
i use destiny media player which will do the same
thing with all sounds on your disks and is an easier
way to manage radio stations than itunes.
i also just spend less time waiting for my g4 w/9.1 to
do things, i have 3 machines that run on 10 and i'm
reminded every day that os 9.1 is faster and more
stable

&gt;<i> Hi all! My mom was cleaning out the basement and let

</I>&gt;<i> pretty-close-to-stock G4/500 (it has a stick of 64
</I>&gt;<i> megs of RAM in it in
</I>&gt;<i> addition to the stock 256, but that's all the
</I>&gt;<i> changes that I can see.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know this is far from the latest and greatest (I
</I>&gt;<i> have a Macbook Core 2 Duo
</I>&gt;<i> now) but I think the upgradeability of it is pretty
</I>&gt;<i> cool. I just want to
</I>&gt;<i> play around with it, recognizing that it can't do
</I>&gt;<i> everything newer machines
</I>&gt;<i> can do, and it's not as fast. So I don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> spend a Mac Mini-sized
</I>&gt;<i> amount of money on it. I'd be using it for iTunes,
</I>&gt;<i> NeoOffice,
</I>&gt;<i> surfing...light stuff. Not iMovie or
</I>&gt;<i> processor-intensive design work; I
</I>&gt;<i> assume it's not well suited for that in its stock
</I>&gt;<i> configuration.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So my thoughts are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. See if it still works (it turns on, I hear the
</I>&gt;<i> disk spinning, but I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't hear the Mac &quot;bong&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Get a monitor (this was already in my plans,
</I>&gt;<i> because I wanted one for
</I>&gt;<i> when I need to work for a long time on my Macbook.
</I>&gt;<i> Can the video card in
</I>&gt;<i> this computer work with today's monitors?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Get more RAM
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Install Tiger
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Hard drive? Superdrive? Processor upgrade? I've
</I>&gt;<i> read that a processor
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade is not a good investment because these
</I>&gt;<i> machines are still so behind
</I>&gt;<i> the Intel Macs. A super drive is not that expensive,
</I>&gt;<i> so, maybe? I already
</I>&gt;<i> have an external firewire drive that I use for Time
</I>&gt;<i> Machine backups, so I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know about getting a hard drive. But I know
</I>&gt;<i> they're also pretty cheap,
</I>&gt;<i> so, maybe?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't need wireless because I have an Airport
</I>&gt;<i> Extreme Base Station and
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm assuming) I can just connect it by Ethernet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there anything I'm not thinking of? Any other
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions you experts
</I>&gt;<i> might have? Thanks very much in advance for any
</I>&gt;<i> advice you may be able to
</I>&gt;<i> lend!
