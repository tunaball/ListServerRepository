</I>
Alas, much of my writing experience has been at the direction and  
oversight of departmental heads. For that, I can write a dry,  
factual, and concise record of events within my sight and hearing.

It is when I experience the writings of others who have not made  
basic definitions readily available to the reader that I sometimes  
have to interpret their statements with the knowledge of my  
experiences. Working for the State of California does not always give  
a person the proper tools to understand clearly terms that have not  
included their own individual explanation.

Thus, when Apple makes a certain statement, I have to interpret it  
within my knowledge/experience database and try to research some of  
the terms by consulting with peers or advisors who are willing to  
share their knowledge. I do not always get pertinent and factual  
definitions from others and do depend on the added education provided  
by this bulletin board and others that I follow.

When I am in the position of instructing a Macintosh novice, I always  
ask whether or not he/she has clearly understood the lesson and ask  
him/her to give me their own explanation of what has been learned so  
far. I found that this sort of dialogue helps them as much as me to  
be sure that they understand the procedures and mechanisms being  
taught. If all sounds good, then I proceed to the next phase of  
instruction.

Courtesy costs nothing and reaps many benefits.
