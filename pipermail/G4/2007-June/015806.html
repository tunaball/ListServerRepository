Amen!  (As I used to say before I was saved.)

Just by coincidence, the message following your message began (in  
response to a question about the new Safari browser):

    its a *beta* wait until the next rev. dont lose sleep.
    mine crashed constantly.  i just axed it. why worry?

How many violations would one ticket here?

I worked for some years in Asia -- Tokyo and Seoul.  During those  
years, I was the only native English speaker in the office.  I spent  
so much time translating bad English into good English that I came to  
look upon bad English as a language of its own.  I would tell our  
Japanese staff to translate documents into bad English -- don't worry  
about commas, etc. -- just get the meaning right. Then I would  
translate their bad English into good English.

An engineering professor friend in Finland once told me that the  
universal technical language was 'Bad English' -- everyone speaks it  
-- especially Americans!

Cheers,

earle

PS:  Do you ever read the NewsGroup alt.usage.english?  Some good
