<PRE>Wow, some people do get upset about things. It would certainly be  
unfair to remove someone permanently without warning. Thus far, I see  
some people expressing a lot of dissatisfaction with the off-topic  
material, and that's enough for me to drop it. In fact, I considered  
the subject finished, anyway. Now, in the mean time, any one on this  
list could very easily have brought some G4-related discussion to the  
list. The language-related messages were not blocking any body from  
doing that. Instead of boo-hooing about what others are doing, send  
your complaint if you have one and move along.

I don't think it's any more relevant to start posting your own &quot;me  
too&quot; messages that express your opinions of the character of those  
who were discussing English (i.e. they just want to show off).

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I don't understand is why the listmom hasn't removed the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individuals from the list that insist on continuing this dialog.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it says &quot;once removed&quot; your gone. The posters that insist on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continuing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this post also need to read the netiquette guidelines.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6.	Please keep &quot;me too&quot; messages off the list; these are best sent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> privately, if at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All most all of the posting under the Subject [G4] English? fall into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the &quot;me too,&quot; I want to brag about myself and see if you can top  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No one has &quot;insisted&quot; on continuing an off-topic discussion. There  
has been no request that people stop and a negative reply. For the  
record, the entire world doesn't have to obey rules absolutely  
strictly. People can govern themselves well enough to use an email  
list fairly freely - it helps them get to know one another, after all.

Did you want to discuss G4s? Lead the way!

Eric
</PRE>
