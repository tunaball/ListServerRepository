  Something is not being done properly because the &quot;Clean Install&quot;  
option is supposed to make it possible to install a brand new version  
of the operating system without deleting the older or original  
installation and its contents (extensions, drivers, etc) . This was  
supposed to be to allow you to install a &quot;non-corrupted&quot; version of  
the operating system and then use it to determine what was causing  
the problems with the old system. You could then bring in &quot;extra  
programs from third party developers&quot; one at a time and test for the  
problem being resolved.

A thought occurred to me that you might be able to make a copy of an  
OS-9 installation onto a USB drive and then &quot;sneakernet&quot; it to the  
machine you need it on. From there, it is just a simple drag and drop  
copy onto the hard drive and then select that system folder as your  
Classic environment in System Preferences.

As an experiment, I just did that exact procedure with an iBook that  
would not recognize my OS-9.2.1 CD to install from. I made a copy of  
OS-9.2.2 from my personal G5 tower onto my flash drive, carried it to  
the iBook, drag and dropped the folder to the hard drive, and checked  
System Preferences/Startup Disk to see whether the OS-9 folder would  
be recognized. It was recognized, so I selected it and clicked on the  
restart button.

The iBook restarted to OS-9.2.2 and shows the full contents of the  
hard drive when I open it. The OS-9 startup disk control panel gave  
me the choice of either system folder to boot from. I selected OS-X. 
4.9 and restarted. It booted in OS-X.4.9. It looks like my drag and  
drop procedure worked for me, but I can't promise that it will work  
for you.

I'm not a paper certified tech, just a knowledgeable Mac user who  
does volunteer refurbishing of donated equipment to put into school  
classrooms. My interpretation of the difference is that Apple has  
used the title &quot;Classic&quot; to denote all computers, operating systems,  
and software that is pre-OS-X and that &quot;Native&quot; applies to machines  
that are capable of booting to OS-9. There probably is a true company  
definition of those terms, but I haven't been exposed to it yet. In  
OS-X, programs that are OS-9 or earlier need to have the &quot;Classic&quot;  
environment running in order for the programs to operate, but it is  
not the full version of OS-9 and most of the system processes are  
being handled by OS-X resources.

In the Mac User Group that I am a member of, we use the terms  
interchangeably and usually mean a pre-OS-X item when we say it.
