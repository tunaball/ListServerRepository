<PRE>Interesting comments, Ronald.

I got interested in English and writing clearly in college, and that was 
whetted by working in engineering departments here and there, doing a 
stint in technical writing...all of which has made me more and more of a 
pain in the butt when I read other's writings!
As the years go on, either people are getting more and more sloppy in 
all aspects of their writing, or...I've crossed the line and become way 
too critical in my reading.
I am continually asking (under my breath) what do you MEAN? Define your 
terms, etc. Mumble, mumble...

The use of correct grammar has deteriorated drastically, seems to me. 
Correct spelling is almost non-existent. Complete sentences are no 
longer important.
Ah well, I didn't mean for this to become a rant, but... things aren't 
getting better, are they. &lt;g&gt;

Thanks for a good message on the subject.
