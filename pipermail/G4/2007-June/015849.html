<PRE>Greetings ( + )!( + )

It may have been a &quot;harmless diversion&quot; (diversion Syn: Amusement; 
entertainment; pastime; recreation; sport; game; play; solace; 
merriment) for you however for the rest of us it was a exhibition of 
some English Ph.D.. wannabes extolling (To elevate by praise; to 
eulogize; to praise; to magnify; as, to extol virtue; to extol an act 
or a person [1913 Webster]) their self importance. In other words 
BRAGGING about what they have done in the past.

I find it hard to believe that they understand English, if they did 
they would have read the guidelines of the lowendmac and understood 
that the G4 forum is a place to discuss the Macintosh G4 and not to 
rant on and on and on about what the know about the english language.

Quote from lowendmac;

----------------------------------------------------
Because of our &quot;once removed&quot; rule, occasional discussion of PCI Power 
Macs and clones is acceptable but discouraged. Owners of other Macs are 
encouraged to join the appropriate list from those listed on the right.

Be sure to read our guide to netiquette before posting to the list. If 
you wish to discuss the list rules, please join LEMlists, our 
'meta-list' for discussing the lists and their rules.
----------------------------------------------------

What I don't understand is why the listmom hasn't removed the 
individuals from the list that insist on continuing this dialog. And as 
it says &quot;once removed&quot; your gone. The posters that insist on continuing 
this post also need to read the netiquette guidelines.

6.	Please keep &quot;me too&quot; messages off the list; these are best sent 
privately, if at all.

All most all of the posting under the Subject [G4] English? fall into 
the &quot;me too,&quot; I want to brag about myself and see if you can top that.
----------------------------------------------------

That's my 2 cents and after I send this posting I will be activating 
another &quot;Rules&quot; in my mail preferences to delete all mail that contain 
the subject English. And that is a direct delete, so I will not be 
bothered any longer by the self-proclaimed English professors.

Oh yeah, if I have offended the list I apologies and if I have made 
mistakes in my grammar please feel free to criticize and submit 
correction, as I won't see them because they will be going directly 
into delete.
