It sounds as though you had done everything correctly, so there is no  
reason not to do it again.

I would venture a guess that something happened to the OS-9 drive to  
cause this problem. Either the OS software became corrupt and became  
unable to complete a startup or the drive itself developed a  
mechanical problem.

The easiest way to determine which condition caused the problem is to  
attempt to do a &quot;Clean Install&quot; of OS-9 on the drive. You should use  
the same installation CD that you used before and start the  
installation as normal except that you should check each of the  
option buttons to find the &quot;Clean Install&quot; function. Once you find  
that option, select it and then continue with the installation  
procedure as you did previously.

This will give you a valid operating system on the drive that you can  
boot to. You should be able to locate your original System Folder  
with the new name of &quot;Previous System Folder&quot; in the contents of the  
hard drive. Once you have verified that the new system is working  
properly, you can delete the Previous System Folder safely. Of  
course, you will have to consider reinstalling any third party  
software that you had in the old system onto the new one.

If the installation CD does not find the drive you want to do the  
&quot;Clean Install&quot; onto, then you probably have a dead drive and will  
need to replace it and do all your installations over again onto a  
new drive.

At least, you will have learned how to do a minor trouble-shoot  
procedure. At most, you will have a new drive to play with.
