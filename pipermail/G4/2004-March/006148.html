<PRE>	My G4/400 started giving me a fit yesterday.  I installed a 
game for my son to play.  While he was playing, the computer locked 
up and a bunch of text appeared on the screen on top of the game 
screen.  I restarted the computer and he started playing again, but 
it locked up again.  After that, I decided to un-install the game 
and quit using it.

	Then today, I was ripping a DVD.  The ripping process worked 
fine.  But when I ejected the DVD, it locked up again.  I am starting 
to think it might have something to do with the Pioneer  DVD burner I 
installed a couple of months ago.

	The burner installed with no problems.  ASP showed it as a 
Pioneer DVD burner and as being fully supported.  I burned a couple 
of CD's with it, and watched a couple of DVD's.  However, when I 
tried to eject a DVD, it would not open.  ASP then showed the drive 
as not being supported.  That happened a couple of times.

	This new problem started yesterday.  Every time it happened, 
there was a CD or DVD in the drive.  I don't even know where to begin 
with this problem.  I kind of thought about doing a new install, but 
I am saving that option as a last resort.  Please keep me from having 
to go to the last resort.


Thanks

Kevin
