<PRE>Did anyone else in your household have access to your G4 while you were 
away? It's not very conceivable that another person could have changed 
your password without you knowing or being notified of the change, but 
it is slightly possible if other people know your original password and 
wanted to play with your mind/memory.

You didn't describe your home environment in regarding other persons in 
the house or their proclivity to tricks. Remember that April 1 is 
approaching and there HAVE BEEN a few articles in different magazines 
already about tricks you can play on your &quot;friends and family&quot; that 
won't do damage, just cause consternation and concern.

I normally leave my G4 867MHz Quicksilver running 24/7 with Entourage up
gathering mail every 10 minutes. Last night when I went to check my mail
Entourage had error messages that it couldn't access my .Mac POP mail
account because of a password error. This is strange because I have 
NEVER
changed my password since I signed up for my .Mac account. In fact I 
use the
same password for my user account on my G4 which I NEVER change either.
So I go to my .Mac account and attempt to log on and guess what? It 
says my
password is not correct. I use the birthday/pet name route to change it 
back
to what I thought it always was and my email starts working again.
I would swear on a stack of bibles that I never changed that password, 
I had
no reason to and it was working fine up to some time yesterday 
afternoon. I
know as I get older I may tend to be forgetful, but .Mac sends an email 
when
you change or update your password as insurance against someone hacking 
it.
The only email I can find concerning my changing that password is the 
one I
got when I reset it to my original. It would seem that I should have
received another email in the batch that got downloaded after I reset it
that would ahve alerted me to the change, but I can't find one!
Anyone else ever have a problem with their .Mac password?
