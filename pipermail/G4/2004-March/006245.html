<PRE>Hi all -

Still trying to get my Palm to work with my G4. I was a little less
angry with Palm as a nice Tech guy from the Phillipines spent an
hour with me tonight and at least we got the Desktop software
installed into OS9.2 and it could finally HotSync with the Handheld
for the first time in six months. However, there's still some
problem because it only syncs from the handheld's button -
the Desktop pops up errors that it can't find the HotSync
software.

The Tech had me rebuild Desktop in 9.2 but it didn't seem
to want to - in other words, it never gave the query
&quot;do you want to rebuild the desktop?&quot; while booting
with Cmd +Opt +Restart. So I don't know if it really
did rebuild.

Anyway, when I rebooted into OSX.2 and opened the
Desktop software, lo and behold it opened up an X version
 that will not sync with the handheld.

Question 1: Is there any way to force OSX to open up
the OS9 version in Classic, not the Aqua version? I don't
care if it's the OS9 version in Classic, that would be
just fine and dandy. But I can't seem to get it to open
the 9 version.

I really need my calendar in my face in the morning
and I know I won't bother booting back and forth from
OS9 to X. I am usually in X.

Question 2: What's the equivalent of &quot;rebuild the
Desktop&quot; in OSX?

What I need to do is get the Desktop Software to
&quot;see&quot; the HotSync Manager doohicky. It's right
there in the folder, it's just not communicating with
the main app.

Question 3: Does the following error message ring
a bell with anybody?

&quot;Unexpected error #-50

&quot;Application Launch Failure

&quot;The application &quot;HotSync Manager&quot; could not be
launched because of a shared library error:
&quot;4&lt;HotSync Manager&gt;&lt;HotSync
Manager&gt;&lt;HotSyncLib.PPC&gt;&lt;&gt;&quot;

Many thanks for any ideas.

Maybe I'll call Palm again in the morning - or rather,
the afternoon as they only open 8am Pacific time.
