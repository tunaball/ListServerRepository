<PRE>I currently have the EyeTV that I bought after considering the Miglia 
Alchemy and the Meilenstein Televio TV cards. There are quite a few 
reports on the EyeTV and the Alchemy card on www.xlr8yourmac.com. I 
bought the EyeTV primarily based on reports there that the Alchemy 
card's software is still not very stable and some of the features are 
still marginal. This is similar to what reports were on the EyeTV when 
it came out a couple of years ago. It is probable that the Alchemy card 
has better video (although I have not seen it), but for my purposes I 
don't need high quality as I will not be recording or editing/archiving 
the programs. I will mostly only use it to watch sports in the evenings 
as I work/play on my Mac. The EyeTV software is quite stable and useful 
and the package I bought on eBay included the Keyspan remote, which has 
been handy not only for the EyeTV but for iTunes as well.
There are significant differences in the stored video format between 
the EyeTV and the Alchemy card which also might have a bearing on what 
you would choose, although again, it was not a deciding factor in my 
purchase.
In looking at the MyTV product, I'm not sure it's OS X native, which 
for me would have been a non-starter.

Hope this helps,
Mel
