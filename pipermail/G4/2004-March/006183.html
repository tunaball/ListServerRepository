<PRE>I normally leave my G4 867MHz Quicksilver running 24/7 with Entourage up
gathering mail every 10 minutes. Last night when I went to check my mail
Entourage had error messages that it couldn't access my .Mac POP mail
account because of a password error. This is strange because I have NEVER
changed my password since I signed up for my .Mac account. In fact I use the
same password for my user account on my G4 which I NEVER change either.
So I go to my .Mac account and attempt to log on and guess what? It says my
password is not correct. I use the birthday/pet name route to change it back
to what I thought it always was and my email starts working again.
I would swear on a stack of bibles that I never changed that password, I had
no reason to and it was working fine up to some time yesterday afternoon. I
know as I get older I may tend to be forgetful, but .Mac sends an email when
you change or update your password as insurance against someone hacking it.
The only email I can find concerning my changing that password is the one I
got when I reset it to my original. It would seem that I should have
received another email in the batch that got downloaded after I reset it
that would ahve alerted me to the change, but I can't find one!
Anyone else ever have a problem with their .Mac password?

Joe Ellis
