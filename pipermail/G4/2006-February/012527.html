<PRE>Below is a response to one of the 'off group' notes I've gotten.  I'm 
posting my reply because the shoe may fit others.

=========

My problem is not ordinary...I've spent days with some very bright folks 
and applied countless measures (only to confirm that the Mac is only 
able to get 1/2 the bandwidth of the Winboxes under a controlled 
environment).

Pick a standard for 'research' - - - The Winboxes pass...the G4 fails.

So, yes...'Disk Utiliy' is a daily routine.  A MacDude had me doing it 
from day one...like flossing!

With all due respect?  Your &quot;story&quot; is typical...Most Mac users don't 
have problems and it tends to be a culture where there are fewer people 
who &quot;need&quot; to be code-warriors.  Face it, if one owns an M$ machine and 
does much at all with it?  It's a matter of survival to approach the 
level of a computer engineer.

OTOH?  Not only does that mean there are fewer Mac &quot;owners&quot; who can also 
be of assistance..(that I get!) There tends to be a denial the the 
earned good-fortune is a universal quality, a warranty against a problem.

Thus, there is a difference between &quot;I don't know/I don't care&quot; and 
&quot;You're [me] wrong/not doing enough/I don't believe it/that can't be.&quot;

The only fair response is &quot;Wow, this is really weird...if there's a 
reason, I have no clue for a remedy.&quot;

See, I have some pretty bright contacts?  They have enough humility (and 
know the OS inside-out) to admit this is an anomaly. [abnormality, 
irregularity, inconsistency, incongruity, aberration, quirk, rarity.]
Or, &quot;I've not even heard of &quot;this&quot;.

Plus, though I've only been in this world since last year?  I caught on 
(and being a WinDoer), I prolly have more understanding of the OS than 
my time would suggest.

While I'm  not above/beyond reproach...I've done much research, followed 
any suggestion and have only left the most credible people scratching 
their heads.

I don't want to debate, blame or alienate.  A fix is all I desire.  I 
have no dog in this fight.

I can say that the Mac is a better machine --- But I still own it - - It 
doesn't own me.  It's still a machine and I can't be a zealot or 
crusader -- &amp; I sense that many 'owners' see more of a 'relationship' 
between operator and wires and/or need to (or appear to) deny the 
fragility in any tool.

If I lack the degree of faith (which others can justify) it will only be 
another 'skeptic' who will bail me out.

In other words:
The person who can stand back and not recite 'what should be'...Hey, 
that's gonna be the only way to veer off he course of &quot;abnormality, 
irregularity, inconsistency, incongruity, aberration, quirk, rarity&quot;.

If I find out this is truly 'normal' (typical) or &quot;my fault&quot;...I'll 
admit it.  After several days of dedication to applying all standard 
(and available) advice...I'm still 'stuck'.

Pride, confidence and/or faith are great!
But, I need a solution - - I hope the former aren't preventing me from 
finding objectivity (which is so far in short supply).

Michael
