<PRE>Michael,
                i have had issues with slow speeds with my iISP till i 
threatened legal action and explained that TCIP and ethernet as well as 
ADSL are not platform specific, that is the reason for them being made.
This  action caused the bottle neck to be removed.
you need to supply us some details of your set up and not blabble about 
you have tried everything.

what is your connection...
do you need a script....
how are you testing speed....
is there a router.....
what is the addressing being used.......
what are all your network settings.......
make sure you are not being a victim of sharing turned on.


look forward to your reply

michael

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =========
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My problem is not ordinary...I've spent days with some very bright 
</I>&gt;<i> folks and applied countless measures (only to confirm that the Mac is 
</I>&gt;<i> only able to get 1/2 the bandwidth of the Winboxes under a controlled 
</I>&gt;<i> environment).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pick a standard for 'research' - - - The Winboxes pass...the G4 fails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, yes...'Disk Utiliy' is a daily routine.  A MacDude had me doing it 
</I>&gt;<i> from day one...like flossing!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With all due respect?  Your &quot;story&quot; is typical...Most Mac users don't 
</I>&gt;<i> have problems and it tends to be a culture where there are fewer 
</I>&gt;<i> people who &quot;need&quot; to be code-warriors.  Face it, if one owns an M$ 
</I>&gt;<i> machine and does much at all with it?  It's a matter of survival to 
</I>&gt;<i> approach the level of a computer engineer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH?  Not only does that mean there are fewer Mac &quot;owners&quot; who can 
</I>&gt;<i> also be of assistance..(that I get!) There tends to be a denial the 
</I>&gt;<i> the earned good-fortune is a universal quality, a warranty against a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, there is a difference between &quot;I don't know/I don't care&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You're [me] wrong/not doing enough/I don't believe it/that can't be.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only fair response is &quot;Wow, this is really weird...if there's a 
</I>&gt;<i> reason, I have no clue for a remedy.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See, I have some pretty bright contacts?  They have enough humility 
</I>&gt;<i> (and know the OS inside-out) to admit this is an anomaly. 
</I>&gt;<i> [abnormality, irregularity, inconsistency, incongruity, aberration, 
</I>&gt;<i> quirk, rarity.]
</I>&gt;<i> Or, &quot;I've not even heard of &quot;this&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, though I've only been in this world since last year?  I caught 
</I>&gt;<i> on (and being a WinDoer), I prolly have more understanding of the OS 
</I>&gt;<i> than my time would suggest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I'm  not above/beyond reproach...I've done much research, 
</I>&gt;<i> followed any suggestion and have only left the most credible people 
</I>&gt;<i> scratching their heads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to debate, blame or alienate.  A fix is all I desire.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> have no dog in this fight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can say that the Mac is a better machine --- But I still own it - - 
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't own me.  It's still a machine and I can't be a zealot or 
</I>&gt;<i> crusader -- &amp; I sense that many 'owners' see more of a 'relationship' 
</I>&gt;<i> between operator and wires and/or need to (or appear to) deny the 
</I>&gt;<i> fragility in any tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I lack the degree of faith (which others can justify) it will only 
</I>&gt;<i> be another 'skeptic' who will bail me out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words:
</I>&gt;<i> The person who can stand back and not recite 'what should be'...Hey, 
</I>&gt;<i> that's gonna be the only way to veer off he course of &quot;abnormality, 
</I>&gt;<i> irregularity, inconsistency, incongruity, aberration, quirk, rarity&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I find out this is truly 'normal' (typical) or &quot;my fault&quot;...I'll 
</I>&gt;<i> admit it.  After several days of dedication to applying all standard 
</I>&gt;<i> (and available) advice...I'm still 'stuck'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pride, confidence and/or faith are great!
</I>&gt;<i> But, I need a solution - - I hope the former aren't preventing me from 
</I>&gt;<i> finding objectivity (which is so far in short supply).
