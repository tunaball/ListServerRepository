Just remember that you can move your current file to the trash (without 
deleting them) which will make them unavailable to the iPhoto 
application and then try opening your pictures before deleting them 
from the trash.

I moved my iTunes file to a different drive some time ago and deleted 
the file that was originally used, OOPS the file on the other drive 
turned out to be only a link back to the original file, which was not 
deleted. Fortunately there wasn't a lot of &quot;Tunes&quot; in the file and the 
only ones that were purchased were ones that were for my granddaughter 
and she had already moved them from her iPod to her wintel. We learned 
a lesson there, since the iPod had been initialized on the Mac, nothing 
worked when she connected it to the PC. We found out that if you do the 
original initialization on the PC then the Mac can work with that 
format, however the PC can't work with the Mac format.
