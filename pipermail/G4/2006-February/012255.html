At risk of sounding a bit rude, anything that depends on a floppy drive is
so old that you might consider that you have gotten your moneys worth out of
it many times over, and perhaps it is time to upgrade to a more recent
version that is made for a modern operating system.

The problem with older programs is that each OS upgrade incrementally makes
more and more changes away from that which a particular program is made for.
When you install a program the backwards compatibility is stated, but since
the future is unknowable a future OS compatibility is not stated. However
eventually there will be a limit. You may well have reached that point
despite 'classic'.

As someone who came along after the introduction of OS X I have never really
understood the holding on to OS 9 programs that occurs. So far as I can tell
OS 9 is a limited and unpleasant to use system better avoided where
possible. Still familiarity is important, and I can understand that sadness
that comes when for instance an old pair of shoes has to be thrown out.

It usually takes a little while, but usually you reach a point where you
wondered why it took so long to make the change.

My apologies for the philosophical answer in the absence of any solutions
that get the program you choose working. Best of luck.
