One tip that I can add, have you tried on your computer making a new  
User login and see if the slower results are there for that user too?  
To see if the issue is user directory based or something more with  
system files...


What test are you doing again? Has anyone else on the list did test  
like this recently???

If you must have the issue resolved then go to the source by  
contacting Apple on the issue, it might be the best solution in this  
case.

If you recently bought Mac os 10.4 you have a warrantee period of  
free support, and even if not  they still might help you some on this  
issue. Give them a call and see what happens.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My problem is not ordinary...I've spent days with some very bright  
</I>&gt;<i> folks and applied countless measures (only to confirm that the Mac

</I>&gt;<i> So, yes...'Disk Utiliy' is a daily routine.  A MacDude had me doing

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With all due respect?  Your &quot;story&quot; is typical...Most Mac users  
</I>&gt;<i> don't have problems and it tends to be a culture where there are  
</I>&gt;<i> fewer people who &quot;need&quot; to be code-warriors.  Face it, if one owns  
</I>&gt;<i> an M$ machine and does much at all with it?  It's a matter of  
</I>&gt;<i> survival to approach the level of a computer engineer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH?  Not only does that mean there are fewer Mac &quot;owners&quot; who can  
</I>&gt;<i> also be of assistance..(that I get!) There tends to be a denial the  
</I>&gt;<i> the earned good-fortune is a universal quality, a warranty against  
</I>&gt;<i> a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, there is a difference between &quot;I don't know/I don't care&quot; and  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You're [me] wrong/not doing enough/I don't believe it/that can't be.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only fair response is &quot;Wow, this is really weird...if there's a  
</I>&gt;<i> reason, I have no clue for a remedy.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See, I have some pretty bright contacts?  They have enough humility  
</I>&gt;<i> (and know the OS inside-out) to admit this is an anomaly.  
</I>&gt;<i> [abnormality, irregularity, inconsistency, incongruity, aberration,  
</I>&gt;<i> quirk, rarity.]
</I>&gt;<i> Or, &quot;I've not even heard of &quot;this&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, though I've only been in this world since last year?  I  
</I>&gt;<i> caught on (and being a WinDoer), I prolly have more understanding  
</I>&gt;<i> of the OS than my time would suggest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I'm  not above/beyond reproach...I've done much research,  
</I>&gt;<i> followed any suggestion and have only left the most credible people  
</I>&gt;<i> scratching their heads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to debate, blame or alienate.  A fix is all I desire.   
</I>&gt;<i> I have no dog in this fight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can say that the Mac is a better machine --- But I still own it -  
</I>&gt;<i> - It doesn't own me.  It's still a machine and I can't be a zealot  
</I>&gt;<i> or crusader -- &amp; I sense that many 'owners' see more of a  
</I>&gt;<i> 'relationship' between operator and wires and/or need to (or appear  
</I>&gt;<i> to) deny the fragility in any tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I lack the degree of faith (which others can justify) it will  
</I>&gt;<i> only be another 'skeptic' who will bail me out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words:
</I>&gt;<i> The person who can stand back and not recite 'what should  
</I>&gt;<i> be'...Hey, that's gonna be the only way to veer off he course of  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;abnormality, irregularity, inconsistency, incongruity, aberration,  
</I>&gt;<i> quirk, rarity&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I find out this is truly 'normal' (typical) or &quot;my fault&quot;...I'll  
</I>&gt;<i> admit it.  After several days of dedication to applying all  
</I>&gt;<i> standard (and available) advice...I'm still 'stuck'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pride, confidence and/or faith are great!
</I>&gt;<i> But, I need a solution - - I hope the former aren't preventing me  
</I>&gt;<i> from finding objectivity (which is so far in short supply).
