Skid I have never had a floppy in my hands and really don't know what they
look like :-) Somehow I don't think I missed anything, however they are not
the only thing that is fragile in regard to storage.

Long term storage on CD is not as long term as people think, and there is a
vast difference in longevity between brands. There are 2 factors: Most
important is the dye layer required for reading the data. Most companies use
cheap dyes in the dye layer that change with time producing errors in
reading or complete failure eventually. The cheap CD's bought in packs of 20
or 50 in discount stores may have an effective storage life of as little as
1 or 2 years. At the other end of the scale a Sony CD-R that incorporates
'Supremas Technology' has a far longer life due to better dyes. Sony also
claims that it uses a plastic that burns with a sharper edge, again reducing
error rates.(the second factor being the quality and shape of the burnt
'pits' in the CD)

It is very likely the trouble you have with CD's working is due to this
quality issue. I for one only buy the Sony ones for archival use.

Considering how many people use CD's for long term storage it is amazing how
little discussion of these issues occur. I guess people don't realise that
not all CD's are equal.
