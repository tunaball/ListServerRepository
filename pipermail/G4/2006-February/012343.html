<PRE>Buy a new scanner.  Umax stopped supporting all their scanners about 7 
years ago - as soon as their licensing ran out.  The biggest problem 
with the scanner is not the SCSI connection, but rather the lack of 
drivers.

The SCSI card is about $60 - $70 but the scanner driver (VueScan) is 
another $50 - $90.  A new USB scanner is only $60 - $80 and there are 
probably some that are even cheaper - look for a sale.

Sounds ridiculous because your Umax scanner would last another 20 
years, but with absolutely no support from the manufacturer it is 
useless.  I will never personally deal with Umax again, as they totally 
abandoned the Mac market and their customers the moment they could no 
longer sell new hardware.  They had an interest only for the fast 
money.
