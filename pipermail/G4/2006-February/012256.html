FWIW I still use a lot of Classic programs on my G4 (OS 9.2.2/OS X 
10.3.9) and have yet to find a major one which doesn't work. That 
includes Excel, a 14 year old accounting program, and more 
importantly, Photoshop 5. In that respect I think Apple have done a 
pretty reasonable job on backward compatibility, tho' this won't be 
the case with the new Intel machines which won't run Classic at all.

So sorry, I can't help with the Excel problem. Mine (in Office 2001) 
works fine.

I take the point, but I've never changed simply for change's sake. 
Apart from anything else I have two OS 9 Macs hooked up via Ethernet 
to the OS X G4 (a Pismo Powerbook G3 and a beige G3, both of which 
work fine, and will print over a shared USB network).

The reason for retaining the old beige Mac is simply that I have a 
lot of good SCSI hardware hooked up to it (two scanners and a disk 
burner) which I'm loath to junk simply because the G4 doesn't support 
it. As exchanging files between networked Macs is a breeze, I might 
as well go with what I've got.

BTW I certainly wouldn't categorise OS 9 as 'unpleasant'. A bit 
clunky maybe compared with OS X, but I've been using Macs since 
Multifinder was a big innovation!

Best

Alex
