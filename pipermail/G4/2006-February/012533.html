Ergonomics is more than just a chair.

It is the complete setup from where the monitor is located to the 
type of Keyboard tray the keyboard is sitting to the type of mouse or 
track ball to the chair and one of the thing tha most people forget, 
espeicially for those entering Presbyopia (needing bifocals or 
trifocals) the type of glass you wear.


&gt;<i>Hi all -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Being one year shy of 50, it would seem that things are breaking 
</I>&gt;<i>down a tad. To wit, I need a more comfortable office chair. Having 
</I>&gt;<i>been to Staples and surfed a bit on the net, it would seem that some 
</I>&gt;<i>chairs offer various features that are supposed to provide support.
</I>

Most of the chairs in staples are not ergonomic as at best they allow 
for height and maybe one or two other adjustments.

A good chair to look at is the Aeron by Herman Miller it come in 
three sizes and and the smaller size should fit you.  Next is the 
keyboard tray thet you have your keyboard on adjustable in height ( 
the height from the floor to the keyboard should be between 24-28&quot; 
average is 26&quot; for people from 5'2&quot; to 6'2&quot;) and angle? the angle of 
your elbows should be at 90 degrees and their should be no break in 
your wrists when you type. Is you manual input device in the proper 
location (your mouse or trackball).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Some of these are a tilt lever, so you can lean back a bit, a 
</I>&gt;<i>forward-backward adjustable lever on the back, and of course and up 
</I>&gt;<i>and down lever. There's a pretty good chair at Staples with 
</I>&gt;<i>adjustable arms I'm considering for $129. (never spent so much on a 
</I>&gt;<i>chair! altho you can spend $500 on an ergonomic chair if you want 
</I>&gt;<i>to!)
</I>

You can spend upto $1200 for a fully funcitional ergonomic chair and 
most are worth the cost?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My problems are I'm a bit short, so if I'm sitting right in front of 
</I>&gt;<i>my Mac LCD monitor (top of frame at eyebrow level)
</I>
it is not to the top of the frame but to the top of the screen.  The 
reason for this is that human beings actually look at a 15 degree 
down angle when looking straight ahead

&gt;<i>to avoid neck strain, my chair has to be high enuf so I have to put 
</I>&gt;<i>my feet on two fat books. I'm still getting some neck strain, tho - 
</I>&gt;<i>keyboard too low? Need arms on the chair?
</I>

One of the bigest reasons for neck strain in people of your age is 
their glasses.  They try to use the same bifocal or invisible lenes 
that they use for walking to work on their computer.  Because the 
near or intermediate portion of the lens is set for comfort when 
reading when you use it to look at the computer screen you are 
bending your neck in an unnatural manner giving you neck pain and 
perhaps permanent damage

&gt;<i>Any of you who are of similar age or condition, please email me for 
</I>&gt;<i>a date (just kidding!) no please email me with your adventures and 
</I>&gt;<i>what you finally purchased that was good. And yes, I'm exercising 
</I>&gt;<i>and doing yoga.
</I>&gt;<i>
