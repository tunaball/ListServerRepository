<PRE>Did you try to re-start  the mac and see if the network speed  
improves, it might be one of those things that happens after a  
computer has been on for some time...

</I>&gt;<i> If it's been running for months at 6+MB/s....It seems risky to

</I>&gt;<i> losing 1/2 of my DL speed in one day.
</I>&gt;<i> (I did connect the G4 directly to the modem...same, same...So that  
</I>&gt;<i> takes the router out of he equation, and the same modem is OK with  
</I>&gt;<i> the Winboxes?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was leaning toward a &quot;Network&quot; 'setting/file/code/config' which  
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;stuck&quot; (and I don't know it).
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not a Unix type?  I see a lot of files/folders which perform  
</I>&gt;<i> functions &amp; unlike the bizarre M$ registry, it isn't always clear  
</I>&gt;<i> what functions these particular 'files' influence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I'm thinking it's prolly more simple than not? As bizarre as it  
</I>&gt;<i> is (one machine on a LAN dropping DL by 1/2 - - in a day?) -- I  
</I>&gt;<i> gotta believe its code/config related - -  some pref/config/file is  
</I>&gt;<i> either wrong or in the way (should have been ditched &amp; is hanging  
</I>&gt;<i> around).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, what's left if we eliminate the router, modem (as probs)  
</I>&gt;<i> and have two other boxes running at full speed (and the G4 'did'  
</I>&gt;<i> until Friday)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still think the craziest thing is I have alot of speed (2MB/s  
</I>&gt;<i> ain't shabby!) - - - It's just that it was getting 6+ as the  
</I>&gt;<i> Winboxes still are.  Yeah, if it totally blinked out - - - That  
</I>&gt;<i> would make sense...It's too bizarre that it hits the wall at 2MB/s....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keep dem brains workin'....I'm outta tricks and the link provided
