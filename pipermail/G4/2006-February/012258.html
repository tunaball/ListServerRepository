No apologies needed. I didn't report the whole story.  I use databases most of the time and spreadsheets very little.  I need Excel on the G4 in order to convert some of my old spreadsheet files to a format that can be imported by my OS X spreadsheet program.  I saved a lot of the old files in slyk format because I thought it would be the most transferrable but it doesn't work and I need to go back and save them in Excel format.  I really can't justify the cost of MS Excel or Office for the little use I would have for it.  The old versions were bought for work before I retired 10 to 15 years ago.

I have tried NeoOffice several times ( including the newest) and strangely enough, it will import my Lotus files but will not import my Excel 4 files or SLYK files.  Also I really don't like the user interface very much, especially the finder integration (Open file, etc).  Once you get over the steep learning curve, I much prefer using Ragtime Solo (also free) as a replacement for Word and Excel.
