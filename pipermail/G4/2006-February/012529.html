<PRE>Greetings ( + )!( + )

Just a thought that you might want to try. Perhaps the PC, whether it 
is one of your window box's or the Mac that establishes the first 
connection to the ISP is controlling the connection speed.

So;
1st: Power down all of your computing equipment.
2nd: Power down your cable modem (remove power) and disconnect the 
cable.
3rd: Reconnect the cable to the modem and then power-up the modem and 
wait until it has established a solid and stable connection with the 
ISP.
4th: Power-up your Mac and make a connection with your ISP and then 
check you bandwidth.
5th: Power-up your window box's and check their bandwidth.

</I>&gt;<i> (I did connect the G4 directly to the modem...same, same...So that

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, what's left if we eliminate the router, modem (as probs) and 
</I>&gt;<i> have two other boxes running at full speed (and the G4 'did' until

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still think the craziest thing is I have alot of speed (2MB/s ain't
