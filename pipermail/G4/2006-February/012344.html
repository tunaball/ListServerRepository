<PRE>Hello,

I need some advice on how to implement the &quot;swapping &quot; of info from 
drives.  Here's the current setup

Power Mac G4/466 Digital Audio

Drive 1
-boot drive - 30 gig internal boot drive
-5 gig partition that contains OS 9.2 and some 9.2 apps that I still use
-25 gig partition that contains OS 10.3.9 along with all user folders, 
applications and several thousand photos.
-this drive is almost full

Drive 2 - 40 gig internal drive
-unpartitioned
-contains iTunes music folder currently at about 20 gigs.

Drive 3
-250 gig external drive connected via USB 2.0
Contains mostly video files

The short version is I want the 40 gig drive to contain the operating 
systems, user folders and apps and the 30 gig drive to contain the 
iTunes music folders. The easy part is temporarily  moving the iTunes 
music folder to the external drive. I need to back that up anyway so a 
copy will stay there. Now the 40 gig drive will be empty and the 
questions begin.

Should I reformat the 40 gig before I procede? Do I need to have OS9 in 
a separate partition for OS X? I don't really boot up in 9. I just run 
classic for the few apps that I still use. If I do go with a partition 
does it matter which is first on the drive?

Can I simply copy disk 1 to disk 2? If disk 2 is partitioned do I copy 
partition A to A and B to B or will it just figure that out itself? Can 
I just copy each partition to disk two and expect everything to work 
out OK. Once everything is on disk 2  do I need to physically swap the 
hard drives inside the G4 or can I just reset the jumpers for master 
and slave or do I need to swap drive locations and switch the jumpers?

Backing up. Does OS 10.3 have a built in back up feature? I think it 
would be a good idea to back up disk 1 before I do anything just incase 
there is a failure in the process. In fact since disk real estate is 
cheap and available I should keep it backed up anyway. This begs 
another questions. Should I partition the external drive to have a 
partition for iTunes music, video and a back up of the boot drive? The 
only advantage I see is that video editing might run faster. I could 
also setup a scratch disk for photoshop but I am not really a power 
user so that might be overkill.

Any advice on a better way or faster way of doing this would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks
Chris
