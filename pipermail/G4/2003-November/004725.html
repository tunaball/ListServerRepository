<PRE>Don't forget memory. Memory is probably THE least reliable in computers 
today. In some 16-17 years with Macs, I've never lost a monitor. Power 
supplies yes, but only in my old Mac Plus from about 17 years ago. :-) 
It still runs to this day. Mac OS 7.5..Ah..the good days when a 200MB 
hard drive was considered HUGE and an entire bootable OS would fit on a 
floppy. For hard drives, I have 8 macs running here, and in 16 years 
had to replace about 3-4 hard drives. Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones. 
Or they just don't make them like they used to.  Ah, my mac plus with 
the fishbowl monitor, god I love that computer :-).
