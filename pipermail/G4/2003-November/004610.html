Please send a report later about the sawtooth, I am very interested. 
I am currently running 10.1.5 on my sawtooth (single processor, 500 
MHz, 896 MB RAM) but will hopefully recieve Panther tomorrow, so I am 
very curious on how and if this mac will benefit from Panther or not. 
I haven't upgraded the graphic card, that's still original, so I 
guess the graphics won't be much faster...

Question is if I should make a totally new installation of Panther or 
install it over 10.1.5?? (Of course making a backup first...)

Thanks for all info on how this new OS works with my old mac.

/ Vicki
