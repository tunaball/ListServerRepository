<PRE>how exactly are you securing the video camera in your car? i have used 
my sony DVR-25 blah blah blah (cant remember the exact model) miniDV 
camcorder ($600?) from b&amp;h) in my car for races for quite a while, and 
it still looks pretty much brand new and works like the day i bought it.

the camera is, of course, mounted on a welded tripod head and doesnt 
move a bit while the car is in motion.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We really only use the camcorder for capturing in-car video of our 
</I>&gt;<i> road racing. Quite frankly, the cameras get the cr*p beat out of them. 
</I>&gt;<i> This Sony Handycam that we've been using has lasted the longest of all 
</I>&gt;<i> of them (all have been Sonys). Usually they suffer from a cracked 
</I>&gt;<i> board. Even this one has its moments, there are times when it just 
</I>&gt;<i> stops recording and once the zoom locked on full (got 10 mins of the 
</I>&gt;<i> roof of the car and sky before it went back to where we put it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So we can't justify buying a new digital camera only to kill it (but 
</I>&gt;<i> do look on ebay for the older Handycams when we can). Good lipstick 
</I>&gt;<i> cameras, while sweet and sturdy, are again expensive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gotta put it into perspective: $500 is a full set of race tires and my 
</I>&gt;<i> last set lasted a whole season plus the few events I did this year.  
</I>&gt;<i> ;)  If I put $4000 into a video system that I don't make a living on, 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not racing for a *long* time. Hell, my race car didn't even cost 
</I>&gt;<i> that much and I managed to make it street legal as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now I capture with my PM6500 using the old TV/video card from my 
</I>&gt;<i> old 638CD. I get close to 30FPS and it's not too bad, although the 
</I>&gt;<i> size does seem limited (unless I missed another setting). Once I get 
</I>&gt;<i> it on the computer I can use QT6 or even iMovie to manipulate or 
</I>&gt;<i> export it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was just hoping to find something a little more up-to-date to use on 
</I>&gt;<i> my dual 1.42 MDD, preferably in the close to $100 range. It would be 
</I>&gt;<i> nice to get something that will give me a larger image size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everything goes obsolete as soon as you buy it, however I've gotten 8 
</I>&gt;<i> years out of the current card so I can't complain.  I do this for our 
</I>&gt;<i> own pleasure, not for a living. Sorry if I offended you by sounding 
</I>&gt;<i> cheap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will look into the Sony media converter.
</I>&gt;<i>
