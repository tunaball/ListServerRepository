<PRE>actually, that is exactly what would mess things up. for instance, to 
be able to be properly spec'ed as PC100 ram, the DRAM must run at at 
least 8 ns , so the 10 ns ram that the original poster had wouldnt even 
meet the PC100 specs of the first G4s produced.  hence, problems will 
abound.

as far as OS X being much more picky about ram, it is to an extent, but 
more so this is due to the fact that OS X uses almost all your ram at 
all times (especially if you have under 1 GB) any free ram available, 
the system will pick up for disk cache, etc. so in essence, OS X is 
much more likely to find hidden ram errors than OS 9 just because it 
uses the ram much more robustly.

as far as memory testers, most are fairly high level testers (hence 
they are also fairly quick) a full test of ram could take days, and the 
number of different combinations that an OS could send to ram is 
enormous, and it could easily be that only one particular combination, 
or one specific order of combinations actually causes the ram to fail.  
thus since OS 9 didnt use ram nearly as extensively as OS X, it wasnt 
until OS X that people started to realize their crap ram....
