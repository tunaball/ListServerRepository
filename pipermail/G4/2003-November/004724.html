<PRE>Nat-

Like Joe, I'm successfully using my Quicksilver as a base station for 
my Dell laptop. I'm not sure if you can use more than one device at a 
time with a G4 base station, but I imagine it'd work. Setting it up was 
fairly simple, though I wouldn't recommend it unless you know a little 
bit about TCP/IP. You need to configure your wireless devices and the 
Airport card in the G4 with static IP addresses, since the software 
base station doesn't support DHCP. The trickiest part was getting 
encryption to work, though I found the right way to do it after some 
research. If you have any questions about any particulars, feel free to 
e-mail me.
