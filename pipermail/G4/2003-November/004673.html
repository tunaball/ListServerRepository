But we really weren't talking about cameras. Youu askede about a USB 
interface for your video  in order to avoid the expensive cards. That 
is not prferable. A n analog to firewire unit is what you want. If you 
don't think so , you are just being obtuse.
And from the pro video angle $300 is lot a lot of money.

&gt;<i> Gotta put it into perspective: $500 is a full set of race tires and my

If you want to edit the video and do it semi-right. Then you are going 
to have to bite te bullet.
  Buying a mac when you have an older camcorder, makes a convereter 
necessary.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now I capture with my PM6500 using the old TV/video card from my 
</I>&gt;<i> old 638CD. I get close to 30FPS and it's not too bad, although the 
</I>&gt;<i> size does seem limited (unless I missed another setting). Once I get 
</I>&gt;<i> it on the computer I can use QT6 or even iMovie to manipulate or 
</I>&gt;<i> export it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> I was just hoping to find something a little more up-to-date to use on 
</I>&gt;<i> my dual 1.42 MDD, preferably in the close to $100 range. It would be 
</I>&gt;<i> nice to get something that will give me a larger image size.
</I>
So let me get this straight. You bought an expensive computer , ahave 
an old camcorder and refuse to put out n more than $100 to fill the 
gap. OBTUSE.
had you bought a single processor you could have afforded the media 
converter and not look so foolish to people like me.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everything goes obsolete as soon as you buy it, however I've gotten 8 
</I>&gt;<i> years out of the current card so I can't complain.  I do this for our 
</I>&gt;<i> own pleasure, not for a living. Sorry if I offended you by sounding 
</I>&gt;<i> cheap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will look into the Sony media converter.
</I>
Out of produuction . Ther's a Formac , a canopus, a miglio several 
others including Dazzle. You don't offend me . Just bemuse. t
