You should call your representatives and tell them you support
the bill. Today.

What kills me is that people don't call, don't vote. If we are going
to have a national policy, let it at least be what Americans want.
I've been as bad as anyone - I always vote but I'm not always
informed.

Yes - I would say a third party, a practical party that does not
adhere to ideology but works on practical solutions to problems.

In the interim, we need to let who's in there know we're watching
them.

Please do reconsider, though. Present-day HMOs give people the
WORST care. Why are they going to do a better job for seniors?
The whole point of a profit-making operation is to make a profit.
The only way they can do this is to deny benefits as often as
possible. And to get rid of the chronically ill as fast as possible.
(Yank their premiums so they can afford to stay on.)

The only trouble with Medicare IMHO is the trouble with the rest
of the budgets. Americans somehow seem to think they can get
good government for free. I don't think so. We have to pay for
it. The main problem, waste, can be solved by oversight. With
the internet, I think we can start as citizens to actually track
what these people are doing with our money and get efficient
use.

Medicare is a great program. But not if we kill it.
