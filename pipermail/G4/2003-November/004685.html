What you are missing is that I don't do video for a living, so that 
was not what I was looking for what I bought the machine. I don't buy 
PC's either.  ;)

I actually had bought a lower model just before they announced the 
new ones and qualified for the trade-in. The only reason I bought 
when I did (I was expecting new products and price drops in the 
summer, not winter) was because the logicboard on my Yikes! gave up 
the ghost one night with no warning. I was planning on buying a new 
machine in the summer, just got a head start on it. One of the best 
purchases I have made.

Have you used the Dazzle? I found a forum where many said they 
weren't happy with it.


BTW, I like to be called &quot;frugal&quot;  ;)
