</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No reason why you can't with the PC, don't know what a Tungsten C is. As far
as the PC is concerned it may depend on what version of Windows you are
using. From what I've seen and heard M$'s &quot;home&quot; versions of Windows ME and
XP home have their networking functions severely crippled, The full version
of Win 98, 2000, and XP should work just fine. Since you are using 10.2.6
you can use Samba to share folders on on them with your Macs.
