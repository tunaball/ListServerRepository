<PRE>I do volunteer work with Computers for Classrooms, Inc., in Chico, CA. This 
organization takes donated computer equipment (PC and Mac) from government 
agencies, private corporations, and individuals.

The equipment is refurbished completely, an OS  and some free-ware programs 
are installed, and then it is given to local schools at as low a cost as 
possible (usually just the cost of RAM upgrades or NIC cards). Some of the equipment 
is also made available to low-income families who cannot afford to buy a new 
computer (their cost is $60.00 to $75.00 depending on the machines available).

Computers for Classrooms is only one of many such organizations that are 
doing this type of service. Check with your county or state waste management 
offices for information on programs in your area. 

You can help reduce or eliminate the use of land-fill facilities and provide 
equipment to schools and families who need, want, or cannot normally afford to 
pay full price for the gear. You can benefit our ecology and help other pe
ople at the same time.

Have a safe day.

</PRE>
