<PRE>     This is getting way off topic, but I just wanted to respond to 
all the people who kept the thread going....

     Deal. And thanks for your vote of confidence: we don't always 
know if folks really want their tax $ spent this way. We certainly 
appreciate it.

     Well, I was assuming universities (even the ones on Abilene, with 
OC-48 switches), were saturated with downloads of questionable 
legality ;-) In fact, I was assuming most folks are limited to &quot;high 
speed&quot; bandwidths at home of 1.5 Mbps or so, which is what I have at 
home. Not that I wouldn't mind a 10 GigE pipe to my home....

     You're very welcome, and thank you, too, for providing the tax $ 
that let us do things like this.
