<PRE>It is mounted to a platform that is welded to the cage. We use a 
piece of rubber between the two. We do have one of the &quot;official&quot; 
mounts but have not used it in awhile, no, I take that back. The 
official mount was used in his car and I have the platform, we only 
have one official mounting system.

We have also used the cameras in headlights and on the rocker panels, 
many moons ago when they were on the way out. They get less abuse 
inside the cars but do still get knocked around some.

The camera doesn't move in the car but is still subjected to the 
gforces and occasional run over the birms (or worse yet, when one 
completely overshoots the birms and goes off-roading).

What form of racing do you do? Rallying is about the hardest on a camera.

&gt;<i>how exactly are you securing the video camera in your car? i have

</I>&gt;<i>the camera is, of course, mounted on a welded tripod head and doesnt
