<PRE>I know this is way OT, but it's critical we all stand up
for what we believe in. If you're for the bills, let them
know. If you're against, let them know. Do your own
research. Call tomorrow, as these come up for a
vote ASAP. My opinion stands below.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If you're a Democrat, an Independent, a Moderate Republican,
a Libertarian - or just about anyone who's not Radical Right,
it's time to stand up and be counted.

Two bills are up before Congress and are about to be
passed perhaps as early as tomorrow. One is the Energy
Bill and the other is the Medicare Bill. The former gives
huge tax breaks to the oil, gas and coal industry without
doing one substantial thing to reduce our oil dependency.

The latter begins the privatization of Medicare.

Please don't waste time arguing with me. Do your own
research starting with the following links, and then go
directly to the following site to find your representatives
and call them and let them know you want a filibuster
of these dreadful pieces of legislation.

Time is of the essence. You must act tomorrow to have
any impact. If you disagree with me, of course you should
call and say you support these bills.

Don't waste any time, here, though. Just go and do it.
