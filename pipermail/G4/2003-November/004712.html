Subject: [G4] Wanting to go wireless!


&gt;<i> I've got a G4 867, a Blueberry iBook with airport card slot (no card), a
</I>pc
&gt;<i> laptop with PCMCIA card slot and a Tungsten-C with WiFi built in.  I want
</I>to
&gt;<i> connect everything in my household.  What are my best options?  I've heard
</I>&gt;<i> of compatible cards but can I use them in my G4?  It takes the older type
</I>&gt;<i> Airport card.  I'd like to go with a more inexpensive access point because
</I>&gt;<i> the Airport Extreme base station is so expensive.  Has anybody got the
</I>same
&gt;<i> type of set up that you have working to your satisfaction?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I just wanted to connect the PC laptop to the Tungsten C for now until
</I>I
&gt;<i> save up for an Airport base station, does that need an access point if a
</I>&gt;<i> card has a built-in antennae?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The Airport card for your G4 is fairly inexpensive, the cage and antenna
should already be there. If I were you, I would install that first. You
don't say what OS you are using, if it's OS X you can configure your G4 as a
base station for your other machines and you don't need the ABS at least to
start. I ran my G4 as a base station for a while when my ABS went down and I
was waiting for a replacement. I think you can also do that in OS 9 but it's
been so long since I used 9; I don't remember for sure.
