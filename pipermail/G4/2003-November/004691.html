<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>What you are missing is that I don't do video for a living, so that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>was not what I was looking for what I bought the machine. I don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>buy PC's either.  ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It is still twice what you need. But that's cool.
</I>
Maybe. But it won't obsolete as quickly.  :)  One of the only reasons 
I upgraded my old SE (1987-1993) was because the following year 
MacInTax was going to be color only - horrors! Then the PM6500 in 98 
as it was a good close-out deal (which still runs my vinyl cutter), 
then the Yikes! in 2001, another good deal from a vendor of mine, 
that one is now running OS9 and will be later running bookkeeping and 
other stuff for my business. The MDD is for everything else.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Me too . But using USB into a dual 1.42 just seems wrong. All your 
</I>&gt;<i>apps expect firewire.
</I>
Yes they do! So I'm still poking around, this isn't an urgent need for me.

Do any of the USB ones use USB2? I didn't see any that specified that 
so I'm guessing they don't.

I also found references to ATI PCI units that were Mac compatible, so 
I'll have to see if I actually have one here. Though I suppose I'd 
still need the software from ATI to do the capture, I'm sure iMovie 
won't even see it. More research......


&gt;&gt;<i>BTW, I like to be called &quot;frugal&quot;  ;)
</I>&gt;<i>and I like to be called &quot;poor&quot; :(
</I>
LOL. Like it or not I always feel poor.
