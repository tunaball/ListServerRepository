<PRE>i have done a few rally races, but not in my current car. currently i 
do a lot of PCA track/DE events/hill climbs/TracQuest events - just 
getting a feel for the new car, then besides that, there is on road 
races between friends...=)  and maybe sometime in the future a few 
cannonball runs (the wife is highly interested in these-she wants to 
drive)

  i seriously have more problems with using my camera for &quot;normal&quot; 
filming than from in the car.  its been dropped from 10 feet off the 
ground (onto dirt), bumped and banged, etc. in the car it's perfect 
through everything. hell, i have even hooked it up in my friend's CJ-7 
for some great off road shoots.  the cameras really should be fine if 
mounted properly.

as far as outside the car, most people i know who use such systems pay 
a hefty fee, and  replace them at least once per racing season-its just 
more abuse than you can shake a stick at.
