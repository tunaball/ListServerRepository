<PRE>Ok I have been practically laughing at this thread...

from what I understand, 2/3 of the posters may or may not know what  
they are yakking about.
Second most people are from the school of thought that Wiggling,  
Jiggling or whacking the cord or monitor will remedy the situation.
And some even go so far to suggest the Average person put on their  
surgical gloves and fool around inside the computer Monitor. LOL  
electrical surgery. That should be fun... Hope you enjoy losing your  
Limbs when they fry on your limp electrocuted body.

Here's my 2&#162;.

The Thing doesn't work. Its either on its last leg or its close to  
being dead. 99% of the electronic Crap in the last 4 years was  
designed to work for 6 months. Sorry. but thats Life. Deal with it.

Go dig up some coins from under the couch and buy a new CRT.

Since LCD's are all the rage, getting a CRT isn't hard. I work with  
graphics almost every day for my home office graphics business. I buy  
the best gear to do the job... One reason I got a Mac and am on this  
List. Buying the best doesn't mean I gotta waste my money.

Go to Costco, or Sam's Club, or Large Mart or Buy More and get a new  
CRT. 19&quot; isn't too shabby. Doesn't matter the brand, most will have a  
VGA plug or DVI plug.

Buy, Plug in, and enjoy.

P.S. A lot of what I wrote is sarcastic. If you are overtly offended,  
Sorry. But this thread has gotten weird to read.

Peace,

Luke Rademacher
