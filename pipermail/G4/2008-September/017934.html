<PRE>Shopdog.

I have both a 100MB Zip drive and a 250MB Zip drive. I have not used  
either in almost 3 years. Why? because USB Flash Drives hold 10x more  
at a fraction of the cost.

Get yourself a USB2 PCI card and put in your Mac. Then goto almost  
any Retail store and buy a 1GB , 2GB, or even a 4GB USB2 Flash drive  
for LESS than $30.
The USB Flash Drive does not require a Power Supply, can be used on  
both Mac OSX and Windows XP/Vista, And the Flash Drive is more  
durable. I once accidentally left a USB Flash Drive in my jeans and  
it went through the Wash. After a few days drying it was back in  
action with no data loss.

Two days ago at Walmart of all places I saw 2GB SanDisk USB2 Cruzer  
Flash Drive for $18. I bought three!

So, Back up everything on your Zip Disks to a couple CD's or one DVD.  
Then yank out that Zip Drive and make use of that bay for a HD.

Good Luck no matter what you do,

</I>&gt;<i> Luke:

</I>&gt;<i> Before your post I had not considered that I could leave the Zip  
</I>&gt;<i> drive in place, and simply move it's power connection to an  
</I>&gt;<i> additional hard drive.  That way I won't need to upgrade the power  
</I>&gt;<i> supply, and I can fit 5 hard drives in the machine.  I never use  
</I>&gt;<i> the Zip drive, but would want it available just in case.  Shutting  
</I>&gt;<i> down the machine, switching the power back to the Zip drive, and  
</I>&gt;<i> then powering back up, just to use the Zip drive, would not be too  
</I>&gt;<i> much of a hassle considering I barely use the Zip drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As to the ATX power supply, the adjustments are merely soldering 2  
</I>&gt;<i> wires, which I think I could do.  I reviewed the post at  
</I>&gt;<i> xlr8yourmac, and I think I can do it.  My question is really then,  
</I>&gt;<i> do I need to put another fan in the machine, and if so, where?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As to the &quot;hackintosh&quot;, I actually bought (and have now sold) some  
</I>&gt;<i> components to start putting the entire G4 into a generic case, but  
</I>&gt;<i> then balked at the price.  If I can stuff five of the hard drives I  
</I>&gt;<i> have into the existing case for the cost of a $70 card and a $30  
</I>&gt;<i> dual drive bracket (and not need to upgrade the power supply), and  
</I>&gt;<i> then can do the same with another old G4 for the cost of another  
</I>&gt;<i> $70 card and a $30 dual drive bracket, I think that will be the way  
</I>&gt;<i> to go for me.
