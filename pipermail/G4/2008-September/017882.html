<PRE>Hello, Lars...
What have you done to restart the Quicksilver? You may have tried this, but
I would suggest unplugging your machine and letting it sit for at least 10
minutes. Be careful not to jostle the machine. Plug it back in and try the
normal start up by pushing in the start button. If that doesn't work, try
holding in the start button in for a full minute or until it starts. This
has worked for me in the past.

Subject: [G4] Was Sonnet G4 upgrade now Quicksilver breakdown

Thanks a lot for two positiv answers. I hadn&#180;t realized that the update was
to be found in the firmware. I think that there is no need for an update.
Especially not in this very moment because my Q cannot boot at all now.
There was a short break in the electric net (which very seldom happens here
in Sweden) just when the Q was sleeping and now it cannot be rebooted. Where
is the prince with a warming kiss? Any idea?
