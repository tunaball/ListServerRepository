<PRE>I recall when my MDD &quot;windtunnel&quot; was new, there was a German  
company, Verax I believe, who had a kit to fix heating and cooling  
problems that are common in most MDD G4 computers. One of the kits  
was a new CPU/Case fan that spun at a different RPM that drew less  
power and another kit was a new Copper Heatsink with twin mini CPU  
fans instead of a bulky large fin Aluminum Heatsink that is common in  
most G4 Towers. I know Verax makes other cooling systems for many  
other computers.

Personally I try not to overtax my Power supply as my machine is  
pushing 5 years old and I do not have the money to keep up with the  
latest and greatest. I just cannot understand why people think that  
you must have half a dozen HD's in your Mac at once. With Large HD's  
abound its easy to have 1 or 2 HD's in any G4 Tower with capacities  
in the 250GB to 1TB range. Especially with Serial ATA PCI cards being  
rather economical, the Power draw from a Serial Power connector is  
less than of the traditional Parallel ATA ands the Cabling is thinner  
and smaller thus allowing for better Air flow.

Peace,

Luke R.
