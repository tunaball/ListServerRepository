<PRE>Yo fellow G4ers!

I am still using my old 400mhz Sawtooth and it just keeps on rocking. I have
done few upgrades to it other than a USB2 Belkin card and a couple of larger
hard drives. Lately I also added a cheap LaCie external hard drive.

I use it now to surf the Internet and email and for writing text.

I now use Ubuntu on a couple of recent Dual Core PCs. They are fast and
Ubuntu is becoming a remarkable tool and much easier to use than it was
originally.

Nevertheless I still fall back to my Sawtooth 9 times out of 10.

I soon intend to upgrade to a faster tower but I intend to get a later model
Mac Pro. Nothing new, as I don't find it makes sense when you can get a very
fast PC for video editing purposes for a lot less money. And if you use the
PC for a limited number of specific purposes, off of any type of Internet or
network, they do their job quite well.

I only wish Apple would offer a lower price tower, as I use a variety of
add-on cards for professional purposes.

Today for example, I was called by a friend who wanted to buy an older
LeafScan scanner that uses a Mac SCSI card. My friend wanted to know if he
could attach it to his 20 inch iMac. After doing some research I felt it
would be easier for him to buy an old G4 with a used SCSI card. So he is now
on the lookout for a used Mac G4 of some sort.

IOW, these old machines still offer a lot of use.

I am glad that there are still a few of you &quot;hangers on&quot; still around!

Bill
Montreal
