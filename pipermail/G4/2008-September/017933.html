<PRE>This list is great!  Thanks everyone!

Mike:

Thank you for the additional information.  Before I read your most  
recent post, I chickened out and used Intech's Hi-Capacity Extension,  
but may end up doing the firmware adjustment in the future, because  
the firmware adjustment is not something that needs to load with each  
system boot.

Does this firmware adjustment work for OS 9 also?

johnnyg:

I had given some thought about snaking cables out of the computer  
chassis, but your comments brought some issues to mind that I had not  
considered.  I'm hoping to keep these drives in the machine, but may  
need to at least put the power supplies out of the machine if the  
power supply issue is too daunting.

Luke:

Before your post I had not considered that I could leave the Zip drive  
in place, and simply move it's power connection to an additional hard  
drive.  That way I won't need to upgrade the power supply, and I can  
fit 5 hard drives in the machine.  I never use the Zip drive, but  
would want it available just in case.  Shutting down the machine,  
switching the power back to the Zip drive, and then powering back up,  
just to use the Zip drive, would not be too much of a hassle  
considering I barely use the Zip drive.

As to the ATX power supply, the adjustments are merely soldering 2  
wires, which I think I could do.  I reviewed the post at xlr8yourmac,  
and I think I can do it.  My question is really then, do I need to put  
another fan in the machine, and if so, where?

As to the &quot;hackintosh&quot;, I actually bought (and have now sold) some  
components to start putting the entire G4 into a generic case, but  
then balked at the price.  If I can stuff five of the hard drives I  
have into the existing case for the cost of a $70 card and a $30 dual  
drive bracket (and not need to upgrade the power supply), and then can  
do the same with another old G4 for the cost of another $70 card and a  
$30 dual drive bracket, I think that will be the way to go for me.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I implemented it on my own G4 DA fairly easily. Once you

</I>&gt;<i> the system recognizes the additional capacity on the HD,
</I>&gt;<i> and so far has read and written to it without difficulty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did arrange partitions on the new drive to put OS9 on
</I>&gt;<i> the first partition, and simply open space on the second
</I>&gt;<i> and third, if that makes any difference for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anything goes wrong, you can reset the system to its
