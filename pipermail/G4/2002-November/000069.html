<PRE>Please join us for our &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; meeting with the BOSFCPUG on Tuesday,
November 26, 2002, from 7pm - 9:30pm, at the College of Communications in
Comm 101 Hall at Boston University. Doors OPEN at 6:30pm! As always, our
meetings are FREE and open to the public, and we will be asking for a $5
donation from those who would like to participate in the BIG DIG RAFFLE. In
addition, we will ask for a $1 donation to participate in the Thanksgiving
Turkey Raffle with proceeds to go to The Mirror Project.

You can REGISTER now at: <A HREF="http://seminars.apple.com/goToEvent.html?id=20230.">http://seminars.apple.com/goToEvent.html?id=20230.</A>

Theme of our meeting will be ALL ABOUT QUICKTIME 6 for OS X and to add
Thanksgiving flavor to our meeting, in addition to our Big Dig Raffle, we'll
be raffling off a Thanksgiving turkey from Bread and Circus, with proceeds
to go to THE MIRROR PROJECT, a nonprofit DV filmmaking collaborative headed
by Somerville, MA media educator and documentary filmmaker Roberto Ar&#233;valo
(<A HREF="http://www.mirrorproject.org">http://www.mirrorproject.org</A>).

Meeting Agenda:
- BOSFCPUG Team member Steve Garfield will talk about using QuickTime in
cause-related media by showing us his coverage of the recent Boston Common
Anti-War Rally. Steve, an emerging FCP user, will talk about what he has
learned with FCP in putting this piece together and exporting it to
QuickTime for IndyMedia.org.

- Sean Sanders of CustomFlix will talk all about CustomFlix's DVD Publishing
&amp; Fulfillment service, designed to simplify the DVD production and
distribution process. Sean will discuss how CustomFlix will manage your
project based upon your content submission by providing: A high-quality
transfer to DVD, creation of a customized e-store, transaction processing,
on-demand duplication of DVDs and VHS tapes, packaging, and shipping the
final product to your customer. Sean will touch upon how CustomFlix acts as
your silent partner, making it easy and profitable to get videos into the
hands of your customers.

- QuickTime Creator Ravi Jain will talk about using text descriptors with
QuickTime 6 for OS X for such interesting uses as for captioning and for
triggering frames and windows of additional video and media content in your
browser for telling your stories. Ravi will also talk about his QuickTime
based work at WGBH Boston and his most recent work on the season premiere of
&quot;American Experience&quot; featuring the life of Jimmy Carter. For more info,
visit <A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/.</A>

- We will also have our regular INTERMISSION, an excellent NETWORKING
opportunity for BOSFCPUG members to introduce yourselves to each other and
to interact with our presenters and filmmakers.

- Our FEATURED guest, Denis Flynn of Discreet, Inc., will give us an
overview of CLEANER 6 for OS X and discuss the many ways in which to improve
QuickTime compression with CLEANER 6 and how it compliments Final Cut Pro as
a QuickTime Encoding tool. Denis will also answer member questions on using
CLEANER 6 to encode MPEG 2 content from video exported from Final Cut Pro.

- Time permitting, we will also have the highly popular STUMP THE FCP GURUS,
where we ask YOU to bring your burning FCP, QuickTime and DVD questions to
the meeting and get them answered by FCP gurus from BOSFCPUG. Always a hit
and a great way to learn new tips and tricks in editing with Final Cut Pro.
Participants will include Jeff Warmouth and Charles Roberts of Fitchburg
State College, Loren &quot;KeyGuide&quot; Miller, Ravi Jain, Daniel Berube, and other
FCP users. 

MARK DOWN Tuesday, November 26 in your calendars and come join us! REGISTER
