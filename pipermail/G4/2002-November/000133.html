<PRE>This posting to the G4-List is to post an open  'Thank You' to Mike Bombich
for Carbon Copy Cloner. It saved my six - again!

<A HREF="http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html">http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html</A>

I have two hard drives in this G4 powered by OSX. One is my primary and the
other is a secondary or backup drive.  Every few days I use Carbon Copy
Cloner to clone the primary to secondary.

Last night I was messing with iPhoto to export a large number of pictures to
html file and like the old bumper sticker says &quot;Shit Happens&quot; and my whole
iPhoto library was gone along with all email files and God only knows what
else disappeared. I have no idea what happened or why but my 'good stuff'
was history and could not be found on the drive.

I did a restart from the backup drive and everything was okay from two days
before.  I ran the OSX 10.2.2 Disk Utility and the First Aid said there was
nothing wrong with the primary hard drive; however, it had 5MB less data
than the backup drive with less folders and files.  I manually move a few
new downloads and files from the primary to the secondary and let the Disk
Utility do an Erase and ran First Aid agin.  I then ran CCC to clone the
backup to the primary and did a restart on the primary.

Humpty-Dumpty is back together again thanks to Carbon Copy Cloner that gets
my vote for the 'must have' application of the year.  If you do not have a
backup drive, get one and send a donation to Mike-B.
