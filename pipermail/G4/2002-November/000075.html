<PRE>Check the monitor; you didn't say if you took it to the store.  Did the store 
plug the keyboard and mouse into the same USB port you normally use (the 
temporaty relief suggests a possible USB problem)?  It's a very long shot, but 
power is another one of the things that may be different between your house and 
the store.  I've seen a printer not work when plugged into a perfectly fine 
outlet strip, but changing the outlet strip &quot;fixed&quot; it (everything else on the 
strip, computer, terminal, lamp, worked fine).  The point is, try changing 
everything including your socks.

And &quot;It works fine here&quot; seems to happen a lot at CompUSA, try somewhere else if 
all else fails.

</I>&gt;<i> couple of times...none of this helped.

</I>&gt;<i> I took the computer in for servicing (CompUSA) and they said they

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I try to restart my computer using the Mac OS CD, but the computer
</I>&gt;<i> ignores my keystrokes (holding down the C).  I also tried to restart and
</I>&gt;<i> rebuild the desktop (apple key + option key) and those keyboard commands
</I>&gt;<i> were ignored.  This made me think the problem had something to do with
</I>&gt;<i> my keyboard and/or mouse so I replaced them with an Macally iKey
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard and a Kensington Studio Mouse (optical). I thought the new
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard &amp; mouse fixed my problems because I didn't have anymore
</I>&gt;<i> crashes.  After a couple months of using the new keyboard &amp; mouse my
</I>&gt;<i> computer crashed and I had the same old problem again.  I'm pretty sure
</I>&gt;<i> there's a problem with the computer recognizing the keyboard and/or
</I>&gt;<i> mouse because the light on my optical mouse doesn't come on after the
</I>&gt;<i> extensions and everything else is finished loading.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone know what could be happening with my computer, and how can I
</I>&gt;<i> fix the problem? I hope I'm being clear on describing my problem and
</I>&gt;<i> sorry for the long post. Thanks for any help you can give me.
