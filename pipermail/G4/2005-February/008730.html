<PRE>Same exact issues.
I had one tech tell me I needed Outlook express to use the news 
servers. He said OE for OS X was the best.
I informed them that MS does not make OE for X, but Entourage. He was 
dumbfounded.
After a few weeks, I also noticed that my connect speed was down around 
500-800 kbps.
They were never able to resolve it.
I switched to Comcast, I am getting 4MB, and they support Mac's No 
problems.
Bell allowed me to cancel my 1 year contract/commitment  without any 
problems.
Apparently they realize their support is a bit lacking.
I do know one friend who uses Bellsouth, and seems very happy with it.
Anyway, as Dennis would say, That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.

</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> didn't seem to have much of a clue as to how to resolve a problem

</I>&gt;<i> ago.  I
</I>&gt;<i> had switched over to all Macs by 2002 and I got their DSL Extreme.
</I>&gt;<i> Everything was working fine for about 2 weeks.....I had the Westell

</I>&gt;<i> when one day service 'seemed' to be down.  I called up tech support 
</I>&gt;<i> and was

</I>&gt;<i> had
</I>&gt;<i> me disconnecting things all over the house....he even insisted that I 
</I>&gt;<i> needed
</I>&gt;<i> to disconnect my house alarm.  Still nothing worked to restore service 
</I>&gt;<i> even
</I>&gt;<i> though the modem showed all green.  Finally he said a tech person 
</I>&gt;<i> would call
</I>&gt;<i> me back.
</I>&gt;<i> I got my call back and the tech told me to try connecting using 
</I>&gt;<i> Internet
</I>&gt;<i> Explorer.  I didn't have it installed and he said that he didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> believe me.
</I>&gt;<i> I told him that I was using a Mac and he said THAT was the real 
</I>&gt;<i> problem as
</I>&gt;<i> OS X was flawed and not supported by them.  When I told him that their 
</I>&gt;<i> web
</I>&gt;<i> site didn't say anything about that, all he could say was to download
</I>&gt;<i> Internet Explorer via dialup and then call him back.
</I>&gt;<i> I did this and loaded it up.....called him back and guess what, 
</I>&gt;<i> Internet
</I>&gt;<i> Explorer connected to the web....Safari and Apple Mail still wouldn't.
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, he says that the fault is in OS X and the Macintosh....I 
</I>&gt;<i> told
</I>&gt;<i> him that I didn't believe him.  I even called Apple Tech support and 
</I>&gt;<i> asked
</I>&gt;<i> them if they had ever been presented with such an issue....they said 
</I>&gt;<i> no.
</I>&gt;<i> Called BellSouth tech guy back and told him what Apple had said.  His
</I>&gt;<i> response was that to use BellSouth DSL, I would have to use Internet
</I>&gt;<i> Explorer and for mail I'd have to load OS 9 and run Outlook Express.  
</I>&gt;<i> I told
</I>&gt;<i> him that this was completely ridiculous as I had had DSL previously and
</I>&gt;<i> everything worked them and since re-establishing service 2 weeks prior,
</I>&gt;<i> everything had been working fine.  He had no answer for this and just 
</I>&gt;<i> stuck
</I>&gt;<i> with his 'suggestion'.  I said 'fine, just cancel service'.  I called
</I>&gt;<i> Adelphia cable back and got installation scheduled for the next day.
</I>&gt;<i> The following morning, I attempted to connect via BellSouth (not
</I>&gt;<i> disconnected yet) using Safari and guess what?  Everything worked 
</I>&gt;<i> fine.  So
</I>&gt;<i> did Apple Mail!
</I>&gt;<i> After that stupidity, I'll NEVER go back to BellSouth!  Their support 
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> horrible for the Mac user....and even still sucks when you use a PC.  
</I>&gt;<i> With
</I>&gt;<i> Adelphia, I've NEVER had a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the length of this post and that it is WAY off topic, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to let you know of my experience with them as a Mac user.
