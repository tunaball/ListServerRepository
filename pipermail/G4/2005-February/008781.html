</I>&gt;<i> Has this happened to anyone else? I figure I am looking at a new PS.

</I>The computer works well with the firewire drive but now it has started 
to not read CD's. CDRs, commercial disks, nuttin. Another question I 
have is, would using a third party IDE Controller in place of the built 
in controller function.  This problem seems to be centered around the 
on board IDE controller.   Any thoughts.
