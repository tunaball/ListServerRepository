I too got dropped, apparently due to excessive &quot;bounces&quot;.

I discussed this with my ISP - concerned about why and how email
addressed to me might get bounced (not good for business!).

Here is their explanation, lightly edited:

 &gt; The reason that mail from the list is bouncing is because it's being
 &gt; sent from a mailserver that has no reverse DNS lookup.
 &gt;
 &gt; The problem occurs iff the list server XXXXXX.org resolves to
 &gt; aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd, but aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd does not resolve back to
 &gt; XXXXXX.org.  Officially, every mail server on the Internet is supposed
 &gt; to resolve in both directions.  It verifies that the incoming mail is
 &gt; really coming from the source that it reports to be. Spammers, who don't
 &gt; want to be known, usually send out spam via servers that do not resolve
 &gt; one way or the other, and so we will block emails from these servers.
 &gt;
 &gt; We do relax that rule from time to time, when the mail traffic is low.
 &gt; These days there is an increasing need to leave the filters on, and my
 &gt; personal belief is that eventually the filters will be left on
 &gt; permanently.
 &gt;
 &gt; So what to do from here? Let the owners of the mailing list know that
 &gt; we, like many other ISP's including AOL, will not accept mail from mail
 &gt; servers that do not have a reverse DNS entry.

Hope this helps...
