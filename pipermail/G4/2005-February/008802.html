I believe it.  I just moved over a few months ago, and my wife is still 
using Classic for some applications which we have not replaced in OS X 
yet.

That is OK.

That is OK too.

Ah....  That is a different question.  The answer is as much as you can 
spare.

I have a QuickSilver G4 733.  It has two internal 40GB hard dries.  
During the years that we ran OS 9 and had an early version of OS X that 
was practically useless, I had seven or eight partitions.  I was ready 
to use the same scheme when I bought and installed 10.3 Panther, but 
folks on the X-Newbies list convinced me to simplify things.  I'm glad 
I did.

Now I have one hard drive with one partition.  This is the Main Drive 
for all work and play.  It normally boots to OS X.  It runs Classic in 
excellent form.  And it can boot to OS 9 if I want, but I cannot 
remember the last time or why.  The OS X is set up with four accounts, 
including one for the Grandkids with limited permissions where they 
cannot hurt anything in the other accounts.

On the other hard drive, I have three partitions.  One is 30 GB for OS 
9.2.2 and includes all the old applications and all the data as of the 
date I started using the Main Drive.  Things went so well on the Main 
Drive that I started up here maybe two or three times at the beginning 
just to compare things.  This partition is now useless, so I'll begin 
using it for backing up the Main Drive.  The other two partitions are 
for OS X Emergency/test (5.8 GB) and for Photoshop Scratch space  (2.5 
GB).
