If you can do it on the desktop then you should be able to do it into a  
folder.
  Are you opening a file or is the APP opening automatically on startup?

Well that is not what &quot;save as&quot; is for. Save as  comes into play when  
you are experimenting or making a new file from a template or using a  
NEW FILE NAME (even just a 1 letter change)  for backup purposes or if  
you are saving it as a different format  or putting it in some other  
place.
Assuming you opened a file from a nested folder or the APP opened it  
automatically there should be no impediment to doing a SAVE and  
updating your file.
Save as  is going to go to the same place unless you change it.  If you  
are not changing the name or location of your file but simply updating  
it , Save as,  is  the wrong thing.

Assuming that you have opened a file worked on it and then use &quot;Save&quot;  
it should just work.
Maybe  MAYBE you are not actually working on the file you think you are.

Maybe you need to &quot;fix permissions&quot; or verify your disc.
