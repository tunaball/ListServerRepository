Ahh...  Now that someone on this list explained to me what a &quot;nested 
folder&quot; is, maybe I can add something to this discussion.

Could it be, just maybe, that Richard's question and the answer 
suggested by Ron's &quot;use the dialogue window functions&quot; both relate to 
that little square button in the window which allows the default to be 
a little bitty window that seems ridiculous and very difficult to use.  
In my first month with OS X, I found it absolutely frustrating to use.  
Then, maybe by accident, I found that hitting the button turned the 
triangle upside down and opened the wonderfully useful and large window 
where you see your files and folders in either column view or list 
view.  Much Better!

proactive self-defense is for the rest of us.
