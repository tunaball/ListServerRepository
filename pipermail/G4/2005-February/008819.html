<PRE>Jim:

Several months ago, I quit the digest mode for this list and the others 
that have the &quot;.themacintoshguy.com&quot; server address.  That is because 
the digests stopped coming out daily, even if there was only one item 
for the day.  It seemed the digests would collect items over a period 
of days until some numerical threshold came about, and some of the 
items were therefore many days old before I saw them.

OK, for the lowendmac and other e-lists where I still enjoy the digest 
mode, there are three things to accomplish.  Depending on the specific 
mail client that I use, today OS X Mail, and several months ago, 
Outlook Express, the specific button pushing and procedure is 
different.  With Mail, the process is a bit more clumsy than with 
Outlook Express.

Highlight only the individual message to which you reply.  Then hit the 
Reply button.

Ensure that your &quot;From&quot; address is the same as the address you used to 
subscribe to the list.  If you have more than one e-mail account, a 
different account name may appear in your From line.

Change the Subject line that results from your highlighting action to 
read something different than the title of the list.  Usually, I just 
copy and paste the specific subject of the poster's message.  If the 
subject is changing within the thread, it is usually appropriate to 
insert a new subject title, ending the new title with the old subject 
in parentheses.

And, like I am doing in this reply, you have the option of putting the 
poster's e-mail address in the Cc: line to ensure that the person 
receives your reply quicker than waiting for the digest.

In OS X Mail, the problem with this process is that when I hit Reply, 
the incoming digest message window disappears.  So, when I want to 
continue reading the digest, I have to go back to the Inbox to reopen 
it.  Or, if I want to adjust my treatment of my reply text by getting 
something that I had deleted, I have to reopen the digest.

Hope this helps, try it.
