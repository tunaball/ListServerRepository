<PRE>I ran into a basic Mac (Course #101) problem this weekend and could use some
help.  I was making changes to a document and used the Save several times.
To be sure everything was really saved I even did a Save As (several times)
and the application came up with the standard box asked to let me know the
filename would be replaced.  To make a long shaggy-dog story shorter, the
document was not changed and the Get Info showed the old mod date with
normal read/write permission.  There was no new document in the nested
folder and I check the whole hard drive looking for files with the same .xml
extension.

I then copied the document to the new folder on the desktop and and did the
same test. This time the document's mod date was updated to 'Today' and the
document was revised.

Can someone tell me why I cannot get documents to save in a nested folder?
I can repeat the failure and this is disturbing in that the application
(that I would rather not name) says it is updated the file but it is not
being changed.

Dick
