<PRE>I have a Quick Silver '02  dual 1gig, currently at 867 due to a dead 
processor. I recently had some issues with the drives not spinning up. 
My constant on/off/pram resets pretty much finished the logic board as 
well. First I sent the PS to a Mac repairer for the &quot;free&quot; diagnoses. I 
was told the PS was fine so then I sent in the logic board and after 
calling them they said the board was dead and it couldn't be repaired. 
OK so of course they could replace the board so I did that. A few days 
later I reassembled my QS and it booted and ran fine, much to my 
relief. After about 5-6 hrs the drives again spun down. Being careful 
only to do ONE pram reset I proceeded to change cables, change drives, 
try one at a time. nothing worked. All those drives spun up fine in my 
one firewire enclosure. A check of the voltages at the plugs showed 
4.75v and 9.6v respectively. I tried this with drives connected and 
disconnected. Curiously enough my internal CDRW runs fine while my hard 
drives will not spin at all when connected to the PS. Although they 
work fine in the Firewire. I own a lot of Macs starting with a Color 
Classic II and had no problems like this occur. This is my first G4 and 
all this trouble is driving me back towards a PC.   Oh I also checked 
the battery and it was at 1.2v so it got replaced first thing. Has this 
happened to anyone else? I figure I am looking at a new PS. Or could 
the new board have failed like the original? Your thoughts will be 
greatly appreciated

Joel
