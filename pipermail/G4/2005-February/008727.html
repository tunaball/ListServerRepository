I had a bad experience w/ Verizon DSL, which ran at roughly 64k and 
needed a small
bit of software that Mac programs couldn't deal with.(see through)
Their support was similarly PCcentric.
I am sour on DSL and love my optimum cable.

Regarding the choices for DSL service, I subscribed to SBC DSL service 
early last year, specifically because their literature said that they 
supported wireless DSL for Mac computers.

I received a 2Wire Modem, the software, and all the phone-line filters 
that I needed for my house phones for $99.95 with a $99.00 rebate on my 
first month's bill. Their tech walked me through the entire 
installation and configuration procedure and had me on the line within 
30 minutes with: 1) my G4 Gbit Ethernet, 2) my wife's Rev 1 iMac with 
Airport card adapter installed, 3) my Pismo laptop, and 4) my Lombard 
laptop.

SBC has always provided timely tech support for me and even helped me 
to install their service for a teacher friend and do the upgrade 
configuration for my own machines when needed. Whenever I need tech 
information or support, I call in and ask for a Mac Tech and get all 
the help I need. I have only complimentary comments regarding the 
service I have received from SBC DSL.

I do have to state that your house or office HAS TO BE WITHIN a certain 
linear distance from the nearest telephone hub for you to receive 
service from SBC, but that has been the only limitation that I have 
encountered so far.
