<PRE>Thank you all again for your great help.&#160; I'll just update and see if anyone has any more suggestions.

Eric
asked if the computer becomes non-responsive in any other OS
installations.&#160; I am not positive whether it happens when I am running
10.4.11 on the back-up hd, but at a minimum it happens much less often.
I can try running it on that drive for a few days and see if it happens
at all.&#160; He referred to a discussion that seemed to point the finger at
a bad stick of RAM.&#160; I do always have the video playing problem and the
Java games problem in 10.4.11.

Rich suggested it seemed to be a
problem between Flash and the browser (I use both Firefox and Safari,
and I'm not that crazy about either one).&#160; I uninstalled and
reinstalled Flash and also tried installing Opera,&#160; No improvement.

Harry
was a huge and patient help in getting TechTools Deluxe on this
computer.&#160; I ran all the tests, including surface scan, on both
partitions of both hds and everything passed.&#160; These tests include a
RAM test, so I'm not sure if I would still need to play around with
removing a stick of RAM at a time, to see if there are any bad sticks,
or if the test would be sufficient.

A couple of you have made the suggestion that I might want to sell this G4 and buy a mac mini
or a G5.&#160; I might get to that point, but hope I don't have to.&#160; For one
thing, I'd find it pretty hard to sell this one when it's having
problems, and for another this has been a labor of love and I'm pretty
attached to it.

So, at this point I don't know what to do.&#160; At
least I've been able to eliminate some of the possibilities with your
generous help, and in the process picked up TechTools Deluxe, Stuffit Expander and Opera.

Thanks,
Andrea


  &#160;  &#160;
