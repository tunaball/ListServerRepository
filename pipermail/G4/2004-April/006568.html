     I don't really know how virtual memory allocation works on OS X. 
You can, however, take a look (in the Terminal, for instance, using 
&quot;top&quot; --- check the fifth line of the display, where it says &quot;VM&quot; and 
see [1] how much VM the system is using _while you're editing_ and 
[2] the rate at which the number of pageouts is increasing) . In any 
case. my son's old iBook with a 15 Gbyte drive started grinding to a 
halt (and munging permissions regularly) when it got down to ~ 3.5 
Gbyte of free space. I ended up getting him an external drive for his 
iTunes Music folder. Things work a lot better now.

     My suspicion is that iMovie, like image editing apps, uses a ton 
of VM, and you just don't have enough. Disk drives are so cheap that 
it's worth getting a large drive just for the peace of mind: no file 
system trashing when disk space is low, no VM space problems. I've 
had no problem running iMovie 2 and 3 on a variety of G4's, including 
500 AGP's, dual 500 Gbit Ethernets,  Quicksilvers, Cubes, and MDD's.

     YMMV,
