Excel 98 is not that old. It will surely do anything AppleWorks will do and there isn't much new in Excel 2001 for Mac. The changes allow a bunch of web-based things and they change the function of the command key, but there is little or no new arithmetic.

&gt;<i>Is there any way to keep my formulas?
</I>
Try using preferences to display formulas in Excel before copying the contents of a worksheet. The copy to the clipboard will contain the text for formulas starting with an = sign. They will paste into an AppleWorks sheet that way, but  AppleWorks may well not recognize anything but the simplest formulas. It just doesn't have all of Excel's function library available.

&gt;<i> Would a newer version of Appleworks keep formulas?
</I>
It's not AppleWorks that's dropping the formulas. It's Excel when you export the file. There was a format SYLK which is still partially supported by Excel but I'm not sure about AppleWorks.

&gt;<i>Other tack: buy a newer copy of Excel.
</I>
I'd have a look at Open Office or Gnumeric in the free software world before I did that. In principle they can be run on OS neXt but Linux runs fine on a $10.00  Intel discard. They also claim to import binary Excel files.

Applescript syntax is like English spelling:
Roughly, but not thoroughly, thought through.
