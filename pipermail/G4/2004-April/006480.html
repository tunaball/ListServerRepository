<PRE>Before you reinstall netscape be sure and check to make sure that the 
problems that you are having are not as a result of corrupt preferences 
or user profiles... If the problems are from corrupt preferences--- etc 
  you can reinstall all you want and it will not solve a thing until 
those problem causing files are removed.

help suggestions for Netscape 7.02

  Look in your documents folder for a folder named &quot;mozilla&quot;. Move it to 
the trash or desktop. Note that within this folder are files for your 
netscape user profile and bookmarks so don't delete them until you grab 
the stuff that you need out of them........


Also move to trash or relocate some netscape related files from your 
system folder / preferences.
Ex. Remove / relocate  stuff like this:  Netscape Users, Netscape, 
Netscape Registry......

Then start up Netscape and see if things are working any better....


Also you noted that your e-mails are important so copy you original 
Mail folder from your old profile to your new profile..... Locate it 
and replace it as you found it....
