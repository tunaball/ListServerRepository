<PRE>I hope that was a PCI video card and not an AGP.  There is only one AGP 
slot in a G4 as far as I know.

If you have a second computer network the two via ethernet and a router 
and log into your sick computer with the other via the GO menu.  Just 
get the bad one selected and log in with whatever your user and pass 
are on the broken one.  If you can see the disk you can save your data 
and muck with the system from afar.  If its just your video you will 
reach and log in, but if it's really gone you will not be able to log 
in at all.

</I>&gt;<i> Well, I thought I would trick the G4.  I put the original ATI Rage Pro

</I>&gt;<i> would be legible.  My reasoning was that then I could boot to my 
</I>&gt;<i> Panther
</I>&gt;<i> drive and install 10.3.3 which theoretically installs the correct 
</I>&gt;<i> driver for
</I>&gt;<i> the ATI Xclaim 3D Plus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I have totally lost the Panther drive!!!!  Yuck!!
</I>&gt;<i> I have used DiskWarrior, TechTool Pro 3, Norton 6, SCSIProbe 5.2 and 
</I>&gt;<i> Disk
</I>&gt;<i> Firstaid from the OS9 install disk.  None of them can even SEE the 
</I>&gt;<i> disk!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its as if I had disconnected the cable to the drive, which I'm going to
</I>&gt;<i> check right now.  (I don't see how I could have accidentally done that 
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> you never know until you check.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do any of you know what mysteries are at work here??
</I>&gt;<i> xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [...] Panther worked fine on the ATI Rage Pro 128 (OEM).  When I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> switched
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to ATI Xclaim 3D Plus the display when I switch to the Panther drive 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> almost illegible, weird negative black and white pixelated as hell. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [...] I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can't upgrade Panther from the other drive and also can't from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with Panther on it since I can't see plainly enough with the display 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yucked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is a nice catch-22 indeed. I see only two solutions. First, take 
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> Panther drive to another Mac and do the upgrade there. Or, two, ask a 
</I>&gt;<i> friend
</I>&gt;<i> with the correct version of Panther to e-mail you the ATI Rage Pro 
</I>&gt;<i> kexts
</I>&gt;<i> (they should be in /System/Library/Extensions/), which you could copy 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> your Panther. I'm not sure how well this will work, but it's worth a 
</I>&gt;<i> try.
