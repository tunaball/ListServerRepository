<PRE>You are right! A friend of mine told me that he had &quot;lost&quot; DiskCopy 
when he upgraded to OS-X. I hadn't had need to use that program in 
months, so I went looking on my G4 for it.

He was right and you are right. It was still available, just hidden 
within another program. Apple had integrated it into a new location and 
my friend couldn't find it because it wasn't listed in the Utilities 
folder. The functions are still there, but you sometimes have to go on 
a hunt to find them.

How dare Apple mess with my mind!!! I'm getting too old for this 
fooling around. I think I'll go have a senior moment.

Thanks a mil Ralph!  That did it.  Is it just me, or are some of the 
(IMO) basic controls pretty well buried in OS X?
