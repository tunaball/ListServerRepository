Before buying a card -- whether from Adaptec or anyone else -- you 
should always double-check with the manufacturer to make sure it works 
with a Mac. If it doesn't say so specifically, it might -- or it might 
not.

That has not been my experience; in fact, I believe that, starting with 
v10.2.x, Adaptec drivers are bundled with the OS. Do a search for 
&quot;Adaptec&quot; on your boot drive, and you'll find the relevant .kexts.

I'd suggest thinking well and hard before going the SCSI route for a 
scanner. Unless there's a very good reason (e.g., an expensive 
professional scanner which can't be replaced at this point), in the end 
it's probably better to get a new scanner, which is going to be USB or 
FW at the higher end. It's not only the actual hardware, but the 
software required to use it.
