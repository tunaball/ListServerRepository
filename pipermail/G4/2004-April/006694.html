<PRE>Thanks John. Yes, that does help to give me a start.

I didn't see Seagate listed for my G4 in the xlr8yourmac site you gave me 
but I'll work with the vendor to try this out. The Seagate 160 seems to be 
the modern external drive that would suit my needs. The ones listed in 
xlr8yourmac are either internals or of an older vintage. (I note plenty of 
mounting problems in those stories.)

Any advice from others would be appreciated.

One question about OS source. I recently bought an eMac for a different 
location. I'm using the OS 9.2.2 and OS X discs that came with it for my G4 
reload experiments. Is there any problem expected in this cross platform 
use?

And just to get me up to speed, is Classic an alternative that one makes on 
the fly when in OS X?

Thanks again for the useful response.

Greg

&gt;<i>So, two questions. Is there some known solution to my G4 freeze ups in 
</I>&gt;<i>9.2.2 and can I use the Seagate (or something else) for an outboard OS X?
</I>
Greg -
	A year ago I was having 9.2.2 freeze ups quite frequently. I never did find 
the causes. I fairly sure it was caused by extension conflicts. But I had a 
gazillion extensions and lacked the patience required to complete the 
trouble shoot process. It was much easier just to restart and go get a cuppa 
coffee.
	My core apps Photoshop and Finale too were only available for OS 9. I 
finally got fed up with the lock-ups,  purchased a second disc drive and 
installed OS-X just to see what all the fuss was all about. (And besides 
some games were beginning to appear that wouldn't work in OS-9 :-) )
	The long and short of it is ALL my core apps work just fine in Classic 
mode. And I have never had a freeze up of any kind since I went to OS-X. The 
actual installation conversion took just minutes but it took ME about three 
months to be sure that I could handle everything I needed to in the new 
system.  I think I've last booted into OS 9.2.2 about 9 months ago. Now that 
I'm really comfortable with OS-X,  I do most of my work in X and run in 
Classic mode whenever I need to. Sure I'll be looking to upgrade my core 
apps when they get too old and doddery, but for now I quite happy with what 
I've got.

I encourage you to get that extra drive and try out OS-X. Keep the old drive 
for your 9.2.2 system till you feel you can get along with out it.

I'm pretty sure you can use the Seagate for an outboard drive as long as it 
will fit into the enclosure. Check out
<A HREF="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/">http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/</A>   There will be a lot of reports of different 
drives being used in your particular machine model.  I've found it to be a 
very useful resource.

HTH
John
