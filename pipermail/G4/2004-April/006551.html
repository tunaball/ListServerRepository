<PRE>Griffin Technologies' &lt;<A HREF="http://griffintechnology.com/">http://griffintechnology.com/</A> &gt;products are 
generally designed for the Mac environment, but many are ecumenical. 
I find their products to be well engineered and of high quality. I 
bought the PowerWave so that one of these days, if I ever can get 
around to it, I can record some old LP albums from my turntable into 
iTunes and even burn CDs from them.  But, it is disconcerting to try 
to listen to CDs and have the sound go all distorted and tinny.  I 
take the sound from the earphone jack of the PowerWave amplifier and 
run it into an amplified  speaker system (Yamaha YST-MS30) with dual 
inputs (my PC is also connected directly into the speaker system).

BTW, I also noticed the same tinny distortion when I downloaded 
digital movies from my camera into iMovie.  I thought that the whole 
production would be ruined, and only when I played the final DVD did 
I learn that the sound was perfect.  Must have been the PowerWave all 
along, and my not knowing that at the time.

Again, I wonder if the USB bus (v1.1) is being overloaded.
