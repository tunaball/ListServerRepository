There are two reasons I wanted to switch. One was to get all my 
programs into OSX soon, so at such point that Classic
goes away, I won't be stuck in the past. (Some have pointed out here 
that Classic isn't going away real soon, so this may
not actually be an issue.)

The other reason is the Excel was given to me by a friend without 
original disks, manuals etc. and the Help resource
doesn't even load. I'd like to go legit on all my stuff, I'd feel 
better. This is the only program that's not aboveboard. Even
more importantly, it won't copy itself any more so I can't use it on my 
laptop (something corrupted along the line).
It generates errors. Works on the desktop, but for how long? I'd hate 
to lose all my personal financial data. Yes, I do
printouts, but it would be a hassle to retype, reinput all those 
formulas.

Thanks for all the input - it's very helpful. I'm thinking I could buy 
a copy of Excel 98 on Ebay and use that instead
of my current pirate version. Don't really need Office.

Although Appleworks 5 isn't bad - my formulas are very simple after all.
