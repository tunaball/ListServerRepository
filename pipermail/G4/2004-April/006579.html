<PRE>The return ISP address gives the reason away. Many, many, many, and 
many more than you could count, SPAM messages originate from 
&quot;@hotmail.com&quot; addresses which have been spoofed by programs which 
generate false return email addresses.

Apple and MSN have put HotMail accounts on their alert lists and 
sometimes that status causes messages originating from legitimate 
hotmail users to be flagged as SPAM by the Apple Mail and MSN Mail 
programs despite any rules that are created by the receiving users. 
Being on the &quot;alert lists&quot; does not mean that the messages will all be 
identified as being SPAM, but that they are suspect simply for the 
reason of having that particular return ISP address.

Legitimate users get painted with the same tar brush and we all have to 
live with that condition until our governments get the idea that SPAM 
is truly an objectionable and despicable problem and provide 
appropriate punishment for the senders.

I've set up Apple Mail to take all mail that doesn't have a viable 
return address and put
it in Possible Spam.
-----------------
Below is a G4 mail that ended up there, but why? I have a rule that 
sends
any mail with <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/g4.html">G4 at lists.themacintoshguy.com</A> in the To: field go to the 
G4 mailbox.
But this ended up in the Spam box.
