&gt;<i> So, two questions. Is there some known solution to my G4 freeze ups in 
</I>&gt;<i> 9.2.2 and can I use the Seagate (or something else) for an outboard OS 
</I>&gt;<i> X?
</I>
Greg -
	A year ago I was having 9.2.2 freeze ups quite frequently. I never did 
find the causes. I fairly sure it was caused by extension conflicts. 
But I had a gazillion extensions and lacked the patience required to 
complete the trouble shoot process. It was much easier just to restart 
and go get a cuppa coffee.
	My core apps Photoshop and Finale too were only available for OS 9. I 
finally got fed up with the lock-ups,  purchased a second disc drive 
and installed OS-X just to see what all the fuss was all about. (And 
besides some games were beginning to appear that wouldn't work in OS-9 
:<i>-) )
</I>	The long and short of it is ALL my core apps work just fine in Classic 
mode. And I have never had a freeze up of any kind since I went to 
OS-X. The actual installation conversion took just minutes but it took 
ME about three months to be sure that I could handle everything I 
needed to in the new system.  I think I've last booted into OS 9.2.2 
about 9 months ago. Now that I'm really comfortable with OS-X,  I do 
most of my work in X and run in Classic mode whenever I need to. Sure 
I'll be looking to upgrade my core apps when they get too old and 
doddery, but for now I quite happy with what I've got.

I encourage you to get that extra drive and try out OS-X. Keep the old 
drive for your 9.2.2 system till you feel you can get along with out it.

I'm pretty sure you can use the Seagate for an outboard drive as long 
as it will fit into the enclosure. Check out
<A HREF="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/">http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/</A>   There will be a lot of reports of 
different drives being used in your particular machine model.  I've 
found it to be a very useful resource.

HTH
John
