A major cause of solder joint failure is thermal cycling. The variation in thermal expansion coefficient between the fiberglass board and the solder, or other large component, produces forces which can be much greater than stretched cables. It is a reason, sometimes given, for leaving computers on but I don't mean to imply that that is always a good idea. Just being hot is bad too.

Rich explicitly said he was competent. Don't you trust him?

As for the manual, if anyone knows how to get service data out of Apple we'd all like to know about it. If the computers weren't the only decent choice I would refuse to buy anything from Apple because of that attitude. Compare to an outfit like Tektronix.
