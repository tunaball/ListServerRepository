<PRE>I would like to forward something to the list about this subject that Jay
cannot post right now. Below is a copy of the emails that Jay and myself
have been going back and forth about regarding this subject.

It may not show up as such;  but if you go to System Prefs/Internet and
Network/Sharing and select the Internet pane, you can share your connection
from (a pull down menu - select built-in ethernet for DSL or cable modem),
and then click in the box below To computers using: Airport. This would push
the data streams to both en0 and en1, tho I am not sure which one gets which
data stream (but does it matter?).
are you at work, or at home?
I will be at work until around 5 - 202.781.1652 if you want to call.
Jay

boy you really got me on this one. I can't seem to assign en1 to airport.
en1 shows up in the Network utility but nothing else. I have to do some
searching on the board.

&gt;<i> Did you go thru the System Preferences to see what I talked about below?
</I>&gt;<i> ;o)
</I>&gt;<i> and no, we can't all know everything - that's why we have these lists to
</I>&gt;<i> help one another!

</I>&gt;<i> Jay this is so cool, guess you can't know everything. Wayne.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ----------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From: 	Snoke Jay S NSSC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wayne-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Check out the following:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System Preferences/Sharing (for moving files back and forth between two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; computers, and to share an internet connection - see the Services pane
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Internet Pane (I'm running the latest version of 10.3.3, so this may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vary on what version of the Mac OS you are using)); and,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System Preferences/Network.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can have one DSL/cable ethernet connected to one computer *and*
</I>&gt;<i> share
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; via two airport cards - one on the wired one, and one on the wireless
</I>&gt;<i> one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Keep in mind tho, the airport connection shares the available bandwidth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the wired ethernet connection to the cable/DSL.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Remember, all Unix systems have two ethernet connections (en0 and en1)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; running as part of the basic OS all the time.  you can assign the
</I>&gt;<i> airport
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one, and hard-wired ethernet to the other! :o)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I won't go into all the hairy details on how to do it - I know others on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list have already done so.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can post this if you like...I can't presently, but you know I would
</I>&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could. ;o)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My home network is part wired and part wireless.  All my laptops are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wireless via a basestation, and all my desktops are wired. My sharing is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; done via the basestation and a small hub/switch, as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cable modem to basestation to (wired hub and wireless);  wired hub to
</I>&gt;<i> two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; desktop Macs; basestation wireless to up to 4 Apple laptops...

&gt;<i> &gt; Jay your just a wealth of info. But to be honest, you got me on this
</I>&gt;<i> one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have delayed answering you so that I might search out this topic on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Apple's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; site. Do you you have any specifics on this? Would you like me to
</I>&gt;<i> forward
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your response to the group? Maybe I should have been a little more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definative in my response. Will this also work if you have a cable/dsl
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection or is this just to network 2 computers. Really interested,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wayne.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Wayne-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I can not reply to the list due to an email address change;  how's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; everything going?  We haven't conversed in a while.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have to take exception to what you say below - your statement is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; incorrect...  you *can* network airport card to airport card without
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; need for a basestation (and I know you know this!!! ;o)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; To network the two together, you just need two airport cards...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; cheers-
</I>	&gt; &gt; &gt; Jay
