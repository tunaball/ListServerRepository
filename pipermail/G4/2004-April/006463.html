I have a similar question with a couple of extras.  I've put 10.2.8 and 
9.2.2 on a Beige and a B&amp;W with no problems having installed 10.2 
first, combo updating to 10.2.8 then using an OS 9 disk and updating to 
9.2.2.  However I'm trying to do the same with an AGP G4 and am having 
trouble.  I've installed 10.2.8 then start up with an OS 9 disk but 
unlike the other Macs I've done this with, in the AGP OS 9 does not 
recognize the hard disk and wants to reinitialize.  I was thinking that 
I might try a 9.2 disk and maybe that will work but an AGP is supposed 
to work with 8.6.  Still, maybe it is because of the previously 
installed 10.2.8?  But it was installed on the Beige and B&amp;W too.  I 
could use some advice.

TIA,
        Anand
