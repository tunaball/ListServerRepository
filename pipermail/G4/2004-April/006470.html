actually, i WAS wrong... no specific number, but since os 9.1, apple 
has allowed &quot;more than 2 forks&quot;

&gt;&gt;<i> [...] in the same way hfs+ had big issues when it came on the scene 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for macs, but with its current state on 10.3, it even self-defrags 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files up to 25? KB.... much better than any other desktop option out 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, Panther does adaptive hot file clustering (cool!). But can you 
</I>&gt;<i> answer me this. Is HFS+, as implemented under Panther, the first 
</I>&gt;<i> desktop OS to do this type of clustering? Is its algorithm superior to 
</I>&gt;<i> other FSs which do adaptive clustering? And on what criteria did you 
</I>&gt;<i> decide HFS+ is better than, say, ext3 or ReiserFS?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
i was speaking desktop - basically windows and macintosh - consumer 
machines, which for the most part now all run HFS+, NTFS AND FAT32 - 
probably a few fat16 . i know very few (in fact none) consumer types 
who run linux.


&gt;<i> But this whole discussion is about a bogus issue, driven chiefly by 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;mine is bigger than yours&quot; syndrome. (Or perhaps not bogus, but 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly of interest chiefly to geeks who eat OS specs for 
</I>&gt;<i> breakfast.) It's not the file system that really counts, it's a 
</I>&gt;<i> combination of features, FS included.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
nah, its about trying to get the highest performance out of the 
machines we have without having to splurge for a brand spanking new 
machine. its also about trying to maintain a very useful knowledge 
about the working of software i use daily (and kind of like my '71 
motor scooter i commute on, i know enough to keep it running well, and 
more than enough to make me dangerous..


&gt;<i> So what if HFS+ is inferior to, say, ReiserFS (assuming there are 
</I>&gt;<i> truly objective criteria that would allow us to make such a 
</I>&gt;<i> determination). Would that mean Linux is a better choice for you than 
</I>&gt;<i> Mac OS X? Not every feature of Mac OS X is superior to comparable 
</I>&gt;<i> features on competitive platforms (Windows and Linux), and Mac OS X 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't a better choice in every circumstance or for every user. (Only a 
</I>&gt;<i> basic inner insecurity drives certain fellows to proclaim otherwise.) 
</I>&gt;<i> But it provides a combination of features which make it an excellent 
</I>&gt;<i> choice in many circumstance. It's the best OS for my needs (though, 
</I>&gt;<i> for instance, not for my wife's), and, presumably, for the needs of 
</I>&gt;<i> everybody else on this list -- so can we move on now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I take the liberty to suggest, for HFS+ details, Apple Tech Note 
</I>&gt;<i> TN1150, updated last month to include Panther implementation 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1150.html">http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1150.html</A>&gt;, and, for a 
</I>&gt;<i> balanced and intelligent perspective on OS X -- IMHO, of course -- 
</I>&gt;<i> Amit Singh's article &quot;What Is Mac OS X?&quot; at 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.kernelthread.com/mac/osx/">http://www.kernelthread.com/mac/osx/</A>&gt;. Try reading at least the 
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
read it previously and thought it great. im not arguing the application 
of the right product to the right job, simply pointing out what appear 
to be erroneous/misleading statements.

&gt;<i> f
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes, i got most of my information from one source, but trust software 
developers as big as intech to know what they are doing. i know nothing 
about software development besides what i garnered from 4 years of 
computer science and microelectronics engineering major college 
roommates... im simply an somewhat intuitive, though very spacey, 
artist who most likely was/will be a mechanical engineer in another 
life....
