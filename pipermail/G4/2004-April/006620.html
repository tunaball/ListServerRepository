<PRE>LOL with tears in my eyes.
Well, I thought I would trick the G4.  I put the original ATI Rage Pro 128 
(OEM) in another slot and connected my monitor to it instead so the display 
would be legible.  My reasoning was that then I could boot to my Panther 
drive and install 10.3.3 which theoretically installs the correct driver for 
the ATI Xclaim 3D Plus.

Now I have totally lost the Panther drive!!!!  Yuck!!
I have used DiskWarrior, TechTool Pro 3, Norton 6, SCSIProbe 5.2 and Disk 
Firstaid from the OS9 install disk.  None of them can even SEE the disk!

Its as if I had disconnected the cable to the drive, which I'm going to 
check right now.  (I don't see how I could have accidentally done that but 
you never know until you check.)

Do any of you know what mysteries are at work here??

&gt;<i>[...] Panther worked fine on the ATI Rage Pro 128 (OEM).  When I switched 
</I>&gt;<i>to ATI Xclaim 3D Plus the display when I switch to the Panther drive is 
</I>&gt;<i>almost illegible, weird negative black and white pixelated as hell. [...] I 
</I>&gt;<i>can't upgrade Panther from the other drive and also can't from the drive 
</I>&gt;<i>with Panther on it since I can't see plainly enough with the display yucked 
</I>&gt;<i>up.
</I>
That is a nice catch-22 indeed. I see only two solutions. First, take your 
Panther drive to another Mac and do the upgrade there. Or, two, ask a friend 
with the correct version of Panther to e-mail you the ATI Rage Pro kexts 
(they should be in /System/Library/Extensions/), which you could copy to 
your Panther. I'm not sure how well this will work, but it's worth a try.
