I'm sure it is and that they put nice drives in them. I use LaCie 
equipment. My monitor is a LaCie. It's a Mitsubishi.
  Nevertheless this thread up till now was focusing on thing like  speed 
capacity and memory buffers.
So we are talking raw drives. In every PC shop there are PILES of WD 
drives (busted), this is only partly accounted for by their popularity. 
Draw your own conclusions.
Maxtor has gotten an iffy and I have had quite a few Maxtors, some 
tough as nails and some that crapped out after two years as stated 
previously.
I have also had several IBM's and while fast they are quirky. Hitachi 
now.
However I have had now two scsi Seagate barracudas and three seagate 
Elite cinderblocks and two ATA Seagate barracudas. All used for video.
For speed , quietness, and reliabitlty I believe these to be the drives 
to buy considering that we are talking some pretty cheap money and 
expensive data.
You run out of space in your tower a LaCie case is definitely good. 
Stick another barracuda in it.
