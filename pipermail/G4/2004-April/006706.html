<PRE>Precisely the reasoning behind my post Alex, your rather blunt post that
&quot;it's probably not a good idea to use it&quot;
was a bit misleading, when in fact very few people have had reported 
trouble with file vault after the updates-though i readily admit there 
were quite serious problems with the 1st version. to this date, the 
only long lasting &quot;problem&quot; remains speed, and this is simply a fixture 
of on-the-fly encryption of data.

Just trying to shed the light of  first hand experience onto the shadow 
of anecdotal &quot;evidence&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> No reputable company like Apple is going to release a piece of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certain problems with File Vault have been reported widely. Does that 
</I>&gt;<i> mean _all_ users are affected? Absolutely not -- that would be a huge

</I>&gt;<i> no -- that would be a major story. What it means is that a minority of 
</I>&gt;<i> keener-than-average users have come across it, perhaps 20% or only 10% 
</I>&gt;<i> of the base. But the issue is, when you are handling important files 
</I>&gt;<i> (otherwise why encrypt them?) do you want to take the risk of being in 
</I>&gt;<i> the 20% or 10% who did have problems, or would you rather use a method 
</I>&gt;<i> which has a risk factor well below 1%?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is said that we learn from our own mistakes; the wise among us also 
</I>&gt;<i> learn from the mistakes of others.
