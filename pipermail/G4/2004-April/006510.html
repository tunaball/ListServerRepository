<PRE>Anne,
Appleworks 6 includes translators that will pick up the formulas in 
Excel. You don't even need to export the file. Start Appleworks and use 
the Open option and make sure you choose the proper file format at the 
bottom of the dialog. This should open all but the most complex 
spreadsheets with the formulas intact in Appleworks. You might loose 
some of the pretty formatting, though.

As far as Excel, 98 works well in Classic for me. I did pick up the 
Student and Teacher edition of Office v. X when Amazon had it for $100, 
as both my kids use it for homework. But as long as 98 still works for 
you, there's no pressing reason to spend a bunch of money if you don't 
mind Classic. Just make sure you have your computer backed up in case 
of corruption.
Mel
