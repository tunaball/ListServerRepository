Info here    <A HREF="http://www.cybercoment.com/macgeforce.htm">http://www.cybercoment.com/macgeforce.htm</A>

I flash on a Sawtooth. I perform the flashing operation &quot;blind&quot; meaning 
I don't have a monitor hooked up.

Download the Radeon8500Flasher.sit file near the bottom of the page. 
Boot into OS9 and set it to start with the base set of extensions. 
Place the Radeon 8500 Firmware RESTORE file in your startup items 
folder in OS9. Shut your computer down and place the ATI 8500 card in 
the AGP slot but DO NOT hook a monitor to it. Now start your computer 
and wait 10 minutes. Shut down and attach your monitor and start up 
again. Now you can DL the latest Radeon 8500 Firmware UPDATE directly 
from ATI and use it to update the card. You can also DL the latest 
drivers for OS9 and OS X from ATI too. It's worked flawlessly more than 
once but I only flash ATI cards, not the cards made with ATI chipsets 
by other manufacturers. And don't try it with a 128 MB card, only one 
person I know has successfully flashed one and it has problems from 
time to time.
