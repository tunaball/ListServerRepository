Thanks. This might work for me - I'd be willing to buy a copy of 6. 
What do you mean, pretty formatting?
I have kind of gotten used to color coding things in my budget in terms 
of giving cells a background color,
which separates headings and totals pretty well. 5 has font colors but 
I don't see background colors.
But I can live without this if I can get off the Microsoft-Go-Round. 
Otherwise, not much in the formatting line.

Trouble is, it would seem I can't copy Excel 98 back any more without 
it burping up an error code on
opening. I assume it has counted how many times it has copied or that 
it's a different computer. Original
computer was a 9500, then I copied it onto my present G4, as well as 
onto the G3 iBook, but it has
never worked on the G3. Remember that the original install was on a 
friend's computer, so I'm not
complaining here. (I do have Retrospect so if my Whole Drive Backup was 
done correctly that might
solve this problem.)

Any ideas, besides going straight and looking for a used copy of Excel 
98/Office on eBay? Could use
a manual too, because Workbooks would be very convenient but I don't 
know how to do them. Presently
I transpose each month's totals on my budget manually to the next month 
- this keeps me aware of what
I'm spending but takes some time. I'd like to be more oblivious - !!! - 
and save a couple minutes. Ha ha.
