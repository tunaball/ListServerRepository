It would seem that Alex is looking for someone to take some hidden 
frustrations out on.  It's sad that people like him have to pop in on 
occasion to spray venom simply because they twist words around to suit 
their threshold of justification to put people down.

Alex, I'm stating facts, not going out of my way to bash Windows.  
Anyone who's used the various Windows OS's for a while know that 
fragmentation gets to be an issue within a week of use.  I've been a 
sys admin at a large ISP where we had over a dozen different OS's 
around, so I know what I'm talking about when I say that the 
filesystems Windows uses are prone to fragmentation, whereas many 
others are not.  Furthermore, I'm speaking from experience regarding 
the fragmentation tolerance of a Mac.  Perhaps you should spend a day 
thinking about an email that makes you want to whip out the torches; 
chances are that a good bit of pondering will make you realize that 
most people who take part in this list know more and have better 
intentions than you give them credit for.  Don't turn a discussion 
about something most of us love -- Macs -- into a battle.

</I>&gt;<i> their money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As to disk fragmentation, it predates both Mac and Win. It's 
</I>&gt;<i> essentially a file system issue, and HFS (the earlier Mac OS file 
</I>&gt;<i> system) is actually more, not less, prone to it than comparable 
</I>&gt;<i> systems. It's a side-effect of HFS's unique two-fork file 
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, a sophisticated engineering feature which, 
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately, has not been adopted by other file systems. 
</I>&gt;<i> (Incidentally, the Apple reference mentioned earlier in this thread 
</I>&gt;<i> alludes to this issue -- for those who can read). HFS+, the current 
</I>&gt;<i> native Mac OS, is even slightly more susceptible than HFS to 
</I>&gt;<i> fragmentation, again, a side-effect of its more sophisticated 
</I>&gt;<i> management of allocation blocks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, for other reasons (summarized in the Apple KB article ID 
</I>&gt;<i> 25668) fragmentation is less of an issue nowadays than it was five or 
</I>&gt;<i> ten years ago. Some of those reasons apply to other computer platforms 
</I>&gt;<i> as well.
