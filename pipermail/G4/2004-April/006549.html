<PRE>Just to chime in, I've noticed the same problem with my Philips receiver 
that has a USB port. When moving from one song to the next, output will 
become very distorted when the new song is begun. Switching from the 
UAC5535B to internal audio and then back again will relieve the problem 
temporarily. Of course, my receiver is only listed with Windows 
compatability, so I can't moan about it. Are the Powerwave and 
SoundSticks supposed to be Mac-compatible? Has anyone here experienced 
this problem with hardware designed for the Macintosh?
