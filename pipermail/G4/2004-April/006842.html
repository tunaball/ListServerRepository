<PRE>I've had a 20gb Seagate Baracuda for 5 years and it's been great..not a 
problem. The stock 30gb IBM drive that came in my 450DP has worked 
flawlessly, and I've heard only good things about IBM drives. I got a Maxtor 
160gb drive last November and it's been great. In January I got a 160gb 
Seagate drive from Best Buy for $80 (after rebates) and so far it's been 
great (it's in my peecee). In the past I've seen a couple of Maxtor drives 
fail (not my own), but I'm hoping that those were just run-of-the-mill bad 
luck situations. I love Seagates, but someone else could probably tell you 
horror story with them too. I know for a fact that I won't buy a 
WesternDigital drive for a PC because of all of the hassle I've experienced 
with them.. Special drivers and applications to format the drives. This may 
not apply to you, because Macs are so much more forgiving.
If I were you, I'd keep an eye open for a decent sized drive. For my 450DP, 
I needed to buy an ATA card for my 160gb drive and I went w/the Sonet Tempo, 
but I needed another card for the 3rd drive anyway. I love the space.. have 
my 9 partitiones  (3 each) and couldn't  be happier.
Look on the web and through www.xlr8yourmac.com if your looking for specific 
info.
Others will weigh in, but I think that no matter what you go with it'll be 
ok.. just like cars, there are lemon drives every so often. Luck of the 
draw, I suppose. If you see a drive that catches your attention, do some 
searches on the net and see what others are saying out it, and/or the 
company that makes it and go from there.

</I>&gt;<i>I have two Western Digital hard drives in my G4-450 AGP (20 and 40) and use
</I>&gt;<i>the 40 as backup drive using Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC).  The old Western
</I>&gt;<i>Digital drive is getting full and needs to be replaced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What are some of the things I should look for  in shopping for a new drive
</I>&gt;<i>other than price?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The old 20 GB Western Digital (WDC WD205BA) has been great and I would like
</I>&gt;<i>the same drive with more storage.  The problem is there are so many
</I>&gt;<i>different drives on the market (even WD models) it is hard to pick one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, I know bigger is better but I really don't need the extra space.  The
</I>&gt;<i>smallest I would consider is a 40 but something like an 80 or 120 sounds
</I>&gt;<i>nice and they don't seem to be that much more expensive.
