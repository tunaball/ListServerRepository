<PRE>I have installed this very card on the same machine and been pleased 
with the result. You will definitely notice a huge speed difference.
As for worth, that is a tad more subjective. Do you have programs that 
won't run at the slower speed? (garage band comes to mind), are you 
spending tons of time waiting for photoshop files to work their 
voodoo?, or is it simply killing you that there are faster machines out 
there and although you can't (or don't choose to) afford that dual G5 
you know you can get some more juice out of your old standby?
I am embarrassed to admit I'm in the latter category. It was worth it 
to me for the enjoyment factor but I certainly could never justify the 
move in a dollars and cents equation.
Maybe this will help - BUY THIS UPGRADE NOW. YOUR LIFE WILL BE BETTER, 
YOU WILL SAVE TONS OF MONEY, AND THE WOMEN WILL FLOCK TO YOU.
Better? now put your order in.
Have fun.
