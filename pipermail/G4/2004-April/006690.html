<PRE>When you download a commercial program like OE, it is in a form called 
&quot;object code&quot;. The programming language (&quot;source code&quot;) used to write 
it (probably &quot;C&quot;) has been &quot;compiled&quot; into a language the computer can 
understand. It is legal to download and use the program, but to modify 
it requires the source code.
Unless you have the source code, you cannot carbonize something. 
Companies like Microsoft protect their source code and you aren't 
allowed to modify or even see it. So, no, it is not legal to make OE 
run in OS X, even if you could come up with the source somehow. 
Carbonizing is not a trivial undertaking and certainly is not &quot;a 
plugin&quot;. It requires knowledge of software engineering, developer tools 
and plenty of time to accomplish. Hope this answers your questions.
