<PRE>Many people have sold this type of CD. There hasn't been any objection 
by Apple to eBay about those sellers, so I am assuming that Apple does 
not care a fig about that information being distributed in this manner.

I know for a fact that Microsoft will enforce the copyright values for 
their software and try to stop older copies of programs from being sold 
via eBay. That happened to my friend. He was informed by eBay that he 
could not sell that particular item as a single item. The work-around 
was to include a piece of hardware with the software as a combined item 
auction. That way, he was selling a computer equipment package, not 
just computer software that he no longer needed or wanted.

I bought a CD off eBay that somebody had burned that had service and 
tech manuals for virtually all Apple's machines. It was not clear in 
the auction that it was a burned copy, so I'm not sure on the niceties 
of copyright on it, but it has all the iMac service manuals. Let me 
know if you're interested.
