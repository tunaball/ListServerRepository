Doing what you suggest will make the iPod susceptible to all the  
viruses that can affect any Windows formatted drive. Some iPods were  
accidentally infected at an assembly plant with a Windows only virus  
a couple of months ago and Apple apologized for releasing them to  
public sales without checking them. Apple offered to repair the iPods  
if you took them to an Apple store.

You only need to format an iPod IF you intend to connect it to a  
Windows machine. As long as you only use it with a Mac, you don't  
need to format it again unless you cause serious problems in  
operating it and need to do a hard reset.

Of course it wasn't recognized. Windows machines are not capable of  
recognizing anything that is not formatted as a Windows device. It  
would not have been permitted to load because of the &quot;alien&quot; system  
that is installed on it as a Mac iPod. The same conditions exist with  
other devices such as Zip cartridges, floppy disks (remember those?),  
flash drives, and memory sticks. If it is formatted as Mac, the  
Windows machine won't be able to see it and may ask if you want to  
initialize it. Tell it &quot;NO&quot; in big letters if it does ask!
