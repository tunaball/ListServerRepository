<PRE>Thanks everyone,I do have over 30 gigs of iTunes. What I am trying to do is
to eliminate any and all unnecessary files from the internal hard drive. I
do have external drives. Actually made a tower with 4 250 gig harddrives and
converted it from SCSI to firewire and use that for the &quot;additional space&quot;.
I do alot of movie modification/conversion and rather than let it run from
the external drives I use the internal drive then move it to the external
storage for later effects or modification at which time I return it to the
internal drive. The mini seems happier when the work is done on the internal
drive.
Since I dont want the drive tower to run all the time I prefer to keep the
iTunes on the internal drive. The movie work is moved to an external drive
when I am done playing with, it until later.
I am looking to gain about 5-6 gigs minimum of space to make the movie work
&quot;more comfortable&quot;. Currently out of an 80 gig internal drive(which shows as
a 74.4 gig drive I have 19 gigs free, 55.8 used. With 30 gigs as itunes that
means that there is about 25 gigs MOL of operating system and apps, if 3.8/4
gig is apps then the rest is just OS X. This seems excessive for just the OS
and I wanted to trim it down.
Here is the problem. I dont know where to look or what I can trim off. I am
guessing I can eliminate all the logs but dont really think that they take
up that much room. I know the &quot;extra&quot; printer drivers and info is a really
big chunk of space so would like to eliminate that ( I will try the Printer
Set Up and Repair). I just dont know what else to look for.
The mini is actually running well and does the movie modification well. I
removed the cover and am using it &quot;open&quot;, without the top. I also removed
the superdrive and am using an external firewire Sony dual layer drive and
this is working well. The mini stays cool and the fan very rarely kicks on,
and the external Sony is faster than the old internal superdrive so that
works well. With all the storage on the external drives I dont have storage
issues or heat issues with the mini so everything is really working
according to plan other than this 25 gigs of OS.
I am open to ideas. I really dont want to do a fresh install just because it
is a pain but am starting to consider it and will probably have to if I cant
recoup some drive space.
Thank you for your ideas and information and I am open to any suggestions.
