I'm wondering how you got the memory reading that you are quoting? If I 
open iTunes and then open the application &quot;Activity Monitor&quot; and let 
iTunes play for an hour the &quot;Real Memory&quot; that is used for &quot;iTunes&quot; is 
always the same &quot;48.78 MB&quot; however the &quot;Virtual Memory&quot; does change.

So all that I can surmise is that you are also out of &quot;Hard Disk&quot; 
space, which means that the iTunes application, when it is active, the 
OS doesn't have anywhere to put the iTunes baggage. i.e. you need more 
Hard Disk space so that you will have more &quot;Virtual Memory&quot; room.

Yes, Whamb is nice, but I still say that you need more disk space. And 
if your Mini can't take a bigger disk then you should get a Firewire 
disk and move all of your iTunes (application and music files) to the 
Firewire disk. Then after you are sure that you have done everything 
Okay, back-up your main disk and then delete all of the iTunes stuff on 
your main disk.

Next run &quot;Applejack&quot; to clean up the main disk. Now you should have 
enough disk space for &quot;Virtual Memory&quot; to operate.
