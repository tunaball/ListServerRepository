<PRE>Old!  I'd like to tell you about old, but that's off-topic.  I just today ordered from OWC &lt;<A HREF="http://www.macsales.com">http://www.macsales.com</A>&gt; a Sonnet Tango Express PCI card, 3 USB2 and 2 FireWire400 ports.  $93.50 delivered.  It's a bit pricy, but I wanted to add USB2 capabilities to my Quicksilver 2000.  I had a cheapie combo card in that slot that had 3 slots on the card and and 3 external ports (that never worked) with 2 FireWire 400 ports (that did work).  It's about a year old. My computer began freezing after about 15 minutes.  System Profiler would quit out when I asked for FireWire info.  I pulled the card and I've been up for about 4 hours.

I like Sonnet products.  I've used their processor upgrades in every Mac I've owned (starting with a 6100) and got good tech support from them when needed.  Now I'm running a dual 1.8 GHz in the Quicksilver.

Good luck in whatever you decide.

Nate

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Greetings ( + )!( + )
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pat I don't understand what &quot;old&quot; has to do with anything, I'm  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;old&quot; too, been working on computers for more than 40 years, I  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would recommend that you get something like the &quot;Adesso 4-Port  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Powered Hub Mini Hub&quot; because the devices that you connect to the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hub will not draw power from your Mac. platform. which is important  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because the more power the you use from the Mac. the shorter the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; life expecentancy of your Mac. system. And if something happens to  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the &quot;Wall-Wart&quot; they are easy and cheep to replace.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Below is Overview of the Adesso Mini Hub and you can obtain one  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from <A HREF="http://www.pcuniverse.com/product.asp?pid=62800&m_id=32">http://www.pcuniverse.com/product.asp?pid=62800&amp;m_id=32</A> for  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $6.41 each plus $6.98 shipping.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Adesso offers USB Mini 4-Port powered mini hub. This hub supports  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; both high-speed and low-speed devices. Its ports are reliable at up  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to 4,5 m of transmission. Downstream ports have automatic connect  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and speed detection function plus over-current protection with auto  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recovery. Bus fault detection will automatically reset device. The  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hub supports bus-powered and self-powered mode.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Don't worry if it doesn't state that it's for a Mac. the USB  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standard is a IEEE regulated standard and all platforms that state  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that they run USB must meet the standard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> I use a six-port &quot;IoGear powered hub, which has a compact flash card  
</I>&gt;<i> reader in it.  In addition to the hub connection (printers, hard  
</I>&gt;<i> drives, scanner, etc.) I keep a 2GB compact flash card installed,  
</I>&gt;<i> which acts as a quickie HD for moving miscellaneous data back and forth.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The hub was about $29.95 and the 2GB CF card is now about $40.
</I></PRE>
