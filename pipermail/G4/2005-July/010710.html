Dave I know that you've already heard this, but the smiley face /? 
means that the boot-rom can not find a valid system (OS) from which to 
complete the loading process. That means that boot-rom  has tested 
memory and is now ready to turn the loading process over to an OS. 
Something like a PC there is set of instructions that tells the 
boot-rom to look at disk drives.

My advice would be to first reset nonvolatile ram. You can do that by 
holding down the &quot;Command&quot; &quot;Option&quot; &quot;N&quot; &amp; &quot;R&quot; keys when you turn-on 
power.

If that doesn't help then next reset the &quot;P&quot; ram. You can do that by 
holding down the &quot;Command&quot; &quot;Option&quot; &quot;P&quot; &amp; &quot;R&quot; keys when you turn-on 
power. You should remain holding down these keys until the &quot;Boot-Ram&quot; 
try's to restart the system at least three (3) times. In other words 
don't release these keys until you have heard the &quot;bong&quot; three (3) 
times.

Next if you have a CD from Apple that has a &quot;System Folder&quot; on it, hold 
down the &quot;C&quot; key when you turn-on power. When starting from the CD, 
remain holding down the &quot;C&quot; key until you can observe the loading 
process has started.

Good luck

I know, when people see a cat's litter box, they always say, &quot;Oh, have 
you got a cat?&quot;&#160; Just once I want to say, &quot;No, it's for company!&quot;
