I'll just insert a couple of comments here.
I have found that when you have more than two USB devices, it's a good 
idea if you use a powered USB hub.
You don't mention whether your hub is merely a multiple port feed from 
an existing USB port, or it's powered with it's own AC transformer.
I solved a number of mysterious USB problems by going to a powered hub.

&gt;<i> Just out of curiosity I plugged the printer into the second USB port on 
</I>&gt;<i> the monitor and the scanner into the left USB socket on the keyboard and 
</I>&gt;<i> now the G4 recognizes them. Hrrmph! And I thought I'd been thorough in 
</I>&gt;<i> eliminating the USB hub as a factor in the equation. I guess not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, in the interim I had re-downloaded and re-installed the 
</I>&gt;<i> applicable software for both peripherals (yet again...&lt;SIGH&gt;), so 
</I>&gt;<i> there's no telling whether that had an additional positive effect on the 
</I>&gt;<i> outcome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fact is, though, that communication is restored between the G4 and 
</I>&gt;<i> peripherals, which is a HUGE relief. Now I'm wondering if the USB hub is 
</I>&gt;<i> the issue or the USB port in the G4 (a situation I have yet to 
</I>&gt;<i> determine). I guess I'm very fortunate that I have enough ports (between 
</I>&gt;<i> those on the monitor and the keyboard) to run all my peripherals for the 
</I>&gt;<i> time being.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to all of you who responded and offered your experience. I must 
</I>&gt;<i> admit I'm a trifle embarrassed I didn't catch the problem before posting 
</I>&gt;<i> my inquiry, but as I said, the problem with the USB hub seems to be 
</I>&gt;<i> transient. For all I know in a few days it may work again &lt;shrug&gt;...
