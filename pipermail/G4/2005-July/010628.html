<PRE>
Dan,

Why not just use the built-in ethernet to transfer your data. Both of  
your computers have ethernet ports?


So all you really need is a  ethernet cable, you can get one for less  
than $5.00. It may be a little slower than the firewire method, but  
it will get done what you want done and you will not have to add any  
PCI firewire cards to your G3(which are not exactly cheap) for a one  
time file transfer. In general all you need to do is plug in the  
ethernet cable (looks like a wide telephone cord jack) into the G3  
and the other end into the G4. Turn on file sharing and you are all  
set to transfer files.

Here is some help from apple on how to copy files between computers.  
This tells you what you have to do to set this up.

Good luck and let us know if you have any questions or trouble.

More Options Below  regarding the SCSI drive.........

Note:  To others,

The beige G3's do not have firewire ports, the first macs to have  
firewire was probably the Blue and white G3's.

No you can't connect a SCSI drive to an ATA controller. Two different  
beasts there... You would need a SCSI card in your G4 to connect a  
SCSI drive to it. So unless you have a SCSI card that you put into  
the G4 you can't put the SCSI hard drive from the G3 into the G4 to  
transfer files.

I did some research from everymac.com and it turns out that since  
your G3 has a SCSI hard drive it is powered by a removable PCI SCSI  
card that you could remove and install into the G4 to transfer the  
files. And since it is working on the G3 on 10.3 it must be  
compatible with os X so it should work as well temporarily in the G4  
with 10.4. So with this option you would have to remove the SCSI card  
and hard drive from the G3 and then install both into the G4 to do  
the file transfer.

So it is up to you what you want to do, but I would go with the  
ethernet networking option it is much easier to do and will take less  
of your time and energy to set up...
