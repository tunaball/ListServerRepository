<PRE>Hi Anthony,

I've experienced the same sort of thing with my Epson Stylus 2200.  It's
sometimes a bear to keep 
the driver and printer recognized.  Mainly, we go back into the Print
Utility dialogs to make sure 
that the printer is selected as the default.  Sometimes the printer icon
can be opened to restart the 
print queue.  From time to time we also resort to Gimp Print, see
Versiontracker, to recognize the 
printer.

Not too much ryhme or reason to it.  I'd blame the Epson software, since
othjer peripherals don't 
exhibit the same behavior.

As for the scanner, I've heard that Silverfast (?) works well, but also
costs more than many 
scanners...

HTH,

jon

Subject: [G4] G4 refuses to recognize printer and scanner


Hi experts,

After I upgraded to OS X 10.3.9 from OS 9.2.2 back in May I began 
having difficulty getting the Mac to recognize my printer and scanner. 
I downloaded the appropriate drivers from the Epson site for my 1270 
inkjet and 1200U Scanner, and was able to use both scanner and printer 
until last week. Now, the G4 won't recognize either printer or scanner 
at all, whreas I was able to get both to work (I was scanning in 
Photoshop 7 (OS X native) and printing from both Photoshop and Quark 
4.1 (Classic).

I should mention that before the Mac stopped recognizing the printer 
altogether, the inkjet would someimtes get part-way through a job and 
then quit; the printer-status window would state that the Mac stopped 
sending the job. Reason unknown. These were not particularly large or 
complicated jobs, either. I used to print similar work without issue on 
the inkjet in OS 9.

I keep running System Optimizer X to repair permissions, clear the 
cache, and do all sorts of other maintenance tasks hoping it will &quot;fix&quot; 
something the way it often does when Mail hangs on launch 
(inexplicably), but no luck.

Both pieces of equipment worked fine previously, and aren't &quot;worn-out&quot;, 
so I'm really flummoxed by this. I've looked over the obvious, and now 
I'm in need of expert assistance. As stated, the printer and scanner 
are both in very good shape; the cables check out, etc.

Anyone have any ideas of what's wrong -- and of any preventive 
maintenance I can perform to prohibit this in the future?

Thanks in advance,
Anthony

PS: I haven't even tried to install my Pioneer 109 yet what with all 
the trouble I've been having in the past weeks with the Mac hanging on 
apps and now not recognizing my scanner and printer...one of these days 
I'll get around to that.
