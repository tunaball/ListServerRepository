<PRE>Well, folks, here's an update on my 
G4-not-communicating-with-the-scanner-and-printer situation: it seems 
like it all might boil down to an issue with my USB hub rather than a 
software issue with the G4 and peripherals. However, the issue with the 
hub seems transient, and I'm not sure what that means.

Over a week ago my cursor froze while I was in Mail (the first freeze 
I've had in OS X, btw), and suddenly my keyboard and mouse were 
inactive (they are usually plugged into my monitor's USB sockets. In 
troubleshooting, I plugged the keyboard/mouse into the USB hub which 
reactivated them (which at least told me it wasn't the keyboard/mouse 
that were at fault). After some optimizing and restarts and wondering, 
&quot;what NOW?&quot; I found the USB ports in the monitor worked once again. But 
it was around that same time that the printer and scanner stopped being 
recognized.

Just out of curiosity I plugged the printer into the second USB port on 
the monitor and the scanner into the left USB socket on the keyboard 
and now the G4 recognizes them. Hrrmph! And I thought I'd been thorough 
in eliminating the USB hub as a factor in the equation. I guess not.

Of course, in the interim I had re-downloaded and re-installed the 
applicable software for both peripherals (yet again...&lt;SIGH&gt;), so 
there's no telling whether that had an additional positive effect on 
the outcome.

Fact is, though, that communication is restored between the G4 and 
peripherals, which is a HUGE relief. Now I'm wondering if the USB hub 
is the issue or the USB port in the G4 (a situation I have yet to 
determine). I guess I'm very fortunate that I have enough ports 
(between those on the monitor and the keyboard) to run all my 
peripherals for the time being.

Thanks to all of you who responded and offered your experience. I must 
admit I'm a trifle embarrassed I didn't catch the problem before 
posting my inquiry, but as I said, the problem with the USB hub seems 
to be transient. For all I know in a few days it may work again 
&lt;shrug&gt;...

Cheers,
Anthony
