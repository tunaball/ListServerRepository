<PRE>Hey Steve,

Well, I also have a Mercury Extreme 1.5Ghz upgrade processor, for my 
Sawtooth,
and never did the chess test until today, have notice, from time to time,
when the process reach 100%, the application would quit.

However, with the Chess test, the application did in fact quit 2 in a row,
never got to 5 games, ( setting where default with computer vs computer )

So, you mention OWC will replace the processor?
how does one get the ball rolling for a new processor, that can pass the 
Chess Test.?


Richard

&gt;<i>BACKGROUND: I had reported that my OWC Mercury Extreme 1.4 GHz processor upgrade was the culprit that was causing my Quicksilver 2002 to go crazy on me (weird font substitutions, freezing), and all this learned after hunting down, testing, and rejecting just about all other possibilities first.  OWC was VERY cooperative in accepting the processor upgrade for replacement.  The replacement processor has worked well for several days already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>CHESS: I wrote to ask OWC Tech Support about testing the new processor, because, even though it seems to be working properly, Apple Hardware Test (CD that comes with new Macs) reported the same errors as with the defective processor.  Their reply was very interesting and worth sharing--PLAY CHESS:
