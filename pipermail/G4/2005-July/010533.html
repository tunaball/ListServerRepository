<PRE>Sorry, perhaps I should have been more specific: My USB hub is an AC 
powered one (Belkin), and &quot;appeared&quot; to be working okay. &lt;shrug&gt; I've 
had it as long as I've had the G4.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that were at fault). After some optimizing and restarts and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wondering, &quot;what NOW?&quot; I found the USB ports in the monitor worked 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> once again. But it was around that same time that the printer and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scanner stopped being recognized.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll just insert a couple of comments here.
</I>&gt;<i> I have found that when you have more than two USB devices, it's a good 
</I>&gt;<i> idea if you use a powered USB hub.
</I>&gt;<i> You don't mention whether your hub is merely a multiple port feed from 
</I>&gt;<i> an existing USB port, or it's powered with it's own AC transformer.
</I>&gt;<i> I solved a number of mysterious USB problems by going to a powered hub.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> keith whaley
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just out of curiosity I plugged the printer into the second USB port 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the monitor and the scanner into the left USB socket on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keyboard and now the G4 recognizes them. Hrrmph! And I thought I'd 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been thorough in eliminating the USB hub as a factor in the equation. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, in the interim I had re-downloaded and re-installed the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applicable software for both peripherals (yet again...&lt;SIGH&gt;), so 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there's no telling whether that had an additional positive effect on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the outcome.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fact is, though, that communication is restored between the G4 and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peripherals, which is a HUGE relief. Now I'm wondering if the USB hub 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the issue or the USB port in the G4 (a situation I have yet to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> determine). I guess I'm very fortunate that I have enough ports 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (between those on the monitor and the keyboard) to run all my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peripherals for the time being.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks to all of you who responded and offered your experience. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> must admit I'm a trifle embarrassed I didn't catch the problem before 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> posting my inquiry, but as I said, the problem with the USB hub seems 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be transient. For all I know in a few days it may work again 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;shrug&gt;...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anthony
