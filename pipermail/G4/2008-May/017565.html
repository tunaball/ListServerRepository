&gt;<i> &gt; So what is your sound card? That seems to be the only
</I>&gt;<i> thing that can't be done with a Mac-mini :-) The modern
</I>&gt;<i> approach &gt;is to use a usb or firewire connected audio
</I>&gt;<i> interface which the mini could handle. The G4's 1.5Gb
</I>&gt;<i> ram will not be usable in a &gt;MDD.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I use an M-Audio Delta-1010.  It's a multi- I/O PCI
</I>&gt;<i> card.  Why won't the memory be usable here?
</I>
Because the MDD needs PC2100 memory in the 1.0 GHz model, PC2700 memory in faster models. This is a different type from that used in the earlier G4's (PC100 and PC133).

&gt;<i> &gt; I also use an ATTO UL3S SCSI card (because it's
</I>&gt;<i> qualified for use with ProTools by Digidesign) and a couple
</I>&gt;<i> of fast SCSI &gt;drives. I think this helps speed up the
</I>&gt;<i> system by reducing the load on the cpu's.
</I>&gt;<i> Tell me more about this?  I just purchased a scsi card off
</I>&gt;<i> ebay, as I would like to use Recycle with my hardware
</I>&gt;<i> sampler. I don't know if I can, but I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> give it a try.
</I>
I am using the UL3S to hook up two internally mounted 18Gb 10Krpm U160 SCSI hard drives. One I use for the OS and apps, the second I use for recording the music too. The UL3S also has an external connector which could be used to connect to your hardware sampler. I presume it has a SCSI port. A UL3D (the dual channel version) would probably be better for that since you could put it on it's own bus. 
   
&gt;<i> &gt; I have an upgraded (flashed PC) video card so I can
</I>&gt;<i> run dual 17&quot; LCD monitors. The extra desktop area
</I>&gt;<i> really helps when &gt;running ProTools. A couple of
</I>&gt;<i> second-hand LCD doesn't cost that much but IMHO is a
</I>&gt;<i> much better investment than the &gt;typical cpu upgrade.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm looking into this same thing.  I've seen a few
</I>&gt;<i> fairly cheap on ebay.  I've also seen one, (I can't
</I>&gt;<i> remember the model right now) that is carried by PCWorld,
</I>&gt;<i> that is supposed to be able to be flashed.  I'm going
</I>&gt;<i> to at least look into this. 
</I>
I bought from eBay seller &quot;mac_geniuses&quot;. He does a lot of Mac video cards. I have no relation to him other than I have been a satisfied customer.

&gt;<i> &gt; For straight sound recording and midi sequencing
</I>&gt;<i> (which is what I do) I don't think you need as much
</I>&gt;<i> horsepower as video &gt;applications (for example). 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> This is pretty much what I do, but I am now venturing into
</I>&gt;<i> soft synth/effects.  I mainly work in midi(hardware), but
</I>&gt;<i> also record vocals.  For the stuff I do, I'm looking at
</I>&gt;<i> using Melodyne for timestretching/pitchshifting harmonies
</I>&gt;<i> etc..  This can take a bit of horsepower.
</I>
I tried using my 867MHz G4 12&quot; PowerBook with Ableton Live 7. It works fine when driving external midi, and sampled audio, (which is what I do) but couldn't handle the the soft synths without the sound breaking up. That doesn't bother me, but it got me realizing how out dated my &quot;baby&quot; is now.
I think we are really at the same point - only I've gone PC, and you're trying to go Mac :-)

There is a point here that LEM has been also banging on about and that is the lack of an expandable mid-range Mac tower in the current Apple line-up. We are both limited by our choice of a PCI soundcard to using either a PC box or an older Mac. The application I am wanting to run will run on both platforms, but to get the performance and PCI I have to run a PC. I could do it with a iMac and a firewire interface. But like most people, I try to keep my hobby costs to a minimum.

Maybe I need to turn it into a Hankentosh:

&gt;<i> I picked up the Dual 450 really cheap a while back, and was
</I>&gt;<i> hoping to be able to slowly upgrade it into something which
</I>&gt;<i> could be of 'real' use.  But my research says I
</I>&gt;<i> won't be able to.  
</I>
I still refuse to do anything else on a PC. I'd rather a slower dual 450 G4 and OSX than XP!
