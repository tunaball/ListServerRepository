<PRE>Hi Rick,

I agree with Eric, SATA is the way to go. I think the drives are cheaper and
the performance better. There are two web sites that you might want to
explore -- Tigerdirect.com  and  Newegg.com .

Both sites are excellent and their delivery times are unbelievable. But you
can explore the two sites for SATA drives and controllers. I have a QS 2001
and I installed a SATA card and drives without much difficulty  -- hell man
-- we are working with Macs!!!!

But SATA is the way !! 

PS: There was a great deal of correspondence on this issue about 9 months,
perhaps a year ago. Check the archives.

Rich

Hi Rick,

In my opinion you would get much better disk performance if you went to a
SATA drive with 3 Gb/s transfer rate. This is often referred to as &quot;SATA 2&quot;
or &quot;SATA II&quot; but that is actually a misnomer. It is the same spec as the
original SATA drives, the only difference being double the transfer rate.

If I am correct, the QS 2002 uses UltraATA/66, meaning a 66 MB/s transfer
rate. Since SATA uses 8b10b encoding on the wire (i.e., each byte is
converted to 10-bit code), 3 Gb/s effectively means a transfer rate of 300
MB/s. Even if the QS 2002 uses ATA/133, that would still be less than half
the transfer rate of &quot;SATA 2&quot;.

If you look for &quot;SATA 2&quot; - again that just means 3 Gb/s - make sure that
both the PCI controller card and the drive support the higher data transfer
rate. Having to buy a separate controller is an extra expense, but in my
opinion worth it for the extra speed.

You also definitely want a USB 2.0 card (should be available for cheap) if
you are going to make significant use of USB.
