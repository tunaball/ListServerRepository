<PRE>hi,

it sounded like what you really need is USB handy drive/flash drive which can be obtained in various capacities ranging from 64MB all the way to 1GB, depending on how much you want to spend.. what you really need is just the USB port, and almost all PCs and Mac has USB port these days... 

i have this 
<A HREF="http://www.apacer.com/apacer_english/product_html/handy_steno_ht202.asp">http://www.apacer.com/apacer_english/product_html/handy_steno_ht202.asp</A>

you can probably find them in all compter shops.. generic brand and all, even some of them can be used as mp3 players...

personally, i wouldny worry about CDR/CDRW stuffs, what i use them these days are only for backups... even my zip drive is sitting in my G4 unpowered (took off the power cable to it).. i havent use it for the last 3 years.. too slow to my patience...

regards..

</I>If this doesn't work out the way I want it to,  then I'm just going to use a Zip disk instead.  I think you can format those in an MSDOS 
format and that will be readable by both platforms.  If that is so, then it is probably possible to just pop files off and on the Zip as I 
want with both computers with no trouble.  It would be worth the extra  8 dollars or so.  I don't think I'll need that much space,  but CD's 
are cooler and I know from experience that i tend to go crazy when I  collect media and work on projects.  It might take 2 zips for this 
class.  What ya think?

(P.S.  G4 listers,  sorry if carbon copying this to you is against list rules or something,  but it just seems like something you might wanna 
read)
