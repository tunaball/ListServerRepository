</I>Anne:

I'm catching up on traffic here.  You do not say which &quot;733&quot; you have.
There were two 733 models, and you probably have two or three fans.  The
first 733 was the highest, single CPU model in the &quot;Digital Audio&quot; series
which also had the dual 533 at the top end.  After that came the QuickSilver
733 which was the low end of that series.

I agonized over my purchases because of loudness.  First, I bought the
Digital Audio 733 at discount after the QuickSilver machines hit the stores.
The fan(s) were too loud, along with a high pitched whine that really set
off my ears to ringing.  Too bad, because I brought it back and came away
with the QuickSilver 733 for a higher price and without the L3 cache.  I
hear this machine, but the pitch is OK.

&gt;<i> I'm hard of hearing, so I'm not sure how loud it is. It's just loud
</I>&gt;<i> enough to notice, and all I'm doing is email.
</I>
What AppleCare told you is hoowie!  The automatic controls for fan speeds
based on workload came in OS X for machines later than both 733s, beginning
with the so-called wind tunnels.  My QuickSilver 733 fans run at the same
high speed all the time.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this machine has issues with fans. Any input? It's okay for
</I>&gt;<i> it to be loud, but I want to be aware if it is getting too loud so I
</I>&gt;<i> can get it repaired, replaced, etc. before I'm in the middle of a
</I>&gt;<i> crucial project or something.
</I>
I'd be concerned if you start hearing squealing or nothing at all.
Otherwise, just dust it off outside and a bit inside with your semi-annual
house cleaning.

Good luck,
