</I>&gt;<i>

10.2.8 update had two releases. The first one did me fine on my machine 
(dual 867) but as a consultant, reports of ethernet failure on certain 
mac models as well as servers made me rethink a policy. I had to run 
around and do the ethernet patch before the second 10.2.8 hit the 
streets.  Not fun.

Especially nice was apple not acknowledging it publicly for at least 4 
days. Ya say 4 days is ok? Try telling that to people who need to work, 
servers that go down, and the like. 4 days of hell.

If you can re-install the 10.2.8 update, the second one(current) did 
fix a lot of issues where ethernets would get hosed totally (and this 
is not a minor issue in the admin community!) did fix the first 10.2.8. 
  What a fumble on the Apple team. I do hope somebody got fired. A minor 
update did kill ethernet ports essentially killing all traffic that a 
desktop or a server needed.

Re-installing the second 10.2.8 update more than once is sometimes 
needed. There are patches out because of the first 10.2.8 update. I may 
be able to still find them.

Please contact me off-lis and I will locate the patcht. I Came out of 
lurking because this was a sore spot.
