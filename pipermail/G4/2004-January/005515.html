<PRE>If this doesn't work out the way I want it to,  then I'm just going to 
use a Zip disk instead.  I think you can format those in an MSDOS 
format and that will be readable by both platforms.  If that is so, 
then it is probably possible to just pop files off and on the Zip as I 
want with both computers with no trouble.  It would be worth the extra 
8 dollars or so.  I don't think I'll need that much space,  but CD's 
are cooler and I know from experience that i tend to go crazy when I 
collect media and work on projects.  It might take 2 zips for this 
class.  What ya think?

(P.S.  G4 listers,  sorry if carbon copying this to you is against list 
rules or something,  but it just seems like something you might wanna 
read)

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> remember--outside of VPC, the Mac might not read--or create--unclosed 
</I>&gt;<i> PC CD sessions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like some experimentation is in order. (Hey, that's what the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'RW' in CD-RW is for, right?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And when I burn a CD on a mac the PC can read it,  right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A straight burn from the Finder will create a Mac/PC hybrid disk, 
</I>&gt;<i> readable by either machine, but I don't know if Mac can burn 
</I>&gt;<i> session-only in this format (or in straight ISO-9660, for that &gt; matter).
</I>&gt;<i>
