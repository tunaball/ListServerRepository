<PRE>Hi all. I went home last night and wasn't able to connect to the internet 
with either my browser
or mail. I've had RR service for about 3 months with no problems until last 
night. I sat on the phone
w/tech support for about 3 hours troubleshooting and re-troubleshooting. 
Finally they said that
they would send someone out today. After I hung up I disconnected the cable 
modem and took
it over to my PC, set it up and it connects fine.
I'm running OS 10.2.8, but if I boot into OS 9.2 it doesn't connect either. 
I've read that there
were problems with 10.2.8, but I installed it on Oct 7 and there had been no 
signs of problems
until now.

Here's what I've done:
Turned off Mac's firewall and the Brickhouse firewall, Reset Pram, Reset 
Cuda, did a Ping test with
100% packet loss, shut the computer down for the night, reset trhe Toshiba 
Modem. I don't know
much about it, but it looks as though System Profiler says everything is ok. 
RR says that they are
able to communicate w/the modem... the modem just isn't communicating w/the 
G4.
I live alone, so noone was near the computer since I last was on the 
internet 2 days ago so nothing
was changed since last successful conenction. I am planning on setting up a 
wireless network in
the near future w/the PC, but as of now, the G4 sits alone and the Cable 
modem is connected
directly to the built in ethernet.

If OS 9.2 won't connect either it can't be the 10.2.8 netowork problem can 
it? Is there a
possibility that the built in ethernet card is bad??

Any help/suggestions would be Greatly Appreciated!
-kevin
