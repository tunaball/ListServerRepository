<PRE>I just purchased two Pioneer DVR-106D &quot;SuperDrives&quot; from OWC at 
MacWorld SF ($135 ea.), as replacement for the original optical drive 
that came with my PowerMac G4. Here are my machine specs:

Powermac G4, DP 450 MHz (&quot;Gigabit Ethernet&quot;)
896mb RAM
Mac OS 10.3.2

The installation went without a hitch and I went about immediately 
burning some CDs. However upon attempting to burn a third CD I 
immediately got a message saying the burn failed. I couldn't even eject 
the unburned CD as the drive wouldn't respond to either the Eject 
keyboard button, nor pressing the eject button on front of the drive 
itself. It took a reboot to get the drive &quot;back&quot;, but this behavior was 
consistently repeated after 1 or 2 burns. Rebooting only fixes the 
problem temporarily. In addition, after this behavior there was a 
change in what the System Profiler reported on the drive:

Before burning problems:

PIONEER DVD-RW DVR-106D:
   Manufacturer:	PIONEER
   Model:	PIONEER DVD-RW DVR-106D
   Revision:	1.07
   Serial Number:	CLDC446233WL
   Drive Type:	CD-RW/DVD-RW
   Disc Burning:	Apple Supported/Shipped
   Removable Media:	Yes
   Detachable Drive:	No
   Protocol:	ATAPI
   Unit Number:	0
   Socket Type:	Internal

Immediately after burning problems, these two lines are *missing* from 
the description:
Manufacturer:	PIONEER
Disc Burning:	Apple Supported/Shipped

The drive acts as if it loses power after either some period of time or 
activity. After manually ejecting a disk, the tray has to be re-closed 
manually - as if there is no power coming to the drive.

Here is what I tried (unsuccessfully) to troubleshoot the problem:
1. Since I had purchased a second drive for a friend, I tried swapping 
the drives.
2. Reset the PRAM
3. Hit the reset switch on the motherboard
4. Confirmed that the jumper on the drive was in the &quot;Master&quot; position

OWC tech support doesn't know what the problem is. Haven't tried using 
the drive with iDVD yet.

Any ideas out there?

TIA, Eric Gold
