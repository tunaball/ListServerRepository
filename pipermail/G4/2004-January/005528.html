<PRE>There haven't been any electrical storms, but lotsa snow here in NW PA!
My apartment actually has very good electricity and I'm pretty sure the
landlord ran all new wiring when he remodeled a couple years back.
Although I probably should, I don't have a battery backup... just a couple
of serge protectors with fuses... I'd asume thatthe fuse would blow if there
was a problem serge. No I don't yet have router, I'm planning on getting a
Linksys broadband G router in the next week or so. Built in ethernet does
show but, but no IP addresses show up. I'm not sure what that  means,
but RR seems to think it was bad.

I installed the developer's tools, but I'm lost as to what I'm looking for.
AppleMacRiscPCI&gt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/g4.html">Ethernet at F</A> etc... Any clue on what I'm looking for or is an
issue of if I don't know it's too complicated and may as well not even 
bother?

The same enet cable is being used on the PC.. everthing the same. I didn't
yet install any new OS's, but maybe I will. There's no CompUSA around here
and I think it's be hard to find anywhere that will sell Mac hardware such 
as
enet cards. I guess I'll have to scour the net..

Man I hate PC's, but I have this one for troubleshooting web bugs and I 
guess
I'm kind of glad I have it at the moment.

Thanks for the help...Any other suggestions? I guess I won't know until I do 
a
fresh install another OS.. I guess I'll jump on that now.

Thanks again.

</I>&gt;<i>have there been any storms in your area? does your apt/house have &quot;weird&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>electricity? do you have a router/switch you could connect the mac to for 
</I>&gt;<i>testing? does built in ethernet come up as an option in the network prefs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>do you have apple's developer tools installed? if so, use an application 
</I>&gt;<i>called &quot;IO Registry Explorer&quot; to look-see if the ethernet shows up to the 
</I>&gt;<i>system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>i have seen voltage spikes do odd things, especially here at work-it has 
</I>&gt;<i>sent many a machine down for the count, thus we now have office wide line 
</I>&gt;<i>conditioners in addition to battery backup. lightening can also do the same 
</I>&gt;<i>thing. are you using the same enet cable for the pc and mac? if not, try a 
</I>&gt;<i>new one. i would also try installing a new/fresh copy of os x or 9 on 
</I>&gt;<i>another disk, and trying it with that. finally, i believe compusa sells 
</I>&gt;<i>their brand of enet cards that actually work with os x (and only cost about 
</I>&gt;<i>$10) it could be worth a shot to see if that works... (if there is a 
</I>&gt;<i>compusa nearby)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>ok. RR says that they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>able to communicate w/the modem... the modem just isn't communicating 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>w/the G4.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I live alone, so noone was near the computer since I last was on the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the near future w/the PC, but as of now, the G4 sits alone and the Cable 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>modem is connected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>directly to the built in ethernet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>If OS 9.2 won't connect either it can't be the 10.2.8 netowork problem can
