<PRE>Wow! That's a lot of fear you've got bottled up there. :-)

In general: lighten up. What you're planning to do is absolutely normal and 
simple, and shouldn't cause you any heartburn. Basically you will
 (*) Insert installation CD
 (*) Reboot with &quot;C&quot; key held down
 (*) Optionally, launch the disk tool and format/partition the disk
 (*) Pick the right partition to install into
 (*) Install

You can then switch between Jaguar and Panther using the startup 
preferences/control panel, or by holding down the Option key while 
rebooting to get the &quot;pick disk&quot; menu. Everything's going to be all right.

Now if you *must* know the answers to your fears, here are some:

You can install Panther and Jaguar versions on different partitions (on the 
same or different disks) and boot them both without problems. They will not 
mess up existing filesystems. This will not change your OF settings (unless 
you perform certain arcane rituals involving installation over the network).

The only supported way to get a case sensitive filesystem is to use UFS. I 
would strongly discourage you from doing this; UFS performs like a dog, and 
has no fork support. If you absolutely must have case sensitivity for some 
work, partition the disk, install the system into an HFS+ partition, and 
format a separate work partition for UFS.

During OS installation, you boot off the installation CD. It doesn't matter 
whether (or what type) of existing system(s) you have on other disks. 
Nothing will be installed into partitions that are not the install target. 
Just don't install into the wrong place. :-)

If you want to make it physically certain that your Mac can't write to a 
disk, you have to either disconnect it (using the ATA or power cables), or 
jumper the drive to write-protect mode. Neither is necessary for what you 
say you're going to do, but I understand paranoia. :-) If you do this, make 
sure your Mac is off when you do it, and ground yourself properly.

Both Jaguar and Panther support journaled HFS+. Enabling journaling during 
install (well, formatting) is *not* a problem, and it helps stability 
(though it slows things down *slightly*). A non-journal HFS+ system (say, 
9.2) will be able to use a journaled filesystem just fine *if* it was shut 
down cleanly, though of course it won't use journaling itself.

Some of the mechanisms of remote filesystem mounting have changed from 
Jaguar to Panther, so you *may* need to re-work any custom hacks you did. 
Most of the changes are in autoimmune functionality though, so if you 
explicitly invoke mount_afp, you're probably okay (except for changes to 
explicit mount point paths, of course).

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> Telnet to an Intel box running Linux has been productive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have backed up the entire contents of the disk &quot;Luna&quot; to CD-ROM's using
</I>&gt;<i> an Mac 5500 which I trust;., The next step (without a pun) is to install
</I>&gt;<i> Panther on Luna. I have asked that the disk be reinitialized with a
</I>&gt;<i> case-sensitive format if possible. I pray that, after that, it will be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to boot into Jaguar from the existing image on Mir.  But it's
</I>&gt;<i> not so clear. It's possible that the installation of Panther will muck
</I>&gt;<i> with EEPROM in a manner that will make it impossible to reboot into
</I>&gt;<i> Jaguar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if I need to physically disconnect the ATA cable to the Mir
</I>&gt;<i> disk to prevent unanticipated changes. I'm thinking about that and would
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate any advice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kit points out that installation of Panther may cause a reboot into
</I>&gt;<i> Jaguar to fail. I have spent a lot of time persuading Jaguar to use my
</I>&gt;<i> SE/30 running Mac OS 7.5.3 as a file server. Connecting to the server has
</I>&gt;<i> required that I learn about system calls mount_afp and the like and I
</I>&gt;<i> fully expect that my startup shell scripts will require modification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt that I can execute ControlPanels:StartupDisk to choose a new boot
</I>&gt;<i> partition but I'm pretty sure I can physically disconnect Luna and
</I>&gt;<i> reboot.  Where are the instructions? How does one choose a startup disk
</I>&gt;<i> in Panther? Do I have to install it to find out?

</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise just do something. There is NOTHING of serious importance in OS

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And. . . I intend to keep it that way. OSA 9.1 has everything important

</I>&gt;<i> inviting the press to observe the procedure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Steve is NOT to be trusted. The G4 is truly for play only. If it doesn't

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I really hope is that the PRAM or BOOT ROM are not being mucked with
