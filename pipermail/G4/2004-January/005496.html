<PRE>I guess this shows us that Apple is making significant changes to the 
underlying OS, which is good, because Windows Applications seems to run 
a long time. This is probably why virus are so potent on windows, they 
have had 8 years to learn how to exploit it with  little changes done 
to the os  ..

Here is the reality from a buying perspective...  For example I bought 
this ancient Software compiler called Turbo C++, it was made in 1994, 
and it seems to run with out a hitch on Windows XP? Now on the other 
hand my encyclopedia software built for mac os X World Book v 6.0 from 
2000 or 2001 is completely useless now on 10.3. Luckily a local user 
group gave me the jaguar version in exchange for a review of the app. I 
expect it to be probably be broke when &quot;we&quot; install 10.4  just like the 
original WB. These are not utilities either if they were I could expect 
them to be broken.... The mac application WB 6.0 was a flagship Cocoa 
application, now its broke / garbage. However, a Carbon Application 
Ultralingua ESP-ENG from 2001 still works fine.....

Windows ----Good Compatibility over the long haul for older apps 
(Sparingly about 5-8 years) for certain apps.

Mac OS X  ---- Limited [Could be a better word here] Compatibility over 
the long haul (6-months to 24-months) for certain apps

There has to be a &quot;happy medium&quot; between this...  Just something to 
think about
