</I>&gt;<i>      Lots of comments here....

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I don't see anything particularly cryptic about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  All I want to do is make monthly backups of my whole hard drive [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;All I want to do is drive to the supermarket and get the groceries.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Can't do it without learning to drive...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      It may not have been meant that way, but this just comes off 
</I>&gt;<i> sounding more than a bit snottty. I had performed backups for years 
</I>&gt;<i> on Digital OpenVMS systems before I started using Retrospect ten 
</I>&gt;<i> years or so ago, and the documentation was as impenetrable to me then 
</I>&gt;<i> as it is lucid now --- it all depends on your experience. (In my 
</I>&gt;<i> case, familiar terms were used in an unfamiliar, and even 
</I>&gt;<i> counterintuitive way....since, as Sir Peter Medawar once put it, &quot;All 
</I>&gt;<i> intuition is based on experience.&quot;) If you have none, the 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation may be so much gibberish.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a different class altogether.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Agreed; absolutely.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;time  to spend $59.00 ( for Example I bought  5.1 update in July 2003)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;for an upgrade to get back to full functionality. This seems to repeat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;itself every 6 months Now since i have panther 10.3 I have to yet again
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;upgrade to the so call 6.0 version to get panther... This is plain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;ridiculous and I don't think I am going to waste my money on the Dantz
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;software. I don't know if this all Dantz's fault but Apple certainly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;plays a role in the software problems. I think $60 every six months is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;wrong..... Does anyone else agree?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      I think this is what is known as an economic decision: if you can 
</I>&gt;<i> get something free or cheaper that gets the job done as well as you 
</I>&gt;<i> need it done, agreed. If not, and your data/operating environment is 
</I>&gt;<i> worth more than $60 every six months to preserve, no. A user's 
</I>&gt;<i> experience and comfort level with shell commands and cron jobs comes 
</I>&gt;<i> into the decision, as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      A lot of the changes Dantz has made in going from 5.1 -&gt; 6.0 are 
</I>&gt;<i> Panther-related, many are the result of user feedback, and many are 
</I>&gt;<i> the result of users' complaints that the Mac version couldn't do what 
</I>&gt;<i> the Windows one could, and where was Dantz's loyalty to the folks who 
</I>&gt;<i> sustained them for so many years, anyway? Such changes cost money: 
</I>&gt;<i> you pay programmers, you run beta test programs, you advertise the 
</I>&gt;<i> new features, you even (once a year?) print new packaging and 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Is it worth it to me? On systems we use as backup servers for 
</I>&gt;<i> several machines, yes (even though I gag at the prices for Workgroup 
</I>&gt;<i> Backup and [aargh] Server Backup) --- the work preserved is worth 
</I>&gt;<i> much more, to us. On standalone servers to which we can attach 
</I>&gt;<i> external FireWire drives or arrays, no, because we can use the shell 
</I>&gt;<i> command 'ditto' to create a bootable image of the boot drive every 
</I>&gt;<i> night, and we're less concerned with the ancient history of the drive 
</I>&gt;<i> than its current state. Likewise, on servers serving data archives 
</I>&gt;<i> whose contents (on a percentage basis) change slowly, ditto is more 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate than Retrospect, and a lot faster. (FWIW, Carbon Copy 
</I>&gt;<i> Cloner is a GUI front end for ditto, but really for 10.2 and earlier 
</I>&gt;<i> --- it used not to be possible to clone the entire disk in a single 
</I>&gt;<i> command line, particularly if you added new, top-level directories, 
</I>&gt;<i> but it is in 10.3). For laptops, we like products such as CMS's ABS 
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, which perform an incremental backup as soon as you attach the 
</I>&gt;<i> FireWire cable. YM, of course, MV.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      For a home/small office user unused to unix shell commands, 
</I>&gt;<i> though, Retrospect Express is a very nice solution.... once the user 
</I>&gt;<i> understands the terms in the documentation as Dantz uses them. The 
</I>&gt;<i> original poster's desirement was exactly the kind of thing at which 
</I>&gt;<i> Retrospect excels: I want to back up the whole shebang once a month, 
</I>&gt;<i> and my working files every night --- especially when you consider 
</I>&gt;<i> Retrospect's capability for allowing the user to go back to a 
</I>&gt;<i> snapshot on any date on which a backup was performed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Sorry for the length of the rant.
