<PRE>I have both a 600mHz iBook and a new 12&quot; PBG4 (1gHz, combo drive). I 
find the build quality on the PBG4 to be excellent, at least as good as 
the 800mHz TiBook that it replaced. It doesn't get very hot (much less 
than the 867mHz 12&quot; PBG4, I tried one of those too). That said, I've 
never had any problems with my 12&quot; iBook at all.

The &quot;video hack&quot; to get external monitor support beyond mirroring on 
the iBook works on most 700-900mHz G3 iBooks. I don't know if it works 
on the new G4s.

I'm very happy with my PBG4, and I plan to keep it for a quite a while. 
When my original warranty gets close to expiring, I'll likely get 
AppleCare. You can't be too careful. Feel free to ask any other 
questions, and I'll do my best to help.
