<PRE>i think the original idea was someone trying to determine the best way 
to transfer files from school to home and back. yes, cd is what shannon 
originally mentioned, but a cd-r/rw isnt the only way of fulfilling the 
need she spoke of:

&gt;<i> Is there a way that I can burn a single data CD over a period of time 
</I>&gt;<i> using both a Mac a a PC without having to reformat it every time I 
</I>&gt;<i> need to burn more data?
</I>
so others were simply supplying other options that she might not know 
about. heck, you say not to spend money when it is not necessary, but 
then offer her option as buying a $100 piece of software...? without 
toast it is true, this cannot be done (or without another commercial 
burning application) as the os x burning software only allows 1 burn 
per cd-r.

with toast, tracker is correct, burning iso 9960 format on a cd-r 
WITHOUT &quot;closing the disc&quot; (but &quot;closing the session&quot;) will allow 
multiple writes between macs and pcs. but i still think what would work 
better would be a random read/write drive such as flash memory, or your 
zip disk. (with proper compression, sizing, 100 MB should be a decent 
size for director projects-all but my final piece were below 100 MB in 
the classes i took on director/multimedia production) and i would 
actually use 2 forms of media, just for extra special backup. burn a cd 
and use zip/flash) it sucks losing 8 weeks worth of work due to 
corrupted media =(

shannon-say hello to the rochester winter for me! i spent four years up 
there-2 across the street from MCC at rustic village...
