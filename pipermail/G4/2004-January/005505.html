It was meant exactly as it sounds; whether it sounds to you the way it 
sounds to me, that's a different issue.

&gt;<i> I had performed backups for years on Digital OpenVMS systems before I

Any documentation for an unfamiliar complex tool will be at first 
difficult. The comparison to driving a car is -- of course, IMHO -- 
apt. Forget that you're an American, and therefore you were familiar 
with cars even before you could walk. For a great many people in ROW 
(the rest of the world), cars are not at all familiar, and for someone 
from rural China (or, like me, from a less-than-privileged background 
in Eastern Europe) something as simple as driving to the supermarket 
might be a daunting task.

&gt;<i> (In my case, familiar terms were used in an unfamiliar, and even 
</I>&gt;<i> counterintuitive way....since, as Sir Peter Medawar once put it, &quot;All 
</I>&gt;<i> intuition is based on experience.&quot;) If you have none, the 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation may be so much gibberish.
</I>
Not necessarily. It seems to me you assume something is either 
'cryptic' or 'intuitive'. But that is not so. For instance, compare 
Chaucer's lines

&quot;Whan that Aprille with hise shoures sote/The droghte of March hath 
perced to the rote [...]&quot;

to e.e. cummings'

&quot;spring is like a perhaps hand/(which comes carefully/out of 
Nowhere)arranging/a window [...]&quot;

I find Chaucer difficult but not cryptic. I don't need a dictionary for 
cummings -- but I find him cryptic, to say the least. Retrospect's 
manual is well written; it's difficult -- if one is not familiar with 
its concepts -- but not cryptic. Settle down with it as you would 
settle with any manual or textbook and you're in business pretty soon.

&gt;<i>  Is it worth it to me? On systems we use as backup servers for several 
</I>&gt;<i> machines, yes (even though I gag at the prices for Workgroup Backup 
</I>&gt;<i> and [aargh] Server Backup) --- the work preserved is worth much more, 
</I>&gt;<i> to us.
</I>
[...]

&gt;<i> For a home/small office user unused to unix shell commands, though, 
</I>&gt;<i> Retrospect Express is a very nice solution.... once the user 
</I>&gt;<i> understands the terms in the documentation as Dantz uses them.
</I>
This -- and several other posts about SilverKeeper or CCC -- seem to me 
to be a different issue. Not, &quot;How to use Retrospect&quot;, but &quot;Is 
Retrospect the best backup tool for me?&quot; or &quot;What's a good back up tool 
for the Mac?&quot;, to which, of course, there will be different answers.
