<PRE>Wilton, I was away from the list for a couple days updating my 
daughter's laptop. Not sure what your execution errors indicate. 
Check the log window and see what it indicates as the errors, then 
consult ECM's online FAQ. Calling them costs money unless you have 
the latest version of Retrospect. And even then the calls are limited 
according to your purchase plan. Keeping up to date with Retrospect 
is a another whole story, is expensive and subject of much gnashing 
and wailing on the on-line forums.

Two times I have received execution errors were when, 1) I had an 
grunged file, back under Mac OS9 or, 2) was not using the version of 
Retrospect compatible with the OS version.

In the case of grunged files. I used Disk Warrior to create a new 
directory then repeated the backup and all was fine. Under OS 10.4 I 
would still use DiskWarrior to repair the directory and then TechTool 
Pro 4 to optimize the disk. Takes a long time but seems to speed up 
disk operation. If you don't have those utilities, use The Apple Disk 
Utility that came with Tiger verify the drive, then booting from the 
System disk, use Disk Utility to repair the disk.

If the problem is the version of Retrospect you are using then you 
will have to upgrade to Retrospect Backup 6.1, or use another program 
such as Disk Utility or Carbon Copy Cloner 2.3 to clone your disk to 
the back up drive. You will not be able to incrementally backup 
easily but will have a faithful archive copy which you can recover 
what you need.

&gt;<i>Hello Michael,
</I>&gt;<i>    I'm asking a question again. I asked it before but you may have missed it.
</I>&gt;<i>When I completred the backup, I was left with a note that said &quot;14 
</I>&gt;<i>execution errors&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>What should I do at this point?
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Wilton

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Wilton, open Retrospect ExpressX as you did before. At the main 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>window select the &quot;Backup&quot; button. Then select the Destinaion 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Button. You will then see a window asking which Backup Set you 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>want to use. Select &quot;New&quot;. That will bring you to a window titled 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;Backup Set Creation&quot;. Set the file type selection from &quot;Removable 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Disk&quot; to &quot;File&quot;. The next window will ask you where you want to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>save that file. Select your external hard drive, and that should 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>do it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I found that if you backed out of the program at that stage, it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>will still be set to &quot;File&quot; the next time.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Good Luck.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Thanks a lot Mchael. Your instructions worked perfectly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>When everything was completed I was left with a note that said &quot;14 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>execution errors?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Do i do anything?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Thanks
