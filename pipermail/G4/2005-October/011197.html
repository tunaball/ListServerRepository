Jim, if you have an OHM meter one thing that you might want to try is:

***** Caution *****
You will need a low voltage battery operated OHM meter because an AC 
powered meter might cause you more trouble than you already have.
*******************

1. First unplug your platform from the AC source and obtain a grounding 
strap that you will connect to the platforms chassis ground.

2. Second unplug the PS and measure between each of the PS connector 
wires, and chassis ground. The reason being that a component may have 
shorted out, or a wire that was being pinched has finally had the 
insulation separated and a chassis short has developed. The problem 
here is that once you have opened the chassis the pinch point may have 
been eliminated. Therefore you should do a through visual inspection, 
looking for wires that look like they may have been pinched or the 
possibility of some small piece of wire that may have found it's way 
onto the Mobo.

2. Second is to measure between each of the PS connector wires (i.e. 
between the 1st wire, then between the 1st and the 3rd, then between 
the 1st and the 4th etc. Then repeat starting between the 2nd and the 
3rd, then the 2nd and the 4th etc., until you have checked for a short 
between all of the leads. You can do this towards the PS and towards 
the Mobo.

Once you have assured yourself that there isn't a dead short between 
any of the PS leads you can proceed with replacing the fuse, if the is 
to be your first choice or with the replacement of the PS.

As for the fuse &quot;250V 8A 51S&quot; I think that the 51S stands for the time 
delay before failure. However remember that fuses are not a precise 
device. I have seen fuse failure just because it was time to fail. Is 
the fuse just separated or does it look like it had a catastrophic 
failure, i.e. is there a burned or exploded look to the fuse?

My choice would be to measure the PS wires and then replace the fuse. 
If the fuse blows again, then replace the PS.
