<PRE>I hate when people post at the bottom of the message, it means I  
actually have to scroll down to read it but here are the answers to  
your questions (which are at the bottom):
1:  No your email address would have to change unless you have a .mac  
account like a lot of us do or gmail or hotmail or whatevermail,  
otherwise you're going to be <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/g4.html">someuser at comcast.com</A> or  
<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/g4.html">someuser at adelphia.net</A> or <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/g4.html">someuser at bellsouth.net</A> or whatever.
2:  DSL is through your Phone Company or whatever company has  
contracted with your local 'mini-bell' to use their lines like  
verizon, aol and a few other broadband providers do.  If you sign up  
for cable, it comes to your house the same way it does for your cable  
TV.  Most come with self-installation kits.  And they're really  
easy.  They come with step by step instructions with pictures....they  
assume that most people are idiots (hmmmm, I wonder where they get  
that idea, I know, they are!).
3:  It connects to your computer with either a DSL Modem with DSL  
(comes in the self install kit) and connects to the network  
connection on the back (you do have a Mac, right?....because some  
PC's don't have them, you have to go buy a PCI card...Macs have a  
network port built in (have had for years).  If you order Cable, you  
use a Cable Modem, also comes in the cable company's self install  
kit, it ALSO connects the same way to the network port.  I forgot to  
say that all of the self install kits contain all of the things that  
you will need....modem, cables, phone line adapters (if you get DSL),  
everything.

Oh, on rare occasions, the cable companies have been known to have to  
make an appointment to come to your house for installation if you  
don't have cable already.....say you have Directv or Dish Network or  
(GASP) an antenna.  With DSL, if your phone line qualifies, they just  
send you the self install kit and you're done.

Based on some of your questions, you DID check to see that you have  
broadband available in your area?  If you live out in the middle of  
nowhere, you might not be able to get any broadband service.
