<PRE>Thanks to all who have helped so far. My friend doesn't know a lot 
about Macs but does know Unix pretty well. he's already &quot;hacked&quot; into 
the system which is where I got the info posted earlier. It's actually 
his wife's computer so we're already third-hand here. She has the 
original start up disk and he tried booting from that and it still 
froze. We think it's pinned somewhere around those lines I posted 
earlier: about block counts and key lengths. He doesn't have any disk 
utilities but the IT guys at her school tried Disk Warrior and couldn't 
repair it. He actually got as far as seeing that it's a Toshiba disk 
drive in the Powerbook when he tried to boot from the restore disk but 
it still hung on him. Like I say, he lives an hour away so if we all 
don't help him long distance, he's going to drive over this weekend and 
I'm going to try Tech Tool and maybe Norton Utilities. Any other ideas, 
keep 'em coming but thanks for everything so far. I knew I'd come to 
the right place.

1. panic(cpu0): 0x300 - Data Access

2. panic: We are hanging here.

3. Incorrect block count for filesystem.log
It should be 15987 instead of 15988 (---or is it  file 
system.log---probably just one word.)

4. Invalid key length (4, 9807)

5. Volume check failed

6. Warning: blocks on volume MacIntosch HD not allocated
