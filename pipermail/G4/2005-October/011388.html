<PRE>I am registered but sent this note via another SMTP server.  I hope it 
isn't duplicated but it has not appeared.

Yeah, I have no mac experience.

25 years with PC's and I know 'em inside out.

I bought my first machine this week on ebay.

Seems like a nice &quot;start&quot;?

Apple PowerMac 400 MHz G4

512 MB RAM (4x128MB)
Rage 128 PRO (16 MB)
20 GB Hard Drive &lt;---------------------Too small
CD ROM/DVD ROM

Plus:
Internal Zip 100 Drive &lt;---------------It's going..........
Keyboad and Mouse (heavily used with visible wear but fully functional)

Mac OS X (Version 10.3.9) including:
iPhoto
iTunes
iMovie
iCal
This is the Gigabit Ethernet Model with white power button and copyright 
2000.
---------------

So?

It's confusing finding the &quot;specs&quot; for my &quot;model&quot;.
Oh I found them?  Many, many different specs!
The &quot;G4 Gigabit Ethernet&quot; has a bunch of  specs. The machine will be 
here in a couple of days...I guess I'll know the other details then.

My only concerns regard adding hardware/software &amp; the current OS.

1. What do I &quot;need&quot; to know in order to know if an app or drive 
or...will work.
(Yeah, the 20gig drive is not enogh - But, I can go &quot;off the shelf&quot; with 
a Western Digital or any third party HD?)
Plus:
I have a six month old Hitachi CD-RW? [Ht-DT-ST CD-RW GCE-8483B]
I'd like to slde it in? I was told it would be as easy as opening the 
drawer, removing the faceplate and replacing the CD-ROM/DVD ROM (I'd 
prefer dumping the Zip?)

2. I'm glad it has been upgraded to 10.3.9 as I'd prefer using Toast 7. 
  However? I won't be receiving a disc for the OS.  A PC person never 
has an OS disc out of reach!  As I am the &quot;owner&quot; is there a way to get 
a copy of the OS?  It may not matter to an Apple owner - - I'd be more 
secure with the OS on a disc!

2a.  When I add the larger HD, do you recommend I keep the 20 gig drive? 
  Is &quot;age&quot; any concern?
It isn't a lot of &quot;space&quot; I'm keeping!
As I always have my OS in a partition of its own, even if the OS &quot;stays&quot; 
on the original HD I like to give it a 10 gig of space of it;s own?
Any thoughts on 2a!?

Thanks

[Oh, I've heard from two crowds:]
1. Install Tiger, now!
&amp;
2. You don't have the juice for Tiger (especially, video)

See!?

I need this list!

Michael
