&gt;<i> &quot;GigaDesign comments on 1.7GHz 7447A Upgrade performance (vs 7455 
</I>&gt;<i> upgrades w/L3 cache) - (from a reader mail last night)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;On a discreet page, Giga designs admits that the 1.73GHz 7447 
</I>&gt;<i> upgrades are no faster than a 1.467GHz 7455. It seems that the lack of 
</I>&gt;<i> level 3 cache offsets the 18% clock increase.
</I>&gt;<i>     The new chips, however, do draw less power. (much less)
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://www.gigadesigns.com/newsMDD7447.html">http://www.gigadesigns.com/newsMDD7447.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>     -Tyler W. &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Past tests with 745x CPUs/upgrades with no L3 cache (compared to the 
</I>&gt;<i> same speed upgrade w/L3) showed a big hit in performance in some tests 
</I>&gt;<i> - especially 3D gaming. Those were 256KB L2 CPUs, not 512KB like the 
</I>&gt;<i> 7447A, but I'd still prefer an upgrade with an L3 cache for older 
</I>&gt;<i> Macs. GigaDesign mentions the much lower power use (40% they say) of 
</I>&gt;<i> the 7447 as a plus for Cube owners and earlier model AGP Tower owners 
</I>&gt;<i> that didn't have very high wattage Power Supplies. (The Cube's power 
</I>&gt;<i> brick for instance is rated for 208W (28VDC), and as mentioned in past 
</I>&gt;<i> full reviews here of Cube upgrades - if you're running an ADC display 
</I>&gt;<i> that also consumes a portion of that power budget and in some cases 
</I>&gt;<i> has caused failures/damage when upgrades were used w/ADC monitors - in 
</I>&gt;<i> particular the 17in CRT ADC display, which uses about half of the 
</I>&gt;<i> total power budget. I've seen some failed VRM boards reported also 
</I>&gt;<i> with heavily upgraded Cubes and they're expensive to replace typically 
</I>&gt;<i> - over $200 apple parts list price last i checked a couple of years 
</I>&gt;<i> ago. Although more robust VRM boards were originally promised by two 
</I>&gt;<i> companies, to date they were never sold. I remember someone using a 
</I>&gt;<i> 2nd Cube Power brick for ADC power IIRC, but most owners are not going 
</I>&gt;<i> to do those sorts of mods.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As mentioned in Tuesday's news (when Sonnet's and GigaDesign's 7447 
</I>&gt;<i> upgrades were announced), Sonnet's ST G4 product page has a link to a 
</I>&gt;<i> benchmarks page but it has no comparison results (to date) with the 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.7GHz upgrade. (If any readers buy one of these please post a report 
</I>&gt;<i> in the database here. Running some before/after apps tests would also 
</I>&gt;<i> be nice to include - see examples in reviews on the CPU upgrade 
</I>&gt;<i> reviews page here. Thanks.)&quot;
</I>
I went to the page linked above and it seems that you do not get a 
great deal of extra speed because it has no Level 3 cache. This is 
pretty consistent with my experience, as my G4 eMac 1 GHz which has no 
Level 3 cash is not as fast as my 933 MHz Quicksilver 2002, which does 
have L3 Cache.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, one of these 1.73 upgrades is a pair of over-clocked 1.43GHz
