<PRE>Gregory:

It seems it would be a good service if you posted the problem and the 
fix to the Apple forum if you have not already done it.

Apple posted the 10.3.6 update on 11/5/04.  You say Raedon's patch for 
ATI software was in early November.  Perhaps that was in direct 
response to 10.3.6.  There could have been problems on your G4 after 
10.3.6 which you did not notice until Apple's security update made 
things apparent.

Apple sets standards for coding software which Raedon may not have 
followed until after the 10.3.6 updater.  Apple does not test its 
software against the thousands of possible third party modifications to 
its computers.  That is left up to us in realtime.  A lot of 
speculation here.

But the hard question you raise is what about the people who would not 
know how to troubleshoot such a problem.  I have no clue what to look 
for in Console mode, which I understand is also called Single User mode 
in Terminal.  For folks like me, I guess the lesson is to check the web 
sites of all manufacturers of third part equipment and software 
installed on our Macs after any experience like yours.
