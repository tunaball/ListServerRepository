<PRE>When you say you downloaded &quot;it&quot;, was it the Displays or the ROM 
Updater?  If it was the ROM Updater, try using the &quot;Custom&quot; option to 
back up to your original ROM.  I also had problems with the new ROM 
using my G4/500 with TV OUT - it would not wake up and remember to look 
for the S-Video, so I dropped back to the original 126 version ROM 
which after also backing ATI Displays to 4.2 seemed to restore the 
system to some level of normalacy (though I do believe that the 10.3.6+ 
ATI drivers are slower than the 10.3.5 versions - DVD playback seems to 
be choppy since that upgrade).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apple sets standards for coding software which Raedon may not have

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But the hard question you raise is what about the people who would
