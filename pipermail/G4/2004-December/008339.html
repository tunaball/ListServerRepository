How long had it worked after upgrading from __what?__ to Panther 10.3.6.
Confirm that all you did after the upgrade was to try to use it.
How did it &quot;quit?&quot; Did you shut it down and when rebooting, it gave a 
tone, but that's it?
In other words, this appeared after a reboot?
Do you normally turn the CP off after you're done for the day, and it 
wouldn't come back up?
No question mark on the screen? Or no screen at all? No frowning Mac icon?
No further application upgrades, or similar?
I can't help, but would think the answer to the above questions will assist
anyone who might know what's wrong.
