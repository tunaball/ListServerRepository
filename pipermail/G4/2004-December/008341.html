<PRE>No answers from me, but a few questions to narrow down the 
possibilities for the real experts.

&quot;lots of other stuff&quot;  eh?  Do you have external USB or Firewire 
devices other than the monitor and keyboard?  Unplug them, including 
the printer, till things get straight.

That's a &quot;dual boot&quot; machine.  Do you have OS 9 installed?  Have you 
tried to start up in OS 9?

Do you have the original Apple CDs for that machine?  You should have 
received them where you bought the QS.  Or do you have retail OS 9 or 
OS X CDs?  Or do you have utility CDs such as TechTools Pro, 
DiskWarrior, or even Norton Utilities from which to attempt start up?
