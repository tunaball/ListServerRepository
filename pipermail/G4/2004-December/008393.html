<PRE>Three days ago, I downloaded a NEAT freebie: USBMonitor.  It shows 
you what's plugged in (and working) every time you change something. 
There is also a similar thing that costs US $9, &quot;Peripheral Vision,&quot; 
and it monitors USB, Firewire, etc.  So fat, I have only run the 
freebie:

README - USB Monitor version 1.1.1

What is USB Monitor?

Have you ever plugged in a USB device only to be underwhelmed by the 
reaction of OS X? It can be very confusing when the system seems to 
pay no attention to what's just been plugged in - did it even notice? 
We often brought up Apple System Profiler to check if the device got 
registered. USB Monitor eliminates the guess work. It pops up a 
little window and provides the name of the device that's just been 
plugged in (or unplugged). The window follows the visual style of the 
transparent windows for volume and eject.

Note we have another product called &quot;Peripheral Vision&quot; that extends 
this functionality to FireWire, Bluetooth and Network Link Status. It 
also adds audio alerts.

What's New in 1.1.1

* Fixed a memory leak.

Requirements

Mac OS X 10.1 and above.

Installation

Just drag the USB Monitor icon to the Utilities directory of your 
choice or run it in place from the disk image. If you have already 
installed USB Monitor you will need to quit it before copying the new 
version. To quit the running app use the &quot;Process Viewer&quot; utility.

Using USB Monitor

Once started USB Monitor pops up a status window showing the 
currently connected devices. No icon is added to the dock as this 
program is intended to run in the background and not be interacted 
with by the user.

The best way to configure USB Monitor is to add it to your Login 
Items in your Login Preferences. That way it will always be running 
when you're logged in.

(If you have a need to stop the USB Monitor app use the Process 
Viewer utility and stop it from there.)

Known Issues

None at this time.

Bugs, Issues etc.

None.

This software is completely without warranty.
Please contact us with any bugs, feature requests, issues etc.
