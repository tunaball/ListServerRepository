I think there's probably a reason there's nothing around. Cooling Macs 
is trivial, they don't have heat problems (with the exception of the G4 
Cube). The reason anything pre-7450 even had a temperature sensor was 
because they were using FPGA's to simulate the CPU in development. That 
was a point where changing chip architecture actually helped reduce 
heat! It was merely in production machines for a convenience factor; 
meaning, it was more or less a cooking thermometer :).

CJ,

I appreciate the information that you added, but am a little confused 
by your nomenclature. Not all of us are &quot;Wizards&quot; at the Mac and do not 
know all the acronyms. Perhaps you could expand on the information that 
you included so I could see where you are going? Ie: FPGA and pre-7450 
are not terms that I have encountered yet in my readings except for 
your posting.

Thanks in advance,
Ron
