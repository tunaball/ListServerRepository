You misunderstood. By G4 1Ghz models I was talking about the processor 
itself. I believe it was the 7450 and later that didn't have the 
feature. The three servers here that have a G4 model prior to 7450 do 
have temperature sensors. The remaining 8 that are post 7450 do not. 
That should give you a good idea of what I mean, considering the 1Ghz 
model was the 7455 (with the exception of the hundred or so 7450 chips 
that made it into some quicksilver machines).

&gt;<i> It would be nice to see a list of the G4 machines that DO have 
</I>&gt;<i> temperature sensors rather than be told that Apple didn't put sensors 
</I>&gt;<i> in &quot;a good portion of the 1GHz models... They were deemed to

</I>&gt;<i> it together for posting?
</I>
He never asked a specific question, I was merely giving the information 
I knew was true. Why are you so hostile over such a trivial matter?

&gt;<i> If a true temperature monitor/indicator is the subject of discussion, 
</I>&gt;<i> that is a horse of a different color. The installation of sensors and 
</I>&gt;<i> temperature control software was to reduce a heat problem, not to

</I>
I think there's probably a reason there's nothing around. Cooling Macs 
is trivial, they don't have heat problems (with the exception of the G4 
Cube). The reason anything pre-7450 even had a temperature sensor was 
because they were using FPGA's to simulate the CPU in development. That 
was a point where changing chip architecture actually helped reduce 
heat! It was merely in production machines for a convenience factor; 
meaning, it was more or less a cooking thermometer :).
