There are many makes.  OSX is kinda picky, so be sure to buy at a 
company with a liberal, lifetime return policy.
Generic Ram tends to be cheaper and have more problems than Name Brand.

MacSolutions, OWC, SmallDog, RamSeeker (will find lowest price)

2100 is your RAM but the 2700 will run at the same speed as the 2100 
stuff.  They did this because they could stop producing the 2100 - less 
different manufacturing equals more efficiency equals cheaper and more 
profit.

I found that I liked my original RAM more than the newer, it was more 
reliable.  I had a Sawtooth with PC100 and then PC133 came along and 
the 100 was very hard to find.  The 2100 and 2700 I have no experience 
with.

I also found that mixing the two RAMs in the same machine was not as 
good as all one kind - I had two machines, so one was pc100 only and 
the other was pc133 only.  This worked well for both machines.
