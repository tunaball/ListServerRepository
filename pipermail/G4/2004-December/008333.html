Unfortunately, the Keychain has never worked properly. It will offer 
to remember some, but not all. If it can't keep track of ALL of them 
then it is worthless to me.

Personally, the password demands of OS X border on paranoia. I can 
see the reason if the computer is SHARED with other users, but if 
there is only ONE user, then there should be a way to turn off all 
but the root &amp; admin ones. Since I am the only user, I suppose that I 
could &quot;standardize&quot; on three:
root, admin, everything else.
