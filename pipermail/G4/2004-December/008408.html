<PRE>As a side note, after reading the original mail here, I decided I 
NEEDED to update my Radeon in my G4 1.25 system.
So, off I went, downloaded and installed it.
All of a sudden, my system is DOG slow! My G3 Beige is running circles 
around this system. I am not sure now what to do about this.
I did look in Console, but as you point out here, I have no idea what I 
am looking for!
Any ideas?
Thanks,
John
