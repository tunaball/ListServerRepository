<PRE>Thanks Al for that excellent suggestion. I will indeed post this up on 
the forum. Posting it here was also done primarily as a service to 
others who might be facing the same issue. To be honest I don't know 
what most of the logs written in Console mean. Somewhere along the line 
I learned to look there if you are experiencing crashes or problems. 
Some of it is in a peculiar type of plain English, at least clear 
enough so that I could see that major problems were surrounding ATI 
software every any application had to do anything at all. I basically 
do check for updates and patches on all non Apple software on a regular 
basis. But I know people like my mom with her iMac has no interest in 
doing anything like that. She is not alone. Then again most people I 
know use Windows and just accept the unacceptable daily in a blissful 
sort of ignorance.

</I>&gt;<i> Apple sets standards for coding software which Raedon may not have

</I>&gt;<i> software against the thousands of possible third party modifications 
</I>&gt;<i> to its computers.  That is left up to us in realtime.  A lot of 
</I>&gt;<i> speculation here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the hard question you raise is what about the people who would not 
</I>&gt;<i> know how to troubleshoot such a problem.  I have no clue what to look 
</I>&gt;<i> for in Console mode, which I understand is also called Single User 
</I>&gt;<i> mode in Terminal.  For folks like me, I guess the lesson is to check 
</I>&gt;<i> the web sites of all manufacturers of third part equipment and 
</I>&gt;<i> software installed on our Macs after any experience like yours.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> games I have were impossible. Mail was acting strange. I thought I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had a virus. But no. So I checked in Console and saw LOTS of problems 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with ATI software not responding properly. I have a Radeon 8500 Mac 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> edition which I installed about 2 years ago and never had any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems. I downloaded their latest update patch last night, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restarted and all was back to even better than normal. Everything is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> faster than ever (knocking on wood) and I am pretty happy. So, why 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would this happen? What would I have done if I didn't know enough to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> look in console and known that I had that card, etc? Most people I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know don't know anything about that stuff. The update to the ATI 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software was put out in early November, well before the Apple 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> security update that apparently caused problems with my video. And it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be installed on any system above 10.2.8. Has anybody else had any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience like this? I am grateful for the easy fix. But I wonder 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why it happened.
