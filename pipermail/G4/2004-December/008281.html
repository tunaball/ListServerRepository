I'm upgrading the optical drive in my G4 Quicksilver tower. Is there a 
good online resource with instructions? I'm sure it's probably 
dead-simple, but thought I'd check with the list before I break out the 
screwdriver. Also, is the optical drive typically set to master or 
slave?

Do you feel comfortable with taking a screwdriver to your Mac? Have you 
ever removed the original drive? If not, go to xlr8yourmac.com to learn 
how to remove and install drives.

It is a simple swap-out as long as you have a new drive that is Mac 
compatible. That is important so you can maintain the ability to boot 
from the drive using OS installation and/or utility program CDs such as 
TechTool Pro or DiskWarrior.

I always check to make sure that the CD/DVD drive is set to master on 
the bus that it is plugged in. That way, I avoid master/slave conflicts 
with any other drive on the same bus. Other people don't use master for 
the CD/DVD, so I guess it's a matter of personal choice. As long as you 
identify the drives without duplication, you shouldn't have any 
problem.

You will enjoy the upgrade after you accomplish it.
