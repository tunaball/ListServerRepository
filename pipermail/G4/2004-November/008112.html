I'm actually a Apple Service Technician, and I have had a good look

the motherboard.  None of the screws have been touched ie there are no
screwdriver marks on the screw heads.  It would have stood out if the 
cpu
baard had been removed.

I'm not a certified AST, but I take enough care that I don't leave 
buggered up screw heads in the machines that I work on. Not having 
marks on the screws doesn't necessarily mean that the cpu had not been 
changed out.

Now, if Apple were to use a thread-lock liquid/sealer like BMW does, it 
would show up in a New York minute that someone had been tinkering with 
the insides of the machine and you would have reason to suspect 
evil-doings. In their thriftiness, Apple leaves out this step in the 
manufacturing and makes it possible to change all sorts of equipment 
without leaving a trace.

I have no knowledge of units leaving the factory with incorrect 
labeling (except for a few &quot;500 MHz&quot; machines that were actually only 
450 MHz because of physical limits on the mobo), so it seems to me that 
there was indeed a change of processor chips at some time in the past 
by a previous owner.

It is labeled correctly or incorrectly, which choice you make is up to 
you, but I would go with the original label and look for the reason for 
the inconsistency.
