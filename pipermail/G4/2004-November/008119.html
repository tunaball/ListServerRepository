I've poked my head in more machines than I wish to remember, and normally I
can tell.  For some reason the tension on the screws seems the same each
time from the factory, yet I can feel a different tension if someone has had
it apart before.

In saying that, on closer inspection this evening with a torch, I noticed
one of the screw heads has got marks on it, like someone has used the wrong
sized screwdriver. I just emailled the guy I bought it from for some more
info.

Unfortunately I'm starting to think the same thing :-(

</I>

Everything else on the machine points to the label being correct, as from
memory the 1Ghz machine in that series was a single processor (and this is
definitely a DP).  Even the serial number check with Apple says its a
1.25Ghz.

I'm quite happy for it to be 1Ghz, as that is what I was told it was and
paid for.  My only concern is the machine is still under warranty for
another 2 years and if the processors fry, Apple will ask questions when the
parts are sent back (the processor board clearly says 1Ghz Dual Processor).

Thanks for your input!

Seeya

Rod!
