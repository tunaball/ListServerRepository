<PRE>Should be fine.  I have had good luck with Maxtor and Seagate.  I try to never pay more than $.50/gig, but that takes some patience.

Hello,
 
Thanks!
 
Question... I see a western digital drive on sale... 80 gig... 7200 rpm eide
 
Do you think it would be as good/same as the maxtor?
 
Thanks...

    The Maxtor should work. I have had two store-bought Maxtors in my Yikes! 400 and they both worked out of the box, with no special requirements.

    YMMV,

    Hello,

    I think my hard drive is dying. I have a G4 400 mhz... 320 ram 20 gig hard drive.

    The drive is clicking when I'm working on it. The longer the machine is on the worse it gets!

    I've looked at getting a new hard drive. Will it be easy for me to install a new drive myself? Do i have the correct stuff to plug the new one into the G4?

    I looked at a maxtor 60 gig. It was $40 at staples. Will this work. It said G4 on the box. Is there anything specific I need to find on the box to ensure I get the right drive?

    Thanks
