<PRE>Hi:

I have a G4/667 I got back in Aug 2001.  I want to do some audio work,
i.e. digitize audio from an input-source (say, via stereo mic-jack) &amp;
write an audio-track on a CD-R (which I assume can be read by a standard
home-stereo CD player..or does it have to be CD-R compatible?).

Has anyone tried to do this?

I just noticed the G4/667 doesn't have a mic-input jack in the rear:

<A HREF="http://www.powermax.com/pdf/G4_Tower_Spec_sheet_1_01.pdf">http://www.powermax.com/pdf/G4_Tower_Spec_sheet_1_01.pdf</A>
<A HREF="http://eshop.macsales.com/Descriptions/specs/Framework.cfm?page=g4da.html&title=Power%20Macintosh%20G4%20Digital%20Audio">http://eshop.macsales.com/Descriptions/specs/Framework.cfm?page=g4da.html&amp;title=Power%20Macintosh%20G4%20Digital%20Audio</A>

&quot;Other Ports: Speaker, Headphone&quot;  (where is mic-input jack??)

My sound system is connected to &quot;Headphone&quot;, I think &quot;Speaker&quot; is
reserved for something like Apple Pro Speakers.  No microphone-input
jack!!  (I will note there was a &quot;Digital Audio&quot; version of the G4
Mac..maybe it has one??)

I went into &quot;Sound Control Panel&quot;, &amp; the only Audio-In source was the CD
player.  I note there appears to be something like an audio-microphone
in the front of the G4 (? that round thing with a lot of holes).

So, how do I get sound into the G4 to be digitized? (via SimpleSound, I
guess).  The online help for my G4 makes reference to a microphone-input
jack (or a USB compatible microphone).  But like I say, mic-input jack
doesn't seem to be there.  Am I looking at a USB microphone?  If so, can
someone recommend one?

Okay, so I digitize the music (via USB microphone) using SimpleSound,
say into a .wav file (uncompressed).  Then, I drag it into a blank CD-R
&amp; hit &quot;Burn CD&quot;.  I assume I select &quot;Standard CD&quot;, &amp; it will write an
audio track onto the CD..which will play in an anyold stereo CD player.
(or does the CD player have to be CD-R/RW compatible?).  Did I get this
right?  If there are any easier ways (using shareware or bought
programs), let me know..

I just got a Panasonic SC-EN7 bookshelf stereo system ($85), which is
CD-R/RW &amp; MP3 compatible.  I've been using an older Emerson
Soundstyle2000 (don't know if it's CD-R compatible).

I have an old 8500/120 (w/G4 upgrade), which has audio/video in using
banana jacks.  (it's still hung around in terms of popularity &amp;
functionality, due to it's video in capability).  If the above G4
solution (requiring extra $$ using USB microphone) is a hassle, maybe I
can use my 8500.  It has an external Yamahd CD recorder.  I assume Toast
can burn a .wav file onto the CD, right?

Sorry about all the naive questions about audio..  I'm a newbie when it
comes to audio.

If anyone knows any audio oriented sites for Apple computers, I'd
appreciate any links..
