<PRE>To the best of my understanding, in the USA, it is legal via the Fair 
Use doctrine to make backups of your media, e.g. record -&gt; cassette, CD 
-&gt; CD or hard disk, etc. Because of the Digital Millennium Copyright 
Act [DMCA], however, It is illegal to circumvent digital protection 
measures like CSS on DVDs. So while it is legal to make a backup of 
your DVD, it is illegal to decode it for that purpose. How's that for a 
crafty piece of lobbying by Disney, the RIAA and the MPAA.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See the &quot;Pioneer 107 and DVD media question&quot; thread in the archive. It 
</I>&gt;<i> addresses some of these issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question is one of copyright, and copyright law differs and is 
</I>&gt;<i> interpreted differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. What is 
</I>&gt;<i> legal in one country, may be illegal in another (e.g., copying an 
</I>&gt;<i> audio CD for personal use is legal in Canada but illegal in the US). 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, it's an issue which to some extent is still sub judice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In law, not only the act, but also intent counts. Since one can't 
</I>&gt;<i> argue any intent in extracting data from a copyright-protected DVD 
</I>&gt;<i> other than breaking the copyright, that's where it becomes illegal. 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, copying a DVD illegally and possessing an illegal copy of 
</I>&gt;<i> a DVD are two different issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is it legal to burn a backup copy if you own the original (either CD 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or DVD)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In many jurisdictions, no. There is no &quot;backup&quot; of copyrighted 
</I>&gt;<i> artistic work; the notion applies only to software. With respect to 
</I>&gt;<i> software, it depends on the EULA (end-user legal agreement) -- some 
</I>&gt;<i> permit a single backup copy, others don't permit any backup, and some 
</I>&gt;<i> do not mention it, which may be interpreted to mean that they permit a 
</I>&gt;<i> single backup copy as a procedure established by custom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, in some jurisdictions it may be. E.g., in Canada, copyright 
</I>&gt;<i> law allows making a copy of an audio CD, even if one doesn't own the 
</I>&gt;<i> original, as long as its for personal use exclusively; but copying 
</I>&gt;<i> DVDs, even for personal use, is illegal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is it illegal to capture parts of CDs or DVDs, modify them, then 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incorporate them into new and original music or video?  How much 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modification is required before a file is considered your own 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> artistic effort?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is covered by the doctrine of fair use. Again, it differs from 
</I>&gt;<i> jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and its interpretation is, again, in 
</I>&gt;<i> flux; additionally, you must distinguish between plagiarism and 
</I>&gt;<i> artistic effort. The latter may not be the former, but that doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> mean it's licence for breaking the copyright. There is no easy answer; 
</I>&gt;<i> but there is also no easy excuse for not seeking permission from the 
</I>&gt;<i> copyright holder.
