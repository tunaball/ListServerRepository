     Well, maybe; it depends on what sort of backup you want/use. If 
you use something (e.g. ditto or psync) that simply images the disk 
as it is today, all you need is the volume currently in use. If you 
use an incremental backup application (such as Retrospect), it allows 
you to access an image of however your disk looked on any backup date 
since you began backing up --- so you'll presumably need more space 
than is used on your current hard drive. How much more depends on how 
much &quot;thrash&quot; there is in your files --- do they change a lot from 
day to day, while maintaining about the same total number of blocks, 
or are they pretty much the same things --- and on whether you back 
up useless files such as browser cache files.

     And finally, a holdover from the days when disk drives were too 
expensive to be given away as prizes in Crackerjacks packages, some 
backup software will allow you to compress the backup image (in 
software, and thus with a performance hit), so you might need _less_ 
space than you use on your current drive.

     There: I made a simple answer complicated. Just like real life, 
except for politicians.
