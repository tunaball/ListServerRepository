<PRE>I'm getting senile so sometimes I don't understand all this high-tech stuff 
so good.  I'm 31 and still call my primary home entertainment center Dolby 
7-1 SurroundSound a &quot;stereo&quot;--which it is.  Easier to say also, for old 
geezers.

As you have discovered, in iTunes 4.5 Prefs you can turn on Sharing and 
access your music from any of your networked computers, whether it is 
through Ethernet, AppleTalk or Airport.  All I (we) have been saying is that 
there are some Mac users who either can't afford to spend money on the very 
latest toy OR just don't want to OR still are using machines such as 660AV 
or 840AV.

Some of us are contented with spending $10 on wire and a half hour of 
non-strenuous work to have music in the basement or in my case, my hot tub 
room and my studio.  It isn't whether one method is better--I would much 
rather have the wireless if I didn't have other priorities for my money.

Airport Express is ideal for those of us with our iTunes server located 
remotely from our primary home entertainment center (a.k.a. &quot;the stereo&quot; for 
you old timers.)

My iTunes server is upstairs on the G4/Dual 500 in the home office, 
accessible from any system on my home's WLAN.

Airport Express means that I don't have to dedicate a Wi-Fi enabled Mac to 
be plugged into the stereo.  I'll be able to sit with my TiPBG4 anywhere in 
the house and select the content to be played over the stereo.  That's 
pretty darn cool.  And I get Wi-Fi range extension as well, so I should be 
able to take my TiPBG4 down another level to my garage (where I've got a 
second set of speakers off of the stereo) and select songs from there as 
well.

My order is placed :-)

Regards,

Jim
