<PRE>I've recently acquired a G4 Dual 867 MHz MDD that came with only the original I (I think) drives. The HD has the following description (excerpted from System Profiler):

  Capacity:	57.27 GB
  Model:	IBM-IC35L060AVVA07-0
  Revision:	VA3BA52A

The optical disk is the misnamed &quot;SuperDrive&quot; -- misnamed because it should be called the &quot;Super-Slow Drive&quot;. (It's presently out of the computer while I'm working on adding another, faster drive, so I can't look it up on System Profiler.)

Anyway, I've added two Maxtor ATA133 drives (120 and 80 decimal MB) and am about to add a Lite-On CD/DVD read-and-write everything drive that reads and writes CD's at 48x (7200KB/sec) and DVD's at 16x (21600KB/sec).

I know that the machine had 3 ATA buses: ATA33, ATA66 and ATA100, each of which can handle two drives, but will, presumably, slow down if both drives are being accessed at once. I also have a Sonnet Tempo ATA133 card that I can use if it would make a substantial difference in speed.

My general question is:

What speed ATA bus (and what combination of devices and buses) will get the maximum, or nearly maximum, actual transfer rate out of the various drives?

Specific questions include:

What is the ATA speed of the IBM drive described above?
What speed of ATA bus is necessary to run the Lite-On drive at full speed?
Will an ATA133 drive run faster on an ATA133 bus from an ATA133 card than from a built-in ATA100 bus?

Any info will be appreciated.

 - Aaron

P.S. I'm running OSX 10.3.9 as it came with the computer. I'm planning to also perhaps boot into OS9.
