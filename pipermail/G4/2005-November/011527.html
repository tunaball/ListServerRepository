Your machine has two ATA interfaces: ATA66 and ATA100. Get a copy of  
MacTracker to learn more.

Unless you've got something better to do with it you might as well  
use the Sonnet. That way you can put each drive on it's own channel.


&gt;<i> My general question is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What speed ATA bus (and what combination of devices and buses) will  
</I>&gt;<i> get the maximum, or nearly maximum, actual transfer rate out of the  
</I>&gt;<i> various drives?
</I>
Put the drives you use the most on the faster interface unless you  
tend to use them at the same time as only one drive on a interface  
can be accessed at a time.


&gt;<i> Specific questions include:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the ATA speed of the IBM drive described above?
</I>
I could tell you, but it's better to teach a man to fish ... In other  
words Google is your friend.


&gt;<i> What speed of ATA bus is necessary to run the Lite-On drive at full  
</I>&gt;<i> speed?
</I>
The ATA 66. ATA 33 would be good enough though.


&gt;<i> Will an ATA133 drive run faster on an ATA133 bus from an ATA133  
</I>&gt;<i> card than from a built-in ATA100 bus?
</I>
Unlikely, and even if the difference is measureable you won't notice  
the difference.
