<PRE>UNCLE!!!!

This is a bit OT for this forum, but I'd appreciate it if you could  
give me a steer in the right direction.

I've been trying to learn a bit about BitTorrent because my favorite  
podcast TWiT (The Week in Tech)  is now available in video, but only  
if you download a copy via bittorrent. I seem to have successfully  
installed Azureus and it seems that everything downloaded fine.

  I now have a file called &quot;pxc_twit30_h264_01.mov&quot; 601MB big,  that  
is supposed to be a QuickTime file coded with H.264.  he only problem  
is that QT doesn't recognize it.  Instead, I get an &quot;ALERT&quot; window  
that says  this file is not a file that QuickTime understands (-2048).

I have spent too much time already trying to find some info that  
might help me, but each lead has been a dry hole. I found nothing at  
Apple support that could even give me a clue as to what the error is.


I am using an iMac G5 with the latest relevant software...   OSX  
10.4.3, QT 7.0.3, and the latest Java.

I'm declaring &quot;UNCLE&quot; I give!  Can some kind soul give me a lead as  
to where to look next to get this thing working?

As part of my troubleshooting scheme, I'd like to find another  
legal .mov file to download and try out, but I haven't found where  
things like that  reside. So far all the bit torrent servers I've  
looked at, seem to deal in copyrighted  files I don't want to touch.  
(despite the claims to the contrary, there seems to be an awful lot  
of pirated stuff up there.)
