I just migrated the two drives from the built-in ATA 66 to the card, and indeed they do work!

Some observations:

The ATA card does indeed now show in in Panther's System Profiler, but the drives don't show up under either ATA or SCSI! Also, Panther's Info windows don't tell you anything about what bus, etc., a volume is on. Fortunately, Disk Utility does that.

I also have another problem, but I'll start a new thread with a more descriptive title for that one.
