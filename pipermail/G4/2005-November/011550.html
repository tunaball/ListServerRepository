The two cards are a Sonnet Tempo ATA 133 card and an ixTV card. I know 
that the former should work under 10.x, if not the latter. But even a 
card that doesn't work should be seen, shouldn't it?

I installed the same card in my GBit G4 and it did not show up in 
System Profiler either. However, there was an indication that a card of 
some sort was installed in the #3 slot. It was identified with a 
cryptic code sequence that I could never get an answer for from anybody 
that I asked.

As long as it worked, I stopped worrying about it and just kept on 
going. I would attach a drive or two to the card and see if they mount 
on the desktop. Mine did, and it is a good probability that yours will 
too.
