I have been using PCs for a long time and recently was given a used 
PowerMac G4. I was able to get OSX running on it after buying a new 
hard disk.

I tried upgrading to a dual processor given to me by a friend who is a 
long time MAC user.
&#160;
The problem is that the system will not boot up. I get a message in 
four languages that says &#8220;You must restart your computer&#8230;&#8221;. Restarting 
returns the same message.
&#160;
Can anybody help me get started?

Fred,
You are experiencing a Kernel Panic, also known as a System Crash, with 
the dual processor installed. Carefully check that the dual processor 
card was properly seated during installation. Do a cold start and wait 
to see what appears.

If the problem persists and you continue to get the Kernel Panic 
window, shut down and remove the dual processor card and put back the 
original processor chip to see if that cures the problem.

If the problem window doesn't appear, you are golden and can go on 
about your business of learning how to use a Macintosh.

If the problem persists, you have some problem other than one being 
caused by the change of processor chips.

If you have the OS-X installation CD, start the G4 and immediately 
insert the CD while holding down the &quot;C&quot; key on the keyboard. When the 
startup dialogue window gets to the point of asking what type of 
installation you want, select &quot;Erase and Install&quot; to get a fresh 
installation of the operating system on your drive. After doing a fresh 
install of the OS, you can install any other programs that you want as 
long as they are Macintosh compatible and will run in OS-X.

This is the simplest way of getting your machine up and running without 
carrying any old problems forward with you. There are other 
installation methods, but it would take a longer message to describe 
them to you and the message might not be permitted on this bulletin 
board because of length.

If you have other questions, ask away. There are always people out here 
who can and are willing to help.
