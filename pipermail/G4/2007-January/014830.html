<PRE>No need to overly complicate matters.  Just get a new drive.  Say roughly 100-160 GB (all you can see without adding a new controller card will be 128 GB, but it is hard to get drives less than about 160 GB, and they are cheap, in any event--maybe $50 to $75 or so).  I am assuming that you are using OS X.  Install the new drive inside your Mac (there should be room for a second hard drive), and initialize it with DiskUtility.  Then, just download CarbonCopyCloner (donation wear) to your old drive, and clone the existing drive to the new drive--means that everything on the old drive will be on the new drive--be sure to select the preference to make the new drive bootable.  CCC fixes permissions on the original drive by default before the cloning even begins, unless you uncheck the box in its preferences.  Once that is done, you can forget about the old drive, except that some applications might require re-entering registration information in the new drive (so don't trash the old one just yet--you may need to copy some registration information over to the new drive).
