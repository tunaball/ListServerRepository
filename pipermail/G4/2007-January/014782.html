Greetings ( + )!( + )

This may be one of those instances where the device needs to be 
formatted on a WINTEL PC first before the Mac. will accept it being 
plugged in to the OS Platform. When my granddaughter got her iPod we 
initialized it on my Mac. and when she took it home it wouldn't work on 
their WINTEL. So she had to reformat the iPod on the WINTEL and loose 
all of the songs that were placed there while connected to my Mac.

After initializing the iPod on their WINTEL she was able to replace all 
of her songs and when she came back to my house the iPod would connect 
to my Mac. and everything worked just fine. She can also add songs to 
the iPod from my Mac.

So my advice would be to connect the FAST TRAX player to a WINTEL 
platform and then see if it will connect to the Mac.
