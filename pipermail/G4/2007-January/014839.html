&gt;<i> He also said that you can't always get
</I>&gt;<i> all the permissions and that my old software would not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily transfer over. IS THIS TRUE?
</I>
&lt;snip&gt;

My first Mac, (11-'05) a G4 GE had a 20Gig HD.
I added a 126Gig HD on day one. I 'cloned' all that was on the old disc 
to the new disc and didn't lose a byte.

I used SuperDuper &lt;<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/6krpz">http://tinyurl.com/6krpz</A>&gt; to clone disc0 to disk1 and 
rebooted to the 'big drive' - - [End of Story].
All was perfect. (I didn't even 'switch' the cables, left the new disc 
on the 'second cable')

A couple months later I did the same (dumped the 20Gig drive) w/another 
126Gig drive &amp; I can 'boot' to either drive (the OS takes up little room 
so I left it on the 'replacement' but boot to the slightly newer disc).
SuperD does a methodical routine from formatting before, 
checking/confirming permissions &amp; comparing during (it took a while?) 
the clone  - - - But after messing with M$ boxes for 20+ years and after 
a dozens drive swaps this was too EZ.

BTW, my motto is &quot;A drive w/any problem is replaced the next day.&quot; Fix 
it so you can dump the contents to a new disc...then run, don't walk 
away from it.
Um, no one can tell you &quot;...two more months...&quot;. because a shaky HD is 
careening down a mountain with no brakes...it's simply waiting to smack 
into something and die.

Since you can get a 128Gig (the max for your config, no doubt) for no 
more than $60? Why risk losing your data and dealing w/a re-install?
Slap yer new drive on the lonely, driveless cable, run SuperD and when 
it's done its duty, go to permissions and set the new drive to boot.
Re-boot and you won't look back.

Are there alternate apps?
Obviously!
But I was as dumb as they come w/Macs and only had to check a couple of 
boxes and say &quot;OK&quot;...
A couple hours later (after switching to start up on the new disc) I had 
a new drive &amp; 100+Gig of free space.

...if there was a cheap (free) way to slap a 300Gig drive in, I'd do it 
tonight.
