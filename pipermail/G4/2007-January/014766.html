<PRE>Bobby Wade --

Depending on how many devices the existing DSL-modem/router can
handle (some can do more than 1), and what all else it has in it
(e.g., NAT with Firewall; DHCP server; &quot;admin&quot; interface), you
might want to throw a very small amount of money at another
switch/router to sit between the DSL-modem and all the other
machines on your home LAN.  And as Harry Freeman noted, every
machine on your LAN would have independent, concurrent, access
to the internet.

3 1/2 years ago I bought a Linksys &quot;EtherFast&quot; router/switch
with 4 LAN ports.  My local CompUSA had it discounted, over-the-
counter, for $50.  It has worked flawlessly since then.  I
just did a trivial Google-search for &quot;linksys router&quot; and &quot;price&quot;
and found that NewEGG is offering the identical model now for
$7 less than I had paid, and there is an additional $10 mail-in
coupon.  The model is BEFSR41 for the 4-port unit.  (Linksys
also makes an 8-port and a wired-plus-WiFi unit, as well.)

It's kind of amazing all of what LinkSys built into that small
device.  And when I went after &quot;technical support&quot; (which I actually
never really needed -- it is almost entirely &quot;plug-and-play&quot; since
they got the usual default settings perfect for a home-LAN)
I was extremly impressed with the extensive set of notes that
had been written at <A HREF="http://www.practicallynetworked.com/">http://www.practicallynetworked.com/</A> about it.
(I just checked again -- those notes ran from early 2000 through
early 2002 and presumably any early-model problems have long since
gone away.) Even the manual that came with the router/switch is
literate and useful!  As I said, mine has been flawless.

It sits on the ethernet between the house-side of a cable-modem
(supplied by the cable company) and our 3 Macs -- a B&amp;W G3 still
running OS 8.6, a PowerBook G4 still running OS 10.2.8, and
a brand new iMac running 10.4.8 -- and our HP LaserJet 2100M
printer is on the 4th port so that any of the Macs can get to
it directly (there is an Ethernet/Appletalk converter box between
the Linksys and the printer).  You didn't say if your printer
had a USB or Firewire interface: if so, then the printer would have
to be &quot;shared&quot; off one of the LAN-based machines.

But with the DHCP server in the Linksys, *all* of your local
machines will have a fixed IP address w.r.t. each of the others,
regardless of what the DSL-modem does dynamically w.r.t the WAN
side.
