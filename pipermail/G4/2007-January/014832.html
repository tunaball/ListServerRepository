<PRE>Greetings ( + )!( + )

This is your best deal, cost wise, however CCC will not copy all of the 
old disk to the new one. There are hidden sectors that are not 
copyable, so you need one of the application that copy the complete 
disk verbatim.
----------------------------------------------------
Snip-it
Hard Disk and Partition Imaging and Backup Software

The hard disk and partition imaging software take a snapshot of your 
hard disk so that you can restore your system at a later time to the 
exact same state the system was when you imaged the disk or partition. 
This is useful for system recovery in case of a hard disk disaster. The 
term &quot;image&quot; is used because such software often copy the state of the 
hard disk sector by sector to your image. Hence if your hard disk was 
(say) de-fragmented with certain software occupying certain sectors 
when you backed up, it will be returned to that same state when you 
restore your backup. The image utilities often do not allow fine 
control what you backup - you can specify the partitions or hard disks 
to back up, but you usually will not be able to specify which folders 
to exclude or include. They are useful for backing up your system drive 
or partition, that is, the drive that you placed your operating system 
on. Hard disk imaging software are sometimes also used to clone a hard 
disk to another (useful for the times you change or upgrade your hard 
disk).

On the other hand, the hard disk, folder and files backup software 
listed here allow a finer control over what you back up. You can 
selectively backup and restore (say) your documents and email while 
omitting other files and directories. Some of the utilities allow you 
to schedule your backups, so that you can be sure that your important 
data are backed up periodically (for example, daily, weekly, monthly, 
etc). Depending on the utility, it may or may not support the backup of 
your system drive (the drive you booted from).
See <A HREF="http://www.thefreecountry.com/utilities/backupandimage.shtml">http://www.thefreecountry.com/utilities/backupandimage.shtml</A>
----------------------------------------------------

What you need is an application that will recreate the entire disk 
because some of the older applications place the key to the software in 
specific sectors and blocks, so that when you go to start the 
application it looks for that key in the specific location and if its 
not there then the application will not work.
