About time, Apple is an Innovation company, always has been when Steve has
been around, which is why they made great computers (when he was around)
because innovation as the central ethos has been the key to Steve's
thinking.

It is also appropriate in an age where debate has arisen due to the
expressed beliefs of many key people in computing that the era of the PC is
coming to an end. In this world the PC will become less important as other
devices and appliances gain computer-like functions and the PC becomes a
behind the scenes integrator of interfaces that pop up everywhere. Look at
this new iPhone, it is pretty smart for a phone. The Star Trek situation
where computer functionality is built into everything and has a central core
and no individual independant desktops exist is not too far away. This
central functionality could easily occur at some distant location with all
functions accessed via internet connection. There are many signs, like
Google Apps that show that the early stages of this are already occurring.

Dropping the word 'computer' from the name is wise and shows Apple is still
at the cutting edge of technology and prepared for a future in which Apple
product continues to develop the future world.
