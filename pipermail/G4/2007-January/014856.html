<PRE>Maria, sorry for the late entry into your work.

Did you buy a large capacity drive? If more than 127GB, you will need  
an IDE/ATA card that can support this drive. You can probably get one  
at Best Buy or CompUSA if you can handle talking to those people.

The card goes in an empty slot. It should come with a ribbon cable,  
and you will need a new ribbon cable so you can transfer the data  
from your dying drive.

You unplug the computer (duh).

Let it sit for a few minutes. Make sure you are a) calm, and b)  
grounded (electrically)... Keep touching something metal and you  
should be ok.

Disconnect the existing drive from it's power and IDE connectors.  
(Careful)

There is a phillips screw that holds the drive bay to the computer  
base. Remove the bay.

Your new drive can sit on top of the old drive and be screwed into  
the side mounts of the bay.

At the back of the drive, there is a jumper (a rectangular plug about  
1/4 by 1/8&quot; long). Make sure that the jumper on the new drive is in  
the same position as the jumper on the old drive.

(Use tweezers to pull it and move it if necessary).

I find that it's easier, before I reinsert the bay, to plug in the  
power connectors to both drives.

Reinsert the bay and re-insert the screw.

Reconnect the old ribbon cable from the mother board to the old drive.

Connect the new ribbon cable from the new drive to the new card.

Plug in the power.

Close it all up.

Pray.

Start the system.

You may get a message saying that it cannot recognize the new drive,  
but it will give you the opportunity to initialize it. Do so.

Install Tiger from the DVD on the new drive.

At the end of the installation, Migration Assistant will start, and  
offer to copy your stuff from another volume.

Do that from your old drive.

Before you reboot, run disk utiility to verify/repair the new drive  
(you may have copied some bad stuff over from the old drive).

Run System Prefs/Startup Disk. Select the new drive.

Reboot.

Run Disk Utiliity/ Repair Permissions until it's clear.

Run Software Update till you're current.

Run Disk Utiliity/ Repair Permissions again until it's clear.

Good luck

David


ps. sorry if you've gotten this before.
