<PRE>Well of course it just blows me away how helpful you guys are.  I've  
posed maybe 4 questions here over the last year and gotten solid,  
considered advice.  Thanks.

The reason I want to replace one of the drives (maybe both if cheap  
enough without losing speed) is, I think one may be about to crater.   
I'm running OS 9 on one and Panther on the other.  I've seen some  
unexplained slowing of the performance (although it's only at 1/2   
capacity) and a few times when running under the Panther drive, the  
OS 9 drive failed to show up on the desktop.  I've run disk utility  
and Tech Tool Deluxe.  I'll be dropping the OS 9 soon, but I like  
having the ability to go back to old software that I don't think I  
can upgrade or export (I've been running my photo biz on Macs since  
''87).

So, I was thinking I should just spend $50 and replace the suspect  
drive (or both).  I just didn't think I could simply order any old  
IDE drive from Dealmac and plug and play.  Will I need to buy a  
different ribbon for that option?

~And more importantly (I use this machine for retouching on Photoshop  
CS), is there going to be a drop in performance moving from the 7200  
SCSI drive to an IDE?  Perhaps this is a basic question, but I'm not  
familiar with either the terminology or differences in drives and  
controllers.

Thanks again,

~Jay

</I>&gt;<i> Are you using OSX? If you are, you should use the disk

</I>&gt;<i> Next up the investment scale you can add a Sonnet

</I>&gt;<i> This works very well for me with a Maxtor 250Gb SATA

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However you can also just rip out your current scsi

</I>&gt;<i> pair of U160 SCSI drives that run from a ATTO UL3D pci
</I>&gt;<i> card.

</I>&gt;<i> Don't buy an Airport card, buy a wireless G PCI card.
</I>&gt;<i> I have one by Belkin that works with OSX out the box.
