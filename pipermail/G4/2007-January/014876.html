My initial reply was &quot;Clone with SuperD&quot; (when I thought her only goal 
was to get the content from the failing drive to a new disc).
After I realized an OS upgrade was not only a 'hitch' for the 'clone' 
(SD didn't support her config?) it also seemed obvious she would be best 
off moving up to Tiger.

Her existing apps?
Not a long list and if they are of her OS's era then freeware/open 
source (in addition to the included and improved apps w/Tiger) will 
leave not missing the 'past'.
Jeeze, I have the current stock of her oofice apps &amp; have found a better 
substitute for each of them.

So?
As I'm a 'clean-installer' w/any new OS + see little value in her 
existing apps compared to '07 alternatives + think she'll be more than 
impressed with the features (and xtras) w/Tiger...?
Yeah, a fresh disc and clean install is a tiny hurdle compared to the 
pay-off.

Maybe it's because the above path was so easy for me (w/the Mac) 
compared to similar nightmares with any new disc/OS from Billsoft.
But I really do think in an afternoon and the little cash for Tiger 
she'll end up wondering &quot;Why did I wait?&quot;
My G4 GE is only 400Mhz w/half-a-gig o' RAM but because of the superior 
OS/software it more than competes w/a 2.8Ghz XPee (except for serious 
CPUing).

Sure, cloning will get her current deal to a new disc (it's great if one 
only 'needs' to move a dupe). But there isn't much 'current' about what 
she'll be moving...
[IMHO]
