The bottom line is: about any Compusa DSL router will do; it'll have 
more features than you need right now.  You should have been using a 
firewall; it'll have one also.  Get one with at least two LAN ports 
(Mac+Toshiba), most have four or five.  Look for web-based configuration 
(I think they all have that anyway), that'll be compatible with any 
browser therefore either computer.  Better make sure its LAN side is 
100baseT, because now you'll have a network, too, and that'll be handy. 
  The funny thing is, both the Mac and the PC will get to the internet 
just fine, but they won't talk to each other very well.

For example, I bought a NetGear for home and a LinkSys for work, both do 
web config.  But I bought the NetGear for home because this particular 
model had a web-surfing tracking function (&quot;web-safe&quot;) that follows my 
teenager's tracks (he knows about it).

(Router terms: LAN = your internal network; WAN = the big wide world)
