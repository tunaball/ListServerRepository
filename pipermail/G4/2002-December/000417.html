<PRE>Daniel -

I had a similar problem with a G4 450 Sawtooth. I added an IBM 45GB 
drive and the vibrations came and went just as you have observed. I 
have since replaced the original 20GB Quantum drive with another IBM 
(80GHB) and I haven't had this problem since. I can't say for sure, but 
I believe the vibration may have had something to do with a mechanical 
resonance between the two drives spinning at the same speed but 
slightly out of phase.

You may try and reseat the drive carrier assembly and make sure the 
screws that attach the drives to the carrier are tightened (as well as 
the single screw that secures the carrier to the case.

Let me know what you find/John
