<PRE>Hello,

I tried yesterday (Monday) to get answers/recommendations from CompUSA
for a router and a couple of external drives, but the Apple rep wasn't
coming in that day, and I was told that there wasn't anyone in the store
at that moment who could answer any Mac questions.

Question #1: I have a G4 that I use all the time and a Toshiba laptop
that I use once in a while.  When I want to get online with the PC, I
have to unplug the DSL cable from my G4 and then plug the cable into the
PC.  I want to switch from one computer to the other without having to
unplug/plug-in the cable all the time.  From reading the messages on
this list, I think I need a router to do what I want to do.  The only
problem is that I don't know what I need in a router, and I don't know
what brand is a good brand, so I need recommendations for routers, if
possible.

Question #2:  I want to buy an external CD R/W drive for my G4 and would
like recommendations for CD R/W drives too.  I mainly want the R/W drive
so I can do backups of my G4 to a CD disk.

Question #3:  I also want a floppy drive, even though I don't need it
very often, I'd like to have it.  Any suggestions on what kind/brand of
external floppy drive I should buy?

Thanks for any help you can give me, I appreciate it.

Sharon
