<PRE>1) the reason i would want real audio capture software is so that i can 
listen to my favorite NPR shows on my ipod -&gt; i am at work when they 
are on the radio.

2) i can test drive a car before i buy it, so why cant i test drive 
music? i dont like spending $20 for an album with on decent song-thank 
god for used cd stores ($5 saturdays at the record archive!) and 
ordering straight from the bands (save $10 on the white stripes albums 
when you order directly from them) and $10 records at shows (the best 
place to sample and buy an artists music)

3) i do not condone stealing art. yes i do on occasion provide friends 
with cd's chock full of mp3s, but i also tell them to buy anything that 
they really like, because i like to support my fellow artists.


and mark, as far as being proud to have all that music and not to have 
paid for any of it, thats ridiculous. i have over 200 cds in my 
collection, and have never paid $20 for one, and probably havent even 
paid over $12 postage paid for 80% of them. skip the &lt;insert mass chain 
retail store here&gt; and buy it directly from the label/band, this way 
you cut the price in half, yet you still support the artists' work.

peace
