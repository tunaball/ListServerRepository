<PRE>Thanks all for the suggestions. 

For my use the best suggestion was to use a patch cord to connect the audio
output back to the input.  Doh!! Why didn't *I* think of that!

With Ultra-Recorder I was able to snag the tune I was after and save it as
an AIFF file. After editing this file a bit, there were several routes to
convert it to MP3. Got exactly what I was after. It took a little fiddling
to get it right...  Thanks for this super suggestion.

With regard to the raging debate... like it or not digital technology has
overtaken the world of things and stuff. We have a long way to go before all
this stuff sorts itself out in the marketplace and we have a fair way to
compensate musicians for their efforts.... tho most of us musicians do it
for the sheer delight of it and pleasure in sharing what moves us with
others.

The issue of underpaid musicians as been with us ever since musical
instruments were invented. Musician have never been fairly compensated for
what they have contributed to society... nor have artists either.  That's
why day-jobs were invented. The rich ( or even comfortable) musician is a
relatively recent blip in wo/man's evolution.... and they are really few and
far between. But that a wholly separate issue from the inroads digital
technology has made into the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; ways of sharing/distributing
the creative efforts of the few.

For my own ethic, I happen to believe it's wrong to rip commercial CD's (or
vinyl or tape or wire or any other format technology) and give the
recordings to others. Tho it's OK for me to compile my own music collection
in any way I choose to.
    However if a piece of music is broadcast or otherwise made available in
the public domain by a legitimate website which is making it available for
the purpose of having people listen to it, I should have every right to
record it and use it for my own private purposes.  The key word here being
&quot;legitimate&quot;.... my definition of legitimate does not include the ded head
kid down the block who rips borrowed CDs and puts 'em up for anyone to
steal.

Cheers,  and again thanks for the tip about the patch cord.

John

&gt;<i> This thread on DVD capture reminds me that I have been looking for a way to
</I>&gt;<i> capture a RealAudio file and ultimately convert it to MP3.  Is there a way
</I>&gt;<i> to do that on my G4?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tried using the Windows oriented recorder found at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://rawavrecorder.homestead.com">http://rawavrecorder.homestead.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But alas, the Dell laptop I was using had no peecee sound card which
</I>&gt;<i> apparently is required. Otherwise it looks as if that kind of app would do
</I>&gt;<i> the trick.
</I>&gt;<i> Has a comparable recorder for MacOS become available?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> John
