<PRE>
I have two files that I want to dump. Are they 
part of OS X or something important? Did they come 
from DiskWarrior?

The two files are in OS 9 and are
.DS_STORE  on my desktop and invisable and
 &gt;DS_STORE  on my hard drive and also invisable

I picked em up when I ran Nortons DiskDoctor on my 
OS 9 HD.

It may also be good to understand that I have OS 9 
on one HD and OSX on another and have never 
choosen a Classic or ever opened anything in 
Classic. I do think that some of the software I 
have installed into OSX has thought that my OS 9 
HD was my classic and gone on to update itself on 
my OS 9 HD as if it were classic. Installed in OSX 
is Netscape 7, Photoshop 7, Illustrator 10, 
Acrobat 5, Indesign 2, Office X, and Bugdom (demo 
for X).

I also found some files called
_DS_STORE
spread in various places on my HD in OS 9 and 
would like to squash these as well.

I am thinking I have a cookie or something 
collecting info on my HD that is creating them. 
Most of them are in folders that have content that 
came from the web and many folders contain files 
downloaded from Microsoft. Anyone got any answers?

Thanks

jj
