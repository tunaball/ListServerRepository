Hello G4 list...
I could sure use some help. I got one of the June '03 Dual Boot G4's and it didn't
come with an OS 9 software disk or startup disk. Actually it didn't even come with a
X software disk. It just came with one disk - a restore disk.
&gt;<i>From what I can tell all you can do is restore the software back to original state
</I>the computer was delivered in....(great!)
At the moment I am having to spend most of my time in OS 9 because my printer won't
behave in X and  I can't afford to buy more new software right now.
I have tried to make a bootable OS 9 repair disk so that I can run my 9 utilities
(Norton Utilities, TechTool, Disk Warrior) but the disks I made won't boot. I have
tried a few different approaches using Toast, and it is driving me crazy, now.

ANY suggestions? Or... a website with definitive directions. There seem to be many
different ways to make a bootable disk. Which one works?

(Another question in reference to the 10.2.8 update: At the risk of sounding dumb -
what is the &quot;combo&quot; update?0

Thanks very much,
C.C.
