<PRE>Christine,

The print drivers are located on your os x boot hard drive in the 
&quot;Library&quot; Folder then in a folder called &quot;Printers.&quot; Once you find that 
then look for the brand of your printer probably in the &quot;Hp&quot; folder, 
but now that I look at it your printer might be in the PPD's folder in 
a folder named &quot;en.lproj&quot;. On my computer there is actually a 
(?driver?) for your printer called &quot;HP LaserJet 2100 Series.gz&quot;  &gt;. I  
am not sure if it is a driver or not.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Christine,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Did you try deleting  and then re adding your printer to the Print
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Center, right.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not too familiar with the HP2100M printer. Is there any other way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to connect it to your to computer other than through the D-link print
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server? There might be a problem with the Printer itself or the D-link
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> print server. Do you have another computer to connect it to possible a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PC with a parallel port to make sure that the printer is working. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the printer works while directly connect then you know something is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either messed up on the mac os's or that your print server is either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> broken or more likely it's setting have magically changed. So check 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> print server's settings and make sure they are right. Also maybe go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with older drivers instead of the latest cutting edge drivers, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from HP the cutting edge most of the time does not work the first 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am tearing my hair out at this point.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have tried EVERTHING, apart from restoring the whole works. That is

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 9 as they were on my G3. I would go back to my G3 but I don't have a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> monitor for it anymore. Feel like I'm losing the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> battle with my G4 and OS X right now.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Does Gimp-print work with HP Postscript printers? Is it easy to

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also I have tried PrintCenter Repair to clear the problem in X but it

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ****One other thing, My printer shows up in chooser as PS-4AC9AE-P1
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> instead of HP laserjet 2100M like it used to on my G3.****
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> also, i have the latest HP driver (a lot of good that probably does)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Any clues. Any help is greatly appreciated. I am working on a
