<PRE>   I just subscribed to DSL and installed Norton Personal Firewall on my 
Quicksilver 733 running 9.2.2 and 10.1.5. Everything was OK till a few 
days ago when I booted into OS 10.1.5 and Norton started giving access 
warnings like crazy. Access was denied to each one, but my control panel 
was indicating that I was sending information out. When I tried to 
disconnect, my Mac automatically re-connected and I can't access the 
Internet at all for the activity. I have to turn off the modem to stop 
the activity, but my computer still tries to re-connect. I don't really 
know for sure what is going on, but I believe I've been infected with a 
virus of some sort. My Norton Anti-Virus update has run out, but I guess 
I had better update it. I read about a security update on OS X recently, 
but I thought it was only for 10.2. I could'nt download it now, anyway, 
from OSX. Anyone have a similar experience?

Thanks
Fred
