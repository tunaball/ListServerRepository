<PRE>Unfortunately, most companies do not do support very well.  They 
maintain an affordable level of service and we cannot get all the 
answers we need. The website of the manufacturer should give the most 
current and accurate detail but some do not have good sites.

This is why we have these chat/bulletin board lists. Like hippies at 
Woodstock &quot;We're all in it together man&quot;.

Good luck - and complain - alot
