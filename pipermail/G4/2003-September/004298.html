I have to say that no I did not see the disclaimer. Also as far as the 
operation of the unit itself I did indeed take advantage of OWC's tech 
support which was quite nice, as long as you pay for the phone time.
  The problem came up in reference to I don't remember what but as soon 
as they asked my config they shut down on me. Not fair.
  Also while we are on the subject I called for some Final Cut support 
to ask some specific questions about new features in FCP 4.0.2 that may 
or may not be documented.
I was informed that this tech support number listed in the  FCP 
paperwork would only tell me how to unninstall or reinstall.
Big help. Over two years I have paid $1700 directly  to Apple for this 
software. Somebody could tell me how to name my clips the way I want or 
when to use the track pitch options.
