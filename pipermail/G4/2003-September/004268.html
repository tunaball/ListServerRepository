<PRE>I've had a similar, most likely unrelated problem when printing 
through USB to an HP postscript printer (1220C) from my strictly OS 
9.2.2 dual G4. If your still pulling your hair out at 2 am tomorrow 
morning it might be worth a shot in OS 9.

When I copy my disk over to another internal drive for backup, HP's 
print utility (I think) trashes the latest version of the driver 
leaving me with a non functioning desktop printer extension which 
isn't recognized by any App with the exception of HP's printer 
utility. If I forget to rename the driver before backing up, I have 
to trash all printer prefs and uninstall all HP software followed by 
a reinstall from an archived copy of the latest driver downloaded 
from HP's site. The thing that seems similar to your problem is that 
the software from the original HP disk won't work on a re-install 
even though it worked fine before the initial backup.

Good Luck,

Frank

</I>&gt;<i>Now I can't print to my HP 2100M from my G4 in OS 9 either. First it 
</I>&gt;<i>was just in OS X that had the problems, now it is 9 as well. Won't 
</I>&gt;<i>print from Quark or Photoshop, maybe others. The Print monitor says 
</I>&gt;<i>it is &quot;processing an unkown job&quot; or is &quot;busy spooling a job
