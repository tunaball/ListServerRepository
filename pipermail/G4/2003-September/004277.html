&lt;&lt; HI, I need to burn a CD for a client that uses windows xp.  I have written
one already that his pc rejected &quot;...corrupted or wrong format...&quot;  the
formats are Jpeg and Tiff.   &gt;&gt;

My recent experience with this issue (9-23-03) was resolved with the 
following steps:

1. Convert the image files to bitmap (.bmp) format using GraphicConverter or 
save a copy of them in that format with the original creation software.
2. Use Roxio Toast Titanium to burn the CD and select the &quot;Mac OS and PC 
(hybrid) CD&quot; format for it. This selection is available in the drop-down menu 
right above the data window of the Toast interface.
3. Select the burn speed at one step slower than the maximum recommended by 
the Toast software.

I was able to make copies of desktop pictures that I had saved as JPEG files 
and they read perfectly on my friend's PC. He is now using the images as his 
&quot;wallpaper&quot;.

For some reason, his PC would not read a JPEG file even when the CD was made 
as a hybrid. It took three tries, but the system described above worked to our 
satisfaction after I converted the images to the bitmap format.
