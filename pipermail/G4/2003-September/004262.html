<PRE>What Bothers me is that these &quot;oops&quot; updates that are not ready to go 
are released. Is this occurring more frequently than it did in the 
past? 10.2.8 and 10.2.6 both had some issues when released initially. I 
remember with 10.0.x and 10.1.x there were not  many &quot;breakers&quot; if any 
that I can recall. They seemed to release updates every other week back 
then all seemingly working right. I find it understandable that this 
happens but I also find it inexcusable , because  mac os x  has to  run 
on about 20 different kinds of systems. So if tests were done on a 
majority of the machines they needed to support they would have most 
likely caught the problems.

Generally useless comment Any Suggestions or comments to it.....
What seems like is happening at apple is that they are staying current 
with their testing? Meaning they only are testing the latest hardware 
(which is good in one way...) not the older equipment that is out there 
like Powerbook g3's? Did people have problems with new computers in a 
current setting(current setting meaning Wireless Airport or 100-Base 
plus networking)? Probably at apple they are staying current and 
testing on newer stuff not using 10-Base ethernet but using wireless 
,100-Base and  gigabit network connections, etc...
