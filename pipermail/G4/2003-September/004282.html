<PRE>i dont know many companies that support user-altered goods. with cars, 
you change the computer control unit, the exhaust system, the heat 
exchange unit, you lose your warranty (unless you return it to the 
condition in which it was warranted.)

same thing with the 50 and 60 thousand dollar systems i work with every 
day at work-we change something, anything, and the manufacturer no 
longer supports it.
i would only think apple would have the same policies as most everyone 
else involved in commercial sale of goods.
