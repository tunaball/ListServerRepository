<PRE>With OS9 you can drag it over but it does present some problems.

First, use Norton and check everything, then optimize or defrag the 
disk completely and run the Apple hardware checker and then check your 
RAM for an evening with a Ram checker program.  All this will ensure 
you can make exact copies.

Second, you cannot copy a few gig and get perfect copies with drag and 
drop- do it in equal chunks (as small as is reasonable) and then use 
the key   Apple + I on both folders (original and copy) and look at the 
Bytes - they need to be identical for a perfect copy.

Third, locate every Alias and redirect it to the same place on the new 
disk (all your aliases will point to the old original disk - including 
and system aliases. The aliases are a total pain in the assets of your 
time.

Forth, All your graphic files that were constucted in the past will 
reference the old original disk for their Links (a special pain 
reserved for graphic designers doing layout).  So every time you open 
something from the past you get to update all the links to the new disk 
or ask &quot;What's wrong with this picture?&quot; alot

My advice, RE-INSTALL your OS and all your programs.  It may take a day 
or two but most of the above problems are totally elliminated and you 
get the brand new fresh install to kill any slow acting (compounding) 
problems from the past that eventually kills your system (or just slows 
it down).
