12-inch: 1GHz,

2003 has been &quot;the year of the notebook&quot; for Apple. Industry averages 24-25
percent all computers sold as notebooks; Apple sold 42 percent last quarter.
Jobs recapped 17 PowerBook configurations.

Jobs reiterated &quot;end of this year&quot; release schedule for Panther.

Over 500,000 downloads of iChat AV since release.

Jobs has moved onto a demonstration of iChat AV. He bills it as &quot;video
conferencing for the rest of us.&quot; He demonstrated sending and receiving
iChat AV sessions both to London and from Cupertino.

Jobs also demonstrated Expos&#233;, which tiles open windows, FileVault
encryption, the Pixlet video codec and more. He demonstrated Panther's PDF
rendering capabilities.

Mac OS X: Apple's goal is to have 10 million daily users &quot;before too long.&quot;
Panther will be &quot;as big if not bigger than Jaguar.&quot; Jobs then led into a
discussion about some of the features and benefits of Panther, like its
ability to play well in Windows network environments and its user-centric
interface.

The audience was shown the introductory video for the Power Mac G5 that
Apple posted to its Web site following the device's WWDC debut in June.

&quot;We've committed before the end of next summer&quot; to get the Power Mac G5 to
3GHz.

&quot;G5 is one of the most important product announcements we've made in a long
time.&quot; Stands by previous 'fastest personal computer' remarks. Recapped
information previously offered to WWDC and Macworld CreativePro attendees
about the architecture, features and prices of the G5.

Jobs started by introducing the new 20 and 40GB iPods. Apologized for not
having them more available.
