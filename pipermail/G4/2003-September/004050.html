&lt;&lt;  I have tried to figure out how to get the drive sled out (not the dual 
1st and 
third sled), and can't do it.  &gt;&gt;

It is possible that your third drive sled is altogether missing in action. If 
you do not see a very small phillips screw in the center of the edge closest 
to the motherboard, then I suggest that your sled is gone to parts unknown and 
you will have to try to locate a replacement.

If the screw is present, then you must remove it before attempting to remove 
the sled from the mounting plate. Once the screw is removed, lift the edge of 
the sled closest to the motherboard about 1 &amp; 1/2 inches and pull it toward 
the motherboard to disengage the tabs on the bottom of the sled from the 
mounting plate.

You can now mount any size device (1&quot;, 1.5&quot;, etc) that will fit on the sled 
without interferring with the other devices already in place (heat sink, PCI 
cards, etc). You should examine the power connections and bus ribbons to be sure 
that you have enough power connections and a long enough ribbon to reach to 
the new device.

Also, be sure to identify the device with a distinctive identity to not cause 
a conflict with your older devices identities. 

Have a safe day.
