<PRE>Christine,

Did you try deleting  and then re adding your printer to the Print 
Center, right.

I am not too familiar with the HP2100M printer. Is there any other way 
to connect it to your to computer other than through the D-link print 
server? There might be a problem with the Printer itself or the D-link 
print server. Do you have another computer to connect it to possible a 
PC with a parallel port to make sure that the printer is working. If 
the printer works while directly connect then you know something is 
either messed up on the mac os's or that your print server is either 
broken or more likely it's setting have magically changed. So check the 
print server's settings and make sure they are right. Also maybe go 
with older drivers instead of the latest cutting edge drivers, because 
from HP the cutting edge most of the time does not work the first time.
