<PRE>Hi Daniel,
Yup, I tried all the things below and more. Printer works fine on G3. i ruled out the new D-link server by returning it and getting another ...exactly same problem.
However, I can't really figure out how to set the print server settings as the software on the disk is only PC software. The D-link pocket server is just a connector between the parallel port and my ethernet port. I have printed a few times so I know the server is
working. When I first installed it, it worked right out of the box.

As for using older drivers, I tried that in OS 9 same problem, but couldn't find any older ones for X.
**I don't know if this is a clue, but my printer shows up in 9 and X as &quot;PS-4AC9AE-P1&quot; instead of &quot;HP 2100 LaserJet Series&quot; the name of the pdf file, like it used to.
What I can't understand is why is it behaving the same way in 9 and X?
Another question:  where are the print drvers kept in OS X?
**I am having a hard time getting used to where everything is in X. There seem to be a lot of folders named &quot;PPD&quot; and I don' know whick one is the path I should give to Print Center Repair so it can install the print driver.
Thanks again,
Christine

</I>&gt;<i> Did you try deleting  and then re adding your printer to the Print
</I>&gt;<i> Center, right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not too familiar with the HP2100M printer. Is there any other way
</I>&gt;<i> to connect it to your to computer other than through the D-link print
</I>&gt;<i> server? There might be a problem with the Printer itself or the D-link
</I>&gt;<i> print server. Do you have another computer to connect it to possible a
</I>&gt;<i> PC with a parallel port to make sure that the printer is working. If
</I>&gt;<i> the printer works while directly connect then you know something is

</I>&gt;<i> broken or more likely it's setting have magically changed. So check the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is X residue in OS 9 (on a dual boot G4). Is this my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; imagination or is it based in fact?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At one point it would actually spool the job I was trying to print

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like it had printed, but there was never any output. This is so weird.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am tearing my hair out at this point.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have tried EVERTHING, apart from restoring the whole works. That is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; beyond my last resort. All of my setting and software are the same in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 9 as they were on my G3. I would go back to my G3 but I don't have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; monitor for it anymore. Feel like I'm losing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; battle with my G4 and OS X right now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does Gimp-print work with HP Postscript printers? Is it easy to setup?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also I have tried PrintCenter Repair to clear the problem in X but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; didn't help. I wish I could figure out what is going on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here is my set-up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; G4 dual 1.25, Dual-Boot - connected to HP2100M using D-link DP101
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; print server to ethernet port of G4.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ****One other thing, My printer shows up in chooser as PS-4AC9AE-P1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of HP laserjet 2100M like it used to on my G3.****
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also, i have the latest HP driver (a lot of good that probably does)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any clues. Any help is greatly appreciated. I am working on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intensive job right now and desperately need the printer to work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks.
