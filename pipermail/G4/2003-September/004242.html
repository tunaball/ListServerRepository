TITLE

Mac OS X 10.2.8: Can't Connect via Ethernet After Installing Update

Article ID: 107669
Created: 9/23/03
Modified: 9/24/03

TOPIC

After updating Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server to version 10.2.8, you may 
not be able to connect to the Internet or your network. This only 
affects some computers using a 10BASE-T Ethernet connection.

DISCUSSION

Symptom

You cannot access the Internet or local network resources after 
updating to version 10.2.8.

Your computer's IP address is in the 169.254.x.x range.

Products affected
o Mac OS X 10.2.8
o Mac OS X Server 10.2.8
o Power Mac G4 (Gigabit Ethernet) - dual 450 MHz and dual 500 MHz 
computers only
o Macintosh Server G4 (Gigabit Ethernet) - dual 450 MHz and dual 500 
MHz servers only
o Any 10BASE-T network hardware (hubs, switches, routers)
o Many DSL (digital subscriber line) and cable modems with 10BASE-T 
Ethernet ports

Note: The built-in Gigabit Ethernet ports on the affected computers 
can automatically switch between 10BASE-T, 100BASE-T, and 1000BASE-T 
speeds to match the network they are on.

Solution

Apple has removed Mac OS X 10.2.8 until an update that resolves this 
issue can be made available. This update is expected to be available 
soon, and this document will be updated at that time.

Workarounds

Consider using one of the following workarounds until the update is available.

Note: Wherever a hub is mentioned, a switch or router could be 
substituted if properly configured. See the device's manual for 
configuration information.

1. For cable and DSL modems with 10BASE-T ports: Do not connect the 
computer directly to the modem. Instead, connect the computer and the 
modem to the same 10/100BASE-T hub.

2. For local area networks (LANs): If you can connect the computer 
directly to a 10/100BASE-T or 100BASE-T hub, you should do that. If 
you don't have that option, place a 10/100BASE-T hub between your 
computer and your normal 10BASE-T connection.

3. If a wireless network is available, use an AirPort card to connect.

4. If you have a third-party Ethernet PCI card, install it in your 
computer in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Change 
the computer's settings in Network preferences to use this card.

5. If you don't have access to the hardware items mentioned above, 
you can perform an Archive and Install from your Mac OS X 10.2 
Installation disc. After reinstalling, use the Software Update 
feature of System Preferences to update to Mac OS X 10.2.6. For more 
information, see technical document 107120, &quot;Mac OS X 10.2: About the 
Archive and Install Feature&quot;.

Note: If you perform an Archive and Install installation, it's OK to 
select Preserve User and Network Settings.
