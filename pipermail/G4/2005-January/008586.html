Was the first hard drive upgraded from OS9, or does it have a clean

What is the file system being used on the first drive? On the second 
drive?

Perhaps there is something having to do with differing file 
systems...perhaps some games that run under OSX need a certain file 
system to run.

Jonathan,

The first drive was upgraded from OS 9 way back when OS 10.1 came out, 
and then was upgraded by increments as the upgrades became available. 
Each upgrade was done in series and permissions were repaired after 
each upgrade. All cron programs were also run prior and subsequent to 
each upgrade. I don't believe that there was any problem with the OS 
installations because of my care and concern taken during the upgrade 
procedures.

All my hard drives are formatted in HFS+ format with journaling 
disabled. The game is running on a 60Gb Maxtor without any problems. 
The problem drive is a Maxtor 40Gb unit, but it has many third party 
software programs such as MightyMouse, FruitMenu, ShapeShifter, etc, 
installed on it.

I am thinking that the problem occurred after the last update of 
ShapeShifter, but am not sure because I didn't play NWN for almost a 
week after doing that update. I also installed a couple of new programs 
during that same time period, so they might have had some influence on 
the drive also.

I have considered doing an &quot;Archive and Install&quot; to try that as a fix, 
but I am happy with the performance of the first drive except for the 
problem with NWN. All my productivity programs are running without 
problems on that drive. Now that I have installed NWN on the backup 
drive, I can simply boot to it when I feel like playing.
