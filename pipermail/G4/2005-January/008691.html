<PRE>Saw this on one of my other lists and think some may find it of use. I have
no connection with the software or the company; nor do I plan on using it.

Announcement:

iMagine Photo is a powerful image and movie frame processing tool for
AppleScript. iMagine Photo includes a full range of drawing commands
and filter effects. iMagine Photo can read and write a comprehensive
range of exif information. iMagine Photo can create and convert image
files and create movies built up from individual frames.

iMagine Photo has been updated to version 2.1. A summary of the update
is below, but full information can be viewed on-line at:

<A HREF="http://www.yvs.eu.com/imagine.html">http://www.yvs.eu.com/imagine.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.yvs.eu.com/imaginephoto.html">http://www.yvs.eu.com/imaginephoto.html</A>

or you can check out the documentation:

<A HREF="http://www.yvs.eu.com/documentation/index.html">http://www.yvs.eu.com/documentation/index.html</A>

This update includes:

&#239;  iMagine Photo is now free
&#239;  iMagine Photo also includes the creating movies functionality
previously only available in iMagine Video.
&#239;  Bilinear interpolation for removing hot pixels using a pixel map has
been added
&#239;  The ability to add an icon to an image file when exporting
&#239;  Automatic gamma correction can be turned off
&#239;  Automatic colour matching can be turned off
&#239;  Improved performance and functionality when modifying image files in
place
&#239;  iMagine Photo no longer crashes when a graphic document is asked to
make a composition element instead of using the create composition
element command. Using make composition element will now cause iMagine
Photo to return an error.
&#239;  Work around for a memory size check error returned by Quicktime
&#239;  Obtains the correct colour profile when adding a colour profile to a
graphic exporter
&#239;  The conflict between the definition of a source rectangle of a
graphic importer and the source rectangle for adding a frame to a movie
has been resolved. Previously this was a bug in iMagine Video only.
&#239;  The export file location property of a exporter can now represent
long unicode file names even when the file doesn't yet exist.
&#239;  When a graphics exporter attached to a graphic importer exports, the
resolution it exports at is the resolution of the imported graphic file
unless the export resolution was set. If the export resolution had
never been set, when queried it always returned 72.0 even when the
resolution of the imported graphic file was 300.0. The export
resolution property now accurately reflects what the resolution of the
exported graphic file will be even if it hasn't been set.
&#239;  Returning a list of importers now works.
