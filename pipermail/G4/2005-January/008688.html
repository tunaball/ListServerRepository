<PRE>I had a similar problem with a Radeon 8500 but in that it would not actually complete the boot process and land me in the OPEN monitor.  So, given that difference, this may not work but what I had to do was boot the machine into OS 9 to get the old NDRV file.  For some reason, the newer NDRV failed to allow the card to boot so I used the older version once it loaded it worked fine (I might have also removed the file from my OS X disk - it has been a while)...it's a bit dodgey, but the problem is likely a driver version issue since it does work with the minimal driver set up on the install disk...you might have the same compatibility problems I encountered...

Good luck!

Subject: [G4] Video card upgrade troubles (9700).

Howdy, 

While I am searching the Web for information, I thought I'd post here to 
cover my bases... 

I am trying to install an ATI Radeon 9700 OEM (DVI &amp; ADC ports) into my G4 
Digital Audio 533DP running 10.3.  It is to replace the original Radeon that 
has been in the system since 2001.  I am running an Apple VGA display via 
one of those wee DVI-VGA adapters (on the 9700). 

The trouble is that, with the 9700 installed, I only get a blank blue screen 
after startup -- though the mouse pointer DOES appear and is fully movable! 

What's more, if I boot off the 10.3 install CD, things seem to display just 
fine. 

I have tried downloading and installing the latest software from ATI, though 
they do not seem to have something labeled, specifically: Mac Radeon 9700 
Driver.  I downloaded the ATI Monitors control panel. 

I installed, on an extra drive, a new copy of 10.3, which I then updated to 
10.3.7 in the hopes that that would cure all, but the end result is the 
same...  A lonely mouse pointer swimming in a sea of blue. 

It's getting pretty frustrating, as enough time has passed since i bought 
the card that a return is probably not possible... 

Anyone running a 9700 in a Digital Audio G4? 

Any help would be spiffy. 

Thanks, 

Alex
