<PRE>Greetings ( + )!( + )

I was trying to remove the partitions on my 120 Gb main drive, the one 
that is listed in the system profile first, the one that is connected 
to the last connector on a G4 Sawtooth, and ran into some problems. And 
by problems I mean that the system wouldn't boot, well no problem as my 
second disk 120 Gb which is connected to the first connector has OSX 
10.3.9 installed and is current.

WRONG, no matter what I did, I couldn't get the G4 platform to boot. 
Well after a whole lot of frustration I did get it to boot from the OSX 
install disk, however I couldn't install OSX 10.3 on the errant disk 
and when I choose my second disk (the good one) as the start-up disk, 
no luck it wouldn't boot.

So I decided to reverse the order of the installed disks and see if I 
could get started and reformat the disk that had gotten screwed up. 
Well that didn't work either, I had to take the bad disk completely out 
of the system before I could get the platform to boot.

You may ask did I ever get the bad disk formatted, Yes, however I had 
to put it into my external USB drive housing. Then I was able to format 
the drive and reinstall it into the system. Why didn't I keep it in the 
USB housing, because I keep a 200 Gb drive in there because as you all 
know, if I put the 200 Gb drive inside of the G4 platform I would only 
had access to 120 Gb.

So my bottom line is, yes it might make a difference which order the 
drives are installed, but you can usually overcome any problems that 
might arise.
