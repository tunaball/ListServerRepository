<PRE>The reason for the non-working mouse and keyboard might be due to bad  
USB ports.  I have a Digital Audio that has the same problem.  When  
using an Apple keyboard and optical mouse, the machine would boot up,  
sometimes making the startup chime and sometimes no chime, but the  
machine would seem to power up halfway without any progress.  When  
the keyboard and mouse were removed (both with the mouse plugged into  
the keyboard and the mouse plugged into the only &quot;good&quot; USB port on  
the Mac itself), the machine would make the startup chime and boot  
normally.

The way to overcome this is a 4-port USB card that fit's in one of  
the PCI slots.  I have one that works a little flaky, but it works.   
Wal Mart sells a Mac-compatible 4-port (maybe 5-port if there's one  
for an internal component) USB card for around $20-$25.  Check their  
return policy if you don't plan on keeping it or using it with a PC.   
You'll have at least two extra ports if it works.  What model of  
studio display do you have?  Does it have USB ports on the back with  
the connector being ADC (Apple Display Connector - looks like DVI  
with rounded ends)?

Keep us updated.

Eric
