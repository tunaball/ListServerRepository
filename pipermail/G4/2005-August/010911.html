<PRE>At this point I don't even know what machine they've got. I think it's 
an iMac of some sort. She and her husband have resisted making the leap 
to OSX (even tho it's loaded on their machine) for fear that they'll 
mess somethin up. HE decided to change their boot disk to OSX on Sunday 
to see what would happen. And sure enough after starting up mail.app, 
he imported his mail and address book. Sure enough, now the address 
book is empty and all the mail is gone. Switching back to the OS 9 
start up disc apparently doesn't help, the mail in Outlook and the 
associated address book is &quot;gone&quot;.

And that's all I know about their current problem. Since I'm the local 
Mac guru, I get the SOS call. We'll see later today what he mght hve 
done. I've assured them that's it's very unlikely that the files are 
gone. More likely that they are some place unexpected.
