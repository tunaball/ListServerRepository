Jose,

Another fact that you need to keep in mind is that when you partition a 
disk the partition that is closes to the spindle of the disk is the 
fastest part of the disk. In most if not all disk drive the HFS+/FAT 
directorys are located on the disk tracks that are closest to the hub, 
and unless you have a system that keeps a directory of where data is 
located on the disk, every-time that the operating system makes a 
request for disk data the disk has to go to the inner tracks to locate 
where the data is located. If the data is located in the outer 1/4 of 
the disk (a disk that has been partitioned in 4 parts) then the heads 
have to first go to the inner part of the disk and then they are 
directed to the outer tracks. Needless to say this take time and if you 
are taking measurement as to how fast a disk responds to data retrieval 
this arrangement will be slow. If you check most disk access standards, 
they list random access, meaning of course that the write/read data 
access is across the entire surface of the disk.

Bottom line is that if you want speed and have partitioned a disk for 
Mac &quot;swap space&quot; be-sure to chose the partition that is closes' to the 
hub. If unsure chose one partition for your &quot;swap space&quot; and then run 
your test and then choose another.
