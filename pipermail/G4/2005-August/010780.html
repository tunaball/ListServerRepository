I have never seen a broken wire on a Mighty Mouse. In fact I haven't 
even seen a Mighty Mouse. But my X-acto knife is broken and my duct 
tape roll is empty from repairing older Apple mice that look a whole 
lot like the Mighty Mouse.

Let me see if I understand all this----
Your knife blade is broken, right? And, your duct tape roll has been 
emptied, also right? Thirdly, you have repaired other Apple mice that 
look like the new mouse, also correct?
It sounds to me like you have a defective logic board between your 
ears, not that having it would be a bad thing, and you cannot see the 
critical difference between the older and the newer mice and are 
jumping to a conclusion without adequate proof.

The older mice do not cost as much as the newer Mighty Mouse will and 
that is a TREMENDOUS difference. This difference may be the deciding 
factor in preserving the integrity of the attached mouse data cable and 
could negate the need for repairs in the future. This would be a 
gigantic savings for those of us who have only limited incomes (none of 
daddy's money in our bank accounts and we have to work for what little 
we get) and have to make daily decisions of where to spread our 
hard-won resources.

If, and I use the word in its strongest and most suspicious definition, 
the MM cable is subject to untimely wire separation which could require 
repair/replacement by the user, then it is likely that investing 
limited moneys in the purchase would be foolish. However, unless the 
problem is completely studied and documented, I would feel that this 
notice regarding &quot;broken wire&quot; is untimely and provocative in nature 
and should be removed post-haste.

This having been said, I will return to playing Apeiron. I'm retired 
and don't have to work for my money any more.
