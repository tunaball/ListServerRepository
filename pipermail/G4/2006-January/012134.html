</I>Notice, my screenname is changed (not the address)

I wuz 'Slip Kid' - - So, let me in!

I'm still new to a Mac (November '05 - -  G4 GE) after a couple decades 
with PC's. 

Hey  - -  - I knew nuthin' - - - and can't seem to screw up. 
Still, I avoided OS X for months...My G4 GE only has 400MHZ ( a great 
eboo deal) and 16Mg Vid.  (Also came wit' a 20G HD! .. )  It did have 
half a gig o' RAM.

I added a 120G HD (&amp; and swapped the 20Gig with spare 40 from a PC after 
the T. install.  

I figured the T would be a drag on my resources...400Mhz and 16MG o' 
graphics?! Nah, I wuz in no hurry as it was working better than fine.

Last week I made the leap.
Well, it went in (about an hour?)...I rebooted and has run like a gem 
for a week or so.  (I used SuperduperFree a couple days ago and put the 
contents of Disc 0 from the original 20Gigger w/ T. to the 40Gigger...I 
rebooted and even though it was left on disc 1 where it was cloned from 
disc 0 - - - All the paths to the swapped discs [ 0&lt;---&gt;1 ] are fine...I 
left the HD's  on the 'wrong channels' as all is well enough)

Nah, not only did OS X go in without a hitch...if anything it's smoother 
than 10.3.9....(This is just for the 'Scared like me folks&quot;...See, an 
idiot with an old box did it and it runs and runs better)

Oh,  sorrry I can't help with a clue fer ya..in the MacScene...But - - 
But beyond bragging - - - Well, I am kinda proud I caught on to the Mac 
world and can't screw anything up.  I'd like a Gig+ CPU, but I only get 
occasional spikes (But send me a one and in bolt it in).

I can lend my Win lessons, RE: Installs

After dozens of Winstalls...a quck checklist for glitches:
1. Don't upgrade...either wipe the drive and start clean or at least 
yank the old OS.  (I did not as I was not sure T. would work an didn't 
have the original Panther disc...I wasted some space &amp; time...but it worked)
2. You do have a legit copy.  [Not a question]  It's moot to discuss 
probs if one isn't using a confirmed media source...
3. I've found (in the WinWorld) a boot CD/DVD is not a perfect or 
foolproof process.
So:
  A. Do you have 'good luck' with boot ROMs in general?
Even in Win it began as a less than foolproof process - - It's gotten 
better in latter years. 
My sense is that Macs are even more selective in the config of a boot 
OS? Dunno what an older Mac might mean for a boot CD?  Yeah, it was a 
concern for me.

  B. How's the optical drive?  [The first moments when it's looking for 
the critical boot sectors is the go-no go time. If it isn't kicking in 
then...that's yer prob...That is, if you boot and it sits, spins or seem 
confused...it's the drive/disc] 
Yeah, even if the drive is at all going to show a weakness to boot, you 
can use it for anything - -( But a boot ) And not notice it's a bit off.
My 'original' DVDRom in the GE is hardly state of...It's not the 
speediest (I use an external USB20 for burning)...
I did expect it to balk...&amp;, well, I still need to try an install on the 
biggie drive...I'm only one for one. Yeah, I considor my original drive 
to be minimal.

  C. Before I started yanking periphs...I'd try a different disc or a 
differnet drive.  I'm not certain 'bare-memory' is a help &amp; if if the 
RAM is fine - Pulling stuff? It's only going to add another 'maybe' to 
your probs - - Confirm the health of the disc an optical?

D. How many failures did you have before you started getting creative?
As I don't follow this with a critical eye?  Are you not even getting 
the ROM to boot? 
Is the failure after/during the install? 

If you arent getting the ROM to kick in, check #3. 
There's a big diff between &quot;Can't install&quot; and &quot;Disc won't boot&quot;

Me...I'm Mr. Lucky. 

I only wish I was rich...I'm sure I'd even be happier wit' more juice in 
the box...but the sucker really is a joy.
