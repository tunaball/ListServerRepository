<PRE>Richard:

The military give out free vallium?

I have a dual MDD 1.25 ghz here and I could &lt;cough cough&gt; disks for you 
to use on yours.  Well the Apple diagnostic disk at least.

But would it not help to cart that puppy into an Apple store and let 
the genius there take a look.  I know they are expensive but they will 
tell you exactly what parts you need and how much Apple wants for them. 
  But with list in hand you could also look on ebay etc. for the bits.  
Remember though, Apple just replaces parts til they get it right.  To 
me, your ghost in the machine points to your motherboard or multiple 
other things that culminate in the error.  Ever have a bad wire?  I had 
a cube that had less problems (but ghosty too) and I sold it once I 
lost confidence.  Got an imac G5 instead.

My point being that the G5 line is about to get the crap kicked out of 
it (price wise) and there should be some awesome deals in the used 
dept. over the next 2 years.  I would not spend alot of money on this 
G4.  If you want the hardware disks then I will need an address ... to 
send to.

You could try installing OS9 on the beast to see if it swallows that.  
Do not try to Restore.  Run Disk Utility from the OSX install disk and 
wipe/reformat the drive.  Then install OSX or OS9 (try both).  Use a 
full install disk and a clean install for the OS.  Maybe your keyboard 
has a bad USB wire or the USB bus in the G4 has a problem.  Hey, you 
sure this is an Apple processor and not a 3rd party upgrade?

</I>&gt;<i> Dodge Ram, reset the processor, tried every memory slot with new and 
</I>&gt;<i> old
</I>&gt;<i> memory, and get laughed at by the bloody thing. I was convinced I had 
</I>&gt;<i> bad
</I>&gt;<i> memory, but alas get the same thing with both. So I now have a Gig of 
</I>&gt;<i> memory
</I>&gt;<i> for this thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I use the plain old OsX install disk, I get the happy mac face 
</I>&gt;<i> and the
</I>&gt;<i> beach ball (encouraging eh?) then the happy face tears in half and the
</I>&gt;<i> system once again laughs in triumph.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only other thing I can think of is maybe  have the wrong system 
</I>&gt;<i> restore
</I>&gt;<i> disks. It seems to get farther in the process with this disk. I get 
</I>&gt;<i> happy
</I>&gt;<i> Mac, then the grey Mac OS screen, then the blue MacOS screen with the 
</I>&gt;<i> weird
</I>&gt;<i> textured background and a moving like thermometer bar. Sometimes I get 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> the stylized person holding a disk then to the part where I get to 
</I>&gt;<i> select a
</I>&gt;<i> disk to restore to. Then either it sees no disk, or says the disk is 
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> compatible. This occurs on all three controllers and can die at any 
</I>&gt;<i> point
</I>&gt;<i> along the way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was able to get it to install Ubuntu and it works on any of the three
</I>&gt;<i> drive busses, but when it tries to start, the@#$#$% thing wont 
</I>&gt;<i> recognize the
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard so wont complete the boot process. That&#185;s where I very calmly
</I>&gt;<i> removed everything from the case, closed it, took 2 valium and sat 
</I>&gt;<i> here in
</I>&gt;<i> front of my trusty G4 AGP 400 that actually works, and placed my heart 
</I>&gt;<i> out
</I>&gt;<i> on my sleeve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are there any Mac Jocks out there that live in or around Newark, Ohio 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> might be willing (I will buy the beer) to cast a second set of eyes at 
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> thing? OR does anyone have the for sure correct restore disks for an 
</I>&gt;<i> M4570
</I>&gt;<i> 1.25 Ghz DP. I am almost in too deep to part it out now! :-(
