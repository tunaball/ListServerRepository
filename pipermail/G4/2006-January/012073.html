Anne,

I do computer recycling for volunteer work as a way of keeping out  
from under my wife's feet during the day, and I can tell you from  
past experience that most of what you have mentioned is useful as  
fishing weights and not much more.

SCSI drives of less than 9Gb just won't find a new home at all. The  
same for Zip 100 machines and cartridges and Syquest drives with any  
size cartridge. These things have mostly been replaced by the  
proliferation of flash USB sticks and portable hard drives like the  
Shuffle and iPod, All new Macs have a internal v90 or 92 modem, so  
old and slow external ones are boat anchors/

Older programs might have some interest for people who are still  
using previous versions of the OS, but even they want to run the  
newest that are compatible with their machines.

You can try eBay or search for vendors like MacTreasures that might  
offer you pennies on the dollar for those items, but don't hold your  
breath while waiting for their decision to buy.

Just comments based on my six years of recycling Macs with Computers  
for Classrooms, Inc.

Have a safe day.
