<PRE>&lt;snip Rich's incessant whining, moaning and gnashing of teeth&gt;
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a similar machine to yours, 1.25 dual MDD.  If I'm not mistakes
</I>&gt;<i> some of these models would not boot into OS9 but were OS 10 only.  The
</I>&gt;<i> model number should give a clue about that. I believe the non OS9
</I>&gt;<i> computers has a firewire 800 port and the others didn't but I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> sure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This one appears to have two FireWire ports
&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I use the plain old OsX install disk, I get the happy mac face and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beach ball (encouraging eh?) then the happy face tears in half and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system once again laughs in triumph.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess you are saying that the install disk mounts but when you try to
</I>&gt;<i> run the install app it bombs.
</I>Actually, I just hold the C key down and when the beachball starts, I let go
and watch it explode.
&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only other thing I can think of is maybe  have the wrong system restore
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disks. It seems to get farther in the process with this disk. I get happy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mac, then the grey Mac OS screen, then the blue MacOS screen with the weird
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> textured background and a moving like thermometer bar. Sometimes I get to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the stylized person holding a disk then to the part where I get to select a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disk to restore to. Then either it sees no disk, or says the disk is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compatible. This occurs on all three controllers and can die at any point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> along the way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have read through your posts and I don't see for sure how the jumpers
</I>&gt;<i> on the HDs are set. The manual calls for cable select on all drives.
</I>&gt;<i> Make sure the jumpers are set properly.  What works on the G3 may not
</I>&gt;<i> work on this machine.
</I>I learned right away about the cable select thing. This is completely
opposite of my prior experience.

&gt;<i> Since the machine was in parts, it seems that one of the wiring
</I>&gt;<i> connections may not be made up properly.  A pin may be bent, broken or
</I>&gt;<i> something like that.  Hard to find but worth looking at closely.  There
</I>&gt;<i> may even be a broken wire in a cable.  I have had all of these problems
</I>&gt;<i> in the past on various machines.  Also, you might want to try another
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard if you haven't as a stuck key can cause havoc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, these ideas probably wan't help much.  I am far from an expert in
</I>&gt;<i> this area.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck.  I hope the problem is not something that requires a major
</I>&gt;<i> investment as this is still a good computer, much better than the G3 I
</I>&gt;<i> think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Thanks, I have a lot of time on my hands and this is turning into an
annoying obsession. In 20+ years of working on PC's and Telephone systems, I
have never had my butt kicked like this. I must have retired at just the
right time!
