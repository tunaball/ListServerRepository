<PRE>&gt;<i> Richard:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The military give out free vallium?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a dual MDD 1.25 ghz here and I could &lt;cough cough&gt; disks for you
</I>&gt;<i> to use on yours.  Well the Apple diagnostic disk at least.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But would it not help to cart that puppy into an Apple store and let
</I>&gt;<i> the genius there take a look.  I know they are expensive but they will
</I>&gt;<i> tell you exactly what parts you need and how much Apple wants for them.
</I>&gt;<i> But with list in hand you could also look on ebay etc. for the bits.
</I>&gt;<i> Remember though, Apple just replaces parts til they get it right.  To
</I>&gt;<i> me, your ghost in the machine points to your motherboard or multiple
</I>&gt;<i> other things that culminate in the error.  Ever have a bad wire?  I had
</I>&gt;<i> a cube that had less problems (but ghosty too) and I sold it once I
</I>&gt;<i> lost confidence.  Got an imac G5 instead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My point being that the G5 line is about to get the crap kicked out of
</I>&gt;<i> it (price wise) and there should be some awesome deals in the used
</I>&gt;<i> dept. over the next 2 years.  I would not spend alot of money on this
</I>&gt;<i> G4.  If you want the hardware disks then I will need an address ... to
</I>&gt;<i> send to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could try installing OS9 on the beast to see if it swallows that.
</I>&gt;<i> Do not try to Restore.  Run Disk Utility from the OSX install disk and
</I>&gt;<i> wipe/reformat the drive.  Then install OSX or OS9 (try both).  Use a
</I>&gt;<i> full install disk and a clean install for the OS.  Maybe your keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> has a bad USB wire or the USB bus in the G4 has a problem.  Hey, you
</I>&gt;<i> sure this is an Apple processor and not a 3rd party upgrade?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> jj
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I would certainly appreciate a &lt;Cough wheeze cough&gt; chance to check out your
rebuild disks. My address posted earlier in the thread, but here it is
again.

Due to my illness I no longer drive. That is part of the problem here. I
have alllll daaaay lonnnnng to look at this thing and obsess. :-]

I found one obviously bad cable that looks like someone closed the case on
severed a couple wires on the high end (opposite the #1 wire) of the ribbon
cable. But that is on the Optical drive that is working fine. (Crazy heh?)
the shorter ones from the ATA66 and 100 controllers look pretty good. I have
a cable from an older HP that had an ata 66 controller. Same number of wires
but without the removed wire that enables the serial ATA. I will work that
into the rotation to see what that does.

I am mostly trying to get it to gimp along until the flood of goodies starts
to appear on ebay. Then will scarf one up.
 
&lt;Snip the whining&gt;


It is not enough to aim, you must hit.
