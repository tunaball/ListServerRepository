<PRE>Hi Loren,
Thank you for your advice and time...So let me see if I understand:  if I sign 
up for digest mode, I will only receive 1 email, and inside that will be ALL the 
responses for a certain time frame, including responses to MY issue?
And as for the stores: I used to go to the Mac store as well, but I got sucked 
into the cult.  do you think I should bring Mac store  into it?

&gt;<i> Digest mode is great if you have a monopoly like verizon for your phone 
</I>&gt;<i> service and they are too cheap to up grade their switching equipment down 
</I>&gt;<i> the street from me(all though they spend lot's of money sending me fancy 
</I>&gt;<i> fliers offering to upgrade to my connection to DSL I keep calling them back 
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; they tell me my line dosen't qualify yet) and you have nice slow dialup 
</I>&gt;<i> connections and it takes forever for your emails to open, anyway if you 
</I>&gt;<i> belong to any of these lists then all you have to wait for is one email to 
</I>&gt;<i> open and like there will be up to 20 (sometimes) comments from list members 
</I>&gt;<i> inside the one digest.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, have you been to the apple.com site? I don't know which ibook you have 
</I>&gt;<i> but a little while ago I was in the support section of their site and I saw 
</I>&gt;<i> something about logic board replacements in certain models of the ibooks , 
</I>&gt;<i> they had the model numbers listed, and they were extending their free offer, 
</I>&gt;<i> also they stated if you had already paid to have a new logic board installed 
</I>&gt;<i> that they would reimburse you for the amount spent. I've been to the 
</I>&gt;<i> University Village Store , &amp; for some reason I feel a lot more comfortable 
</I>&gt;<i> dealing with the people at the Mac store over on 45th.&amp; Roosevelt by I-5.
