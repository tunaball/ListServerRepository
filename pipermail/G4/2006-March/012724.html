<PRE>Hi Bill,

I've got the same printer... albeit with the DC option with the card  
reader. About 4 years ago, I got a great deal on another 870 and  
picked it up because I liked this one so much. I ended up giving it  
away last year and now it's living La Vida Loca at a friend's house.  
Mine is still plugging away, although it's getting a little less  
photo printing since I picked up a 2200 for those larger shots.

I've had EXCELLENT results with only one online ink merchant...  
<A HREF="http://www.ink4art.com">http://www.ink4art.com</A>  I can't recommend them highly enough...  
they've had great quality, quick service and great customer service.  
I've probably ordered from them about 20 times and on the one  
shipment that got messed up, they OVERNIGHTED me a replacement order  
on their dime. I've been using their ink for over 3 years and it  
works the same as the Epson carts for my dime. And it's about 75%  
cheaper as well.

I'm not going to slam the other ink vendors... the only other vendor  
I tried was a nightmare. I had to clean the heads at least 3 times to  
get the cart working... which burns up about 1/8 of the dang cart. Yuck.

Good luck with your printer.

smiles,
Jamie
