<PRE>Anne,

If you need a &quot;minus&quot; Rx for your distance vision, than most likely  
the OTC reading glasses won't work for you. I'm not real clear on  
whether your optometrist or ophthalmologist is  the doc who did your  
refraction (usually optometrists are better at this ;-)  ), but they  
would be able to write the correct Rx for you. You can bring that Rx  
wherever you'd like to get it filled. Try to support your  
optometrist, simply tell him you want something very inexpensive, but  
if it's still too expensive then go to Walmart or Costco or  
something. A strong suggestion is to make sure you get an  
antireflection coating on the lenses. It will help reduce eyestain.  
Please note that the &quot;perfect&quot; Rx for reading may not be the same as  
for computer use.

David Crandon, OD

</I>&gt;<i> ophthalmologist, if not correct script let optometrist put script

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or just suck in the extra cost, as a service to humanity? (Try only  
</I>&gt;<i> to go to Walmart when I am desperate, like twice a year!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Al mentioned exercise. I am swimming twice a week and doing yoga on  
</I>&gt;<i> the other days. I felt much better before Xmas and then sprained my  
</I>&gt;<i> ankle and didn't get as much exercise as I needed (that ankle is  
</I>&gt;<i> still kinda sore). I probably need to do MORE exercise, it really  
</I>&gt;<i> does help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to you all - I'll let you know what works - it's prolly a  
</I>&gt;<i> combo of factors and once I get them all working in tandem I'll  
</I>&gt;<i> have real improvement.
