<PRE>I'm on SBC DSL on their 3Mbps plan.  I routinely max it out.  I used to be
on their 6Mbps plan and would consistently get 5.2Mbps downloads, any time
of day.  (I lost that plan when I moved, as they didn't offer it for a
couple of years.  They now offer a 6Mbps plan once again, and I will
likely sign up for it sometime soon.)

Note that Comcast does *NOT* guarantee their download rates.  While the
rates may be consistent, they are by no means guaranteed... they don't
even guarantee a minimum.  SBC at least guarantees you a minimum 1.5Mbps
if you are on the 3Mbps plan.  Granted, the guarantee on the 6Mbps plan is
also 1.5Mbps...

I am considering switching to Comcast as well, haven't really made the
decision yet.  I've been happy with SBC so far, although I would like a
faster connection, hence the quandary about switching up to the 6Mbps
connection vs. switching to Comcast.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My answer is Cable modem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps it is peculiar to my locality, but I have fantastically fast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modem service through Comcast.  When downloading from a fast server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (for example getting updated software from Apple), the peak DL rates
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are something like 700 kBytes/sec, or 5.6 mbits/sec.  That is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; equivalent to about four T-1 lines.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The average DL speed is of course less, but almost always 200kBytes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (1.6 Mbits) per second.  That's about a T-1 line.  The cost is about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $55 per month, once you get past the introductory offers (first month
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $20, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The people I know who are on DSL get a 'guaranteed' 396 kbit/sec rate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or about 50kBytes/sec.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know the price of DSL.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DSL uses the same phone lines that your voice phone uses.  (The local
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; telephone techs call this &quot;flashlight wiring&quot;.) That is why you must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be within a certain distance (about three miles) from the nearest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; telephone central station or repeater.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problems that Comcast had a few years ago have been solved.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worst situation I face today is when, for some unknown reason, I find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my internet connection dead when I start up.  I unplug the modem for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a half-minute or so, plug it back in, and things are fine.  This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might happen about once a month.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I live in the San Francisco Bay area on the peninsula about 30 miles
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; south of San Francisco?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is your experience?  I would be especially interested in DSL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performance and price.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
