<PRE>I had a G3 that was eligable for a logic board extended warranty.  
When my logic board went, Apple was &quot;nice&quot; enough to put in the new  
board, despite being out of warranty. This was a couple of years ago.  
In Feb, the logic board went again! Apple refused to cover it this  
time. Cost to replace logic board $800 CAD. Cost of new G4 iBook with  
bluetooth, airport, USB 2, more ram, a larger HD etc, $1250 CAD.

So I went with the new iBook.

Anyway, unless you have a G3 iBook purchased in &quot;02 or so, I don't  
think the logic board programme is for you.

was nobody left to protest.&#8221;     Pastor Martin Niemolle



&gt;<i> Also, have you been to the apple.com site? I don't know which ibook  
</I>&gt;<i> you have
</I>&gt;<i> but a little while ago I was in the support section of their site  
</I>&gt;<i> and I saw
</I>&gt;<i> something about logic board replacements in certain models of the  
</I>&gt;<i> ibooks ,
</I>&gt;<i> they had the model numbers listed, and they were extending their  
</I>&gt;<i> free offer,
</I>&gt;<i> also they stated if you had already paid to have a new logic board  
</I>&gt;<i> installed
</I>&gt;<i> that they would reimburse you for the amount spent.
