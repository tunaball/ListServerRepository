<PRE>June, whichever way is easier for you to be able to copy your priceless
files from the boot drive in your G4 is the one you should do.

Then, after you connect that other 20GB drive to the G4 (I assume the 20GB
drive has a valid OS 9.2.2 System Folder or an OS X System folder) you
should change the Startup folder to the System folder on the 20GB drive.
Start up one time to that drive and see if everything starts up fine. Then
put the Disk Warrior CD (or whichever maintenance app CD you have) in the CD
drive and boot to the CD.

Let us know if DW recognizes your original boot drive and can repair it. You
may need to re-format that drive and start over, re-installing the OS and
all your apps. If so, consider that a good thing. All HDDs need to be
refreshed with a new formatting every now and again. If you need to go that
route, then use Apple Disk Utility to Erase the drive first, then Partition
it. First make sure you have all your serial numbers and such available for
re-installing all your apps.

HTH.

Subject: Re: [G4] Error of type -127


I do have a 20G drive that I could connect to copy my files to a good 
drive.
I am also on file sharing via another computer (this computer a G4 
which I can switch to OS 9.2.2 from OX Jaguar in order to get to the 
chooser, would that be recommended, since I am now able to start up the 
computer with the extensions off?
I tried to switch to the extensions that I made as my CD set, which is 
all extensions off and CD able to be usable, but it won't get past that 
15% of the progress line, and stops about there.
I can boot, but I cannot boot unless I have the extensions off, which 
means that I cannot use my CD Drive. I have a CD burner attached, but 
it is not like a CD Reader.
Please guide me further on what you mentioned in your second paragraph, 
about with both drives in the box.
My peripheral 20 G drive, does not have a way to hook to a CD does it. 
If I have the second driver connected, then will I be able to use my CD 
reader to put in DiskWarrior or Norton or Tech Tool Pro? I mentioned 
that I cannot get the iMac to start up without the extensions all 
turned off. I cannot get it to recognize my Extension that I made 
specifically with all extensions, but with the capability of using the 
Peripheral drive, I could copy the files, or could I chance it by using 
the chooser on the G4 started in OS  9 to copy files?

I can't rebuild the desk top because it won't get past the 15% progress 
line at start up where the finder is looking for the extensions. So 
that won't work.
June
