Let me try to clear this up a little bit.

I've worked with the MDD Power Macs in my home office, and checked out 
a number of them in dealer showrooms.

I do not regard them is overly noisy, no more so than the QuickSilver 
Power Mac I also use.

But it's also true that a number of users have different opinions. It's 
possible there is some variation in quality that makes some more noisy 
than others, or that certain individuals are more sensitive to the 
noise/. Some of those who have complained about the problem have even 
gone to third party suppliers to replace power supply fans to quiet 
them down. However, there is an Apple Knowledge Base document that 
covers the subject, suggesting that customers go to authorized service 
providers for assistance. This would seem a better alternative, since 
modifying the power supply would also void the warranty.

In any case, anyone who wants to buy an MDD Power Mac from the previous 
generation should listen to the computer at a dealer before taking it 
home. Put your ear up close and make sure it is not disturbing. Now 
bear in mind most users do put minitowers on the floor, so the noise 
will be less obtrusive in any case, but it doesn't hurt to check.

Apple says the newer models are quieter, but there's nothing wrong in 
comparing one against the other, especially if the older model can be 
had for really good price. The differences aren't that vast.
