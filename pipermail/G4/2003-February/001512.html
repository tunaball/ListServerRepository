<PRE>After not being able to get the computer restarted, meaning that it hung up
while loading the extensions, I finally got it to open with extensions off.
Then I looked at the extensions, and turned one of them off, and restarted,

Something dire happened tonite while I was linking to a rather large website
from a url link in an email to answer questions about being a computer

flickering. When I clicked on it, it gave the same Error of type-127. Can
someone please answer me asap.

I have a bondi blue G3 using OS 8.6. This is freaking me out.

not the Bondi Blue iMac
