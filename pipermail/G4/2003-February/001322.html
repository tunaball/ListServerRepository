<PRE>Kathy and Paul,

I was having the same annoying problem until last week.  I too was 
collecting mail every minute from several accounts.  I was turning on 
mail in the morning before I went to work, and retuning to find mail 
asking for my password.

Anyway, I solved the problem by going into Keychain Access and looking 
at the access control for each of my mail accounts.  I made sure that 
the box for &quot;Ask for keychain passowrd&quot; box was unchecked.  I also made 
sure my keychain was unlocked.

Since I did this, I have not had the problem with mail.  Key Chain 
Access is in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder.

Hope this helps,

Renita
