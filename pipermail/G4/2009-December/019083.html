Great story, Ted! I'll keep this info around, just in case.
We still have a couple of older Macs. Good to know.

</I>&gt;<i> purchased a MacBook Air.   I was reading something online and found an
</I>&gt;<i> article saying that Apple was replacing the video card on some previous
</I>&gt;<i> models of MBP.  I pulled it out and called Apple and of course my did not
</I>&gt;<i> have that model video card.  But I went ahead and made a Genius Bar
</I>&gt;<i> appointment.  I am thinking the whole drive (ATL rush hour traffic) to the
</I>&gt;<i> Apple Store that I was wasting my time.  I go in and explain what happened
</I>&gt;<i> and he hooked it up, reproduced the problem, and took it to the back.
</I>&gt;<i> After a while he comes back and says they think it is the LCD screen
</I>&gt;<i> because the screen came on (although white) and the e xternal monitor
</I>&gt;<i> worked.  He tells me about a program I have never heard of before.  For a
</I>&gt;<i> flat fee ($315 for MBP) they send it to Apple Repair and they will repair
</I>&gt;<i> it (no matter how many parts) for the flat rate of $315.  If there is any
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;accidental&quot; damage (drop etc,) they will call you with an estimate for the
</I>&gt;<i> repair.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought it was a no brainer $315 for a computer that is still worth over
</I>&gt;<i> $1,000.  The battery had swelled and he replaced it for free and had me
</I>&gt;<i> sign the paperwork for the new battery.  He enter the repair for the MBP
</I>&gt;<i> and had me sign.  As I am walking out the store, I remembered I did not pay
</I>&gt;<i> him anything.  I go back and ask, don't I need to pay you the $315?  He
</I>&gt;<i> said no the service is on us, because of how he enter the battery
</I>&gt;<i> replacement the service printed out with no charge.  So now I am waiting
</I>&gt;<i> patiently for the MBP to arrive in the AM. (They overnight all the
</I>&gt;<i> shipments.) The repair status actually says &quot;REPAIRED&quot;!!!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Enjoy your Mac....
