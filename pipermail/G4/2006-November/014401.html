I would guess that 350 watts should be the minimum rating you should  
consider.  There's some very good PC power supplies out there, but  
there's also some real crap, so stay away from brands you've never  
heard of.  I've personally been very happy with Antec power supplies,  
but some other reputable names to consider would be Thermaltake, PC  
Power &amp; Cooling, and Enermax.  If you can afford it, overkill won't  
hurt anything (excess capacity is only used when it's needed, so a  
1000watt power supply in your Mac won't use any more electricity than  
a 350 watt one, except that the 350 watt supply will fail before your  
computer draws anywhere near the limits for the larger supply).  I'd  
place more priority on a reputable brand name than on the wattage  
rating, though.

I haven't taken the time to look at any wiring diagrams, but re- 
wiring the PC supply for your Mac should be pretty simple.  I'd like  
to do that myself, but my Mac's power supply isn't dead yet, and I've  
got plenty of other projects...  I *think* the external dimensions of  
the power supply will be the same, but a tape measure can verify  
that.  You can measure your own power supply, and you should be able  
to find dimensions for the PC power supply on the manufacturer's  
website.

Good luck!
