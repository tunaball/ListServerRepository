<PRE>Hello David

This is a long shot, but do you have plenty of spare hard drive  
capacity?

I had this problem a couple of years ago and it turned out to be a  
lack of spare HD space on the system drive. The space was needed for  
the memory manager (formerly virtual memory on pre OSX).

You need about 2 gig spare as a minimum. There was an Apple knowledge  
base article about this, but I have forgotten the details.

When I cleaned out my HD, everything went back to normal including  
the missing mail.
