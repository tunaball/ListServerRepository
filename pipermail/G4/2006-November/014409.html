<PRE>

Charles,

I have a couple of comments.

First, I agree with Robert, it is probably not the PS.

Two, Your reading of 120 on your current PS, is probably 120 volts, NOT
watts.

Finally, again I agree with Robert, consider buying a different machine --
you can get a Mac Mini for about $600. Has the duo OS capability, fast CPU,
all set to go. Plug in your keyboard and monitor, and you are on the air!

My two cents worth.

Rich

Subject: Re: [G4] power supply upgrade

I don't believe it.

I can speak only from personal experience, but suspect that your previous
upgrade is to blame.  Many upgrades to the early G3/G4 Macs required custom
firmware upgrades for installation.  I have one such.  If your 800 MHz
upgrade was one of them, the incompatibility lies with the 800's firmware
being incompatible with the  1.5 GHz; your Mac is an innocent bystander.

*If* this is the case, your simplest route is to sell off your current G4
and purchase another one --the early G4s are selling under $100 on eBay--
and upgrade it.  Alternatively, you would need an Apple firmware upgrade to
reinstall to return your Mac to its pristine state.  Oh, yeah -- you will
need to reinstall the original Apple CPU first.  All using OS 9.
