<PRE>Lets see if I understand you correctly. Your Internet service is  
provided by Quest. However Quest will not provide you with an email  
account? (I would think that very odd). And you have yet another  
third party Internet provider, through whom you do have an email  
account?

If I understand you correctly as stated above. Then you can of course  
receive mail with your third party ISP mail server. However to send  
email you will need to do so through your Quest mail server. But they  
are not providing you a server? Ok, then you must return to your  
third party ISP and tell them Quest does not provide you with a mail  
server. And so you must use the third party's mail server instead and  
they need to allow relaying on their server from the Quest domain for  
your account with them. Good luck with that happening.

The problem is not Apples Email client your using and there is no  
setting to help you out. Since all responsible ISP's refuse relay  
access through their servers. And since Quest doesn't provide you a  
mail server on their domain, then your kind of stuck if the third  
party won't allow you to relay or if Quest won't allow you access to  
their mail servers. So you have a few solutions that are possible.

	A) Use a web mail interface provided by your third party ISP for all  
of your outgoing mail.

	B) See if your third party has an IMAP server you can use instead of  
a SMTP mail server

	C) Install your own mail server and purchase a static IP along with  
a domain name.

I hope I understood your problem clearly
