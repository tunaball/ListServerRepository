<PRE>Hey all:

I just got my first Mac ever, a PowerMac G4 400mhz with 2 harddrives (one
10gb and one 20gb).  And I absolutely love it.  (Its was upgraded by the
previous owner to have 768 ram)  The processor is a bit slow, but its great
other than that. (my old computer was a windows 98 home-build that I helped
put together myself with no sound card - so anything is awesome compared to
that!!)

I have two questions:

One: I'm looking to get an airport original for it from ebay.  Does anyone
have experience in installing one and what has your experience been?  Easy
or hard?  I've never cracked open the computer case yet, so I dont quite
know what I'm gettting myself into.  What type of tools should I need other
than a screwdriver?  Is it anything similar to a pc inside?

Two: I'm also looking to possibly upgrade the processor and harddrive.
Where would I go about looking for the correct hardware for this?  I know it
has to be specifically mac compatible, but does it absolutely have to be
manufactured by Apple?  And is this economical at all - or should I just
leave it as is?  I only paid 100 for the whole computer with 10.3.9 and
keyboard/mouse and speakers plus the 60 or so for the airport.  Is it worth
upgrading?

Thank you for any suggestions-
Erin
