<PRE>I don't believe it.

I can speak only from personal experience, but suspect that your previous
upgrade is to blame.  Many upgrades to the early G3/G4 Macs required custom
firmware upgrades for installation.  I have one such.  If your 800 MHz
upgrade was one of them, the incompatibility lies with the 800's firmware
being incompatible with the  1.5 GHz; your Mac is an innocent bystander.

*If* this is the case, your simplest route is to sell off your current G4
and purchase another one --the early G4s are selling under $100 on eBay--
and upgrade it.  Alternatively, you would need an Apple firmware upgrade to
reinstall to return your Mac to its pristine state.  Oh, yeah -- you will
need to reinstall the original Apple CPU first.  All using OS 9.
