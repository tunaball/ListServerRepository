<PRE>Hello all,

I am back again. I'm starting to think I have a serious logic board problem, as this doesn't make sense to me.

Put in OSX gauranteed compataible 512 memory stick. Nothing. Install still hangs early on.

Put in a SIIS ultra ATA 133 Raid controller for MAc, compatable with G4's. (The machine doesn't see the card on the Apple profiler?)
Also put in a WD 80 gig ATA harddrive. Well, since the card isn't reading, the disk is not mounting.

Now I did put in a new battery and I did reset the PMU and I have reset the PRAM.
I am going to try another new battery, and another PMU reset, because the clock continually resets to 1/1/1904. And other than the battery I can't imagine what is off here.

Could I have a bad logic board? Why then does it load 9.2 and run seemingly without problem?

Going to try the ATA card in some of the other PCI slots, in the event I have some bad PCI slots.

This machine is a conundrum.



&gt;<i> Why won't OS X install? I have a Sawtooth and have had OS X running on it on and off since 10.1, 
</I>&gt;<i> and full time since 10.2. Unless there's something wrong with the machine or it has a 
</I>&gt;<i> ridiculously small amount of memory or disk space, OS X should run on it just fine. That's the 
</I>&gt;<i> first thing you need to figure out, and then worry about upgrades. If OS X doesn't run now and 
</I>&gt;<i> it's not because of memory or disk space, an upgrade probably won't help.
</I>

</PRE>
