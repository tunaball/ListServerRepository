</I>I am not sure what VERY slow means. I have a 350 Sawtooth as well with 
512 RAM and it is pretty darn snappy for most things. I think 256 is 
not enough. Then again, I am not burning DVDs or doing really intense 
processor heavy stuff. I really do wonder though, why the original 
poster is unable to install. Yeah it could be the RAM finicky thing, I 
think the jury is still out on that. But what sort of install CD's are 
being used, is it one of those machine specific installations? Or is is 
a full copy meant for any computer. I have heard mixed reports from 
people who try to install from discs that are bundled with other 
machines. This may have been brought up already but I missed it.
