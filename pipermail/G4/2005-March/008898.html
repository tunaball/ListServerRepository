<PRE>In your multiple reformattings, I assume you tried doing it from the OS 
X install CD, using the option to install OS 9 drivers, and maybe 
journaling.  Even so, after the TechTool experience, I would do it 
again.

After that, memory is the first suspect.  OS X, and 10.3 in particular, 
is fussy about RAM that does not meet specs.  The original 64 is not 
enough by itself to install X.  The other three sticks may not meet 
standards.  I suggest you tell us everything you know and can learn 
about them, brand, where you bought them.  You may have to buy a new 
256 or 512 from a reputable vendor to go with the original 64.  Check 
the web sites for Crucial, maker of most RAM that Apple installs, and 
also OWC (Other World Computing).

</I>&gt;<i> Is even worse now!  It hangs on the opening blue screen with the 
</I>&gt;<i> apple.
</I>&gt;<i> -zapped the PRAM.
</I>&gt;<i> -replaced the battery and reset the PMU.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It always successfully reinstalls 9, up to 9.2.2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any other suggestions would be more than appreciated. I also went

</I>&gt;<i> solutions before posting, but I really couldn't find any successes.
