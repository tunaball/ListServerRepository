Certainly. Almost all airport (aka 802.11) routers can bridge and route 
wireless to wired networks. While the Ethernet side is usually &quot;towards the 
internet,&quot; it works just as well the other way around. At least in 
principle.

&gt;<i> Any hardware reccommendations?
</I>
Apple's hardware can certainly serve. Plug an Airport Express station into 
the wall next to your non-wireless Mac, plug the Mac's Ethernet into it, 
and you're done. The Airport Base Stations don't contain Ethernet hubs 
though(*), so to connect two Macs would require a separate hub ($9.95 at 
your neighborhood computer store). If you have a spare hub sitting around, 
you can use that, of course.

Many third party wireless routers have built-in hubs. They're also cheaper. 
On the other hand, they are often more, uh, interesting to configure.

&gt;<i> Any thing I should look out for?
</I>
Note that Airport Express base stations can extend each others' range as 
well as bridge wired to wireless networks. So depending on how much steel 
and concrete is impeding your reception, this may be a nice side benefit. 
They can only do this with each other though,  not with third party routers.

&gt;<i> I don't know if my wireless is G or B, but I imagine I can figure that
</I>&gt;<i> out by looking at the router.  Do I need to make sure that what ever I
</I>&gt;<i> buy is built for that particular platform?
</I>
Almost all G routers will deal with B clients just fine, and vice versa. 
But you won't get G speeds unless everything on a channel is using G(**). 
So if you want the extra speed, use all G devices. If you don't, any 
mixture will do.

(*) Actually, the Airport Extreme base station has two ethernet ports. But 
it's certainly overkill for this application, unless you need an antenna or 
the built-in modem.

(**) That's a simplification, but it's good enough for casual talk.
