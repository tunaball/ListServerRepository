I would argue that it does reflect their character, as their  
character is influenced by culture, family and education. Thus the  
schooling they've received has contributed to a character of apathy  
towards grammar, and perhaps towards knowledge overall. It seems to  
me that many are content to entrust knowledge to others, more or  
less. I think, Keith, you were agreeing with Tom while thinking it  
was otherwise.

cwick: I hope you will let this show you what impact your use of  
&quot;internet English&quot; has on the communication you wish to convey.  
Choosing to write decently will gain you more respect, pure and  
simple, and you can see that many people don't like deciphering some  
kind of short-hand script. It did annoy me and I wanted you to know  
that. I didn't know whether there would be much discussion of the  
issue, but I do like it now that it's come up.

Language is made up of rules, after all, and the &quot;internet language&quot;  
you use violates the rules and creates a style effect, and not all  
style effects are positive. Just something to be aware of.
