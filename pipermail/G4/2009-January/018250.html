Pardon me, Tom, but...it is NOT &quot;okay&quot; and your passing it off as merely
&quot;symptomatic of young people today&quot; speaks to your acceptance of ever-widening 
mediocrity.

&gt;<i> When I interview candidates for positions where they'll be

</I>&gt;<i> those under the age forty can't write a passable English paragraph. 
</I>
I've experienced that myself.

&gt;<i> This speaks volumes about their character...
</I>
I totally disagree with that statement. Not being able to read and write their 
native language fluently speaks volumes about the schooling they received, and 
very likely reveals parents who have abdicated their review of their kids' 
schoolwork.
How many parents care _why_ their student gets a C or below in their homework? 
Pulling down a C+ or better in MY house kept me from too much criticism, but a 
C- or worse brought on the inquisition!

&gt;<i> ...and is the reason we off-shore half of our technical reports. 
</I>
Absolutely so. Any technical report produced by your company of work it has done 
must be as free from error as the work it supports or about which it reports. 
Otherwise it calls into doubt the capability of the company to perform 
error-free work in the first place.

&gt;<i> Respect, honor, and pride are vanishing in the US.
</I>
I have held that opinion for some time now. I agree with your indictment.

&gt;<i> Happy New Year!  :-/
</I>
And to you, sir, and many more to come!
