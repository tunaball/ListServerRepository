<PRE>Hey, you are lucky enough that both your machines are faster G4s and you are 
using the very latest OS!!  So you will more than likely receive a dozen 
replies to your question.

My question concerning network printing between an old ratty G4 Yikes 350 
and a beige G3 got NARY an answer.  I wonder--is there such a thing as Apple 
Yuppie Snobs who forget that they once had &quot;inferior&quot; machines??  NAaaa....

Subject: [G4] 2 machines, 2 different problems
Date: Fri, 21 May 2004 17:46:10 -0400

I have 2 problems with OS-X 10.3.3

Machine 1 a G4 tower:
I can't access the root level on the startup drive. It's owned by System and
Admin users can read only. All other machines I have running X allow Admin
users read/write privileges. This means some installers don't work because
they can't access the root level.

This is the only machine with this problem. The other machines I have access
to allow Admin users read/write access. I'm sure I'll have to do some
Terminal command to fix it as the normal maintenance/repair procedures
didn't work. All machines are running 10.3.3 with the latest patches from
Apple.


Machine 2 G4 PowerBook:
The windows don't seem to remember the Icon placement nor settings to keep
arranged by name. The global settings for Icon view are &quot;Keep arranged by
name&quot; this setting doesn't change. But when the Applications folder and
Utilities folder are opened they revert to &quot;this window only settings and
the icons, window size, etc. are all messed up. Window placement is off etc.
If I set window view options back to global they stay for a while, usually
the next reboot. If I set the &quot;This window only&quot; settings to keep...by name
placement will also foul up after a while.

Either way settings don't seem to keep after a restart. I've run the usual
maintenance routines on the PB but it didn&#185;t help. Nor did deleting the
invisible .DS_store files inside each folder. I know there was a preference
file to delete to cure this oddity but when I read the articles I didn't
have the problem. Of course I didn't save the info nor remember where I read
it. Anybody know the cure?

TIA
John
