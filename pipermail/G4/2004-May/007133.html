<PRE>Good news!  I've been able to re-install Internet Explorer and 
everything is working fine now.  The solution, I am ashamed admit as 
I should have known better and done it sooner, was to:

1.  Run TechTool disk repair and rebuild desk top.  That didn't 
really do the job this time even though it has done wonders in the 
past.  I ended up with blocked applications that wouldn't even open 
so I was worse off than before.

2.  Run Disk Warrier to &quot;Rebuild the startup disk directory&quot;.  That 
one worked like gangbusters.  I was able to re-install Explorer and 
everything now is back to normal.  This has been a lesson to me; 
when something peculiar is going on with no explanation for it, use 
the utilities to clean up the hard drive.  Something to remember.

According to &lt;<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.aspx#IE">http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.aspx#IE</A>&gt;, Internet
Explorer 5.1.6 for Mac OS 8.1 to 9.x is the latest for non-Mac OS X. I
don't know why you'd get anything about privileges trying to install
anything in OS 9. AFAIK, privileges are unique to OS X.

[The above download site shows I.E. v.5.1.7, which is what I used.  JD]

As for Netscape, 4.8 is the best one for OS 9+. Get it at
&lt;<A HREF="http://wp.netscape.com/download/archive/client_archive47x.html">http://wp.netscape.com/download/archive/client_archive47x.html</A>&gt;.

[I have Netscape 7.02 installed for OS 9.2.2 and it seems to work OK
but I seldom use it because the I.E. seems easier to use.  I recall 
problems with Netscape, that it could not open certain sites that 
I.E. had no problem with.  I was told that some Microsoft programs 
for building web sites were not very friendly to Netscape browsers.
