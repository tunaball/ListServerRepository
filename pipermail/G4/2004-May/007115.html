Anne:

The clean install is what you did with the Archive and Install that you
mentioned in another thread:  Previous System Folder....

Archive and Install is now generally recognized as the most stable and
effective choice.  Most people who have moved from Jaguar to Panther are
happy they did; few have gone back.

OS 9.2.2?  Most definitely, do it.  There are &quot;read me&quot; documents with each
for hot to do it.

Partition.  There are many valid reasons and opinions pro and con.  They
usually depend on one's individual circumstances.  On my QuickSilver 733, I
had 9 volumes spread over two internal hard drives.  That was fine.  I am
just now in the midst of reorganizing and simplifying things and will end up
with 4 volumes.  One drive will have one single volume for OS X Panther and
all documents and applications that come under OS X.  This volume will also
have a Classic 9.2.2 System Folder.  The other drive will have a bootable
(startup) OS 9.2.2 volume, an OS X Emergency volume, and a Scratch volume
for Photoshop Elements.  The 9.2.2 startup volume will hold all legacy
applications and documents.  It will also have a folder to let me hold a
backup copy of my OS X Home folder and whatever else I might decide to
backup there from the OS X drive.  And vice versa, the OS X Home folder in
Documents will have a folder to hold backup copy of the OS 9.2.2 documents.
I still occasionally will backup to CD-ROM.

Last month, I generated questions in two threads about partitioning on the X
Newbies list.  I've noticed you use that list also.  I am taking the liberty
of sending you my archived copy of the two threads.  These were the best
discussions on partitioning that I have seen on several lists over the past
few years.

For step by step in partitioning, I went to Apple's Support tab at their web
site and typed &quot;partitions&quot; in the search box.  That gave two excellent
articles.  I recommend you print them.

<A HREF="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61301">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61301</A>
<A HREF="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=152061">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=152061</A>

&gt;<i> I need how-tos and information to help me evaluate whether and when. If
</I>&gt;<i> I update
</I>&gt;<i> to 10.2.8, will my HP4400C scanner still work? - I note from their site
</I>&gt;<i> there are still
</I>&gt;<i> as of yet no OSX drivers. My Palm 500? Etc. Is there an easier way to
</I>&gt;<i> get one's settings
</I>&gt;<i> back? (I have taken extensive notes from my present episode, which will
</I>&gt;<i> help with any
</I>&gt;<i> future ones.)
</I>
Printer and Palm.  I cannot help.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I need to do better backups. I'm doing fine with documents, but I let
</I>&gt;<i> the whole system
</I>&gt;<i> backup wait too long. (It was very time-consuming.) How do I learn more
</I>&gt;<i> about Dantz
</I>&gt;<i> Retrospect, in terms of evaluating the best backup procedure for me? Go
</I>&gt;<i> to their site,
</I>&gt;<i> of course ... I also feel the whole system backup was prolly
</I>&gt;<i> compromised by whatever
</I>&gt;<i> problem I had, and would like to start over. I now know how to use it
</I>&gt;<i> better. 
</I>
If you are now happy with Retrospect, fine.  If not, check out Carbon Copy
Cloner (CCC) at <A HREF="http://www.bombich.com/">http://www.bombich.com/</A>
I have not used either Retrospect or CCC.  But I understand CCC is simpler
to use and still quite flexible in what it does.

Good luck,
