<PRE>So I'm upgrading my sons Beige G4, 466 MHz, 512 MB, Radeon 7000, OS 
9.2.2.  I put OS 10.2.6 on it too and installed both firewire and USB 
cards.  They work fine in X but not in 9.  I was told to reinstall 9.  
Did that and it was OK until going through the upgrade process when I 
got to 9.2.1 the installer said I had to turn off the extensions 
because of a conflict with an ATI driver.  So I turned that off and 
while loading it stops saying there is a system conflict but it does 
not identify it.  This may have been caused by my transfering all of 
the extensions from the original 9.2.2 that was already on the hard 
drive.  Now when I reinstalled 9, the USB ports worked, but when I try 
to use the original 9.2.2 I get a warning saying, &quot;Software needed for 
USB device &quot;M4848&quot; is not available.  Would you like to look for the 
item on the internet?&quot; When I hit yes it tries for a while but then a 
dialog box says, &quot;Software update is not able to connect to the 
internet.  Check configuration.&quot;  But I connect to the net fine with IE 
in that system and when I use software update in the control panels I 
get the dialog box say, &quot;Your software does not need updating.&quot;

Looking at both 9 system I see all of the same USB extensions but the 
newly installed one works and the original one does not work with USB.  
If I knew what was in in the new install that allowed the function of 
USB I could transfer it from the new system to the original on and 
trash the new install that has the conflicts.

Anyone have an idea what to do?

TIA,
        Anand
