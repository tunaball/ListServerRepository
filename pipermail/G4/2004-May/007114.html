Forget Jaguar and go directly to Panther, assuming the Macs have the 
memory &amp; processor for it (yours does, but what about your dad's?)

Partitioning is a personal choice. Some swear that it is mandatory 
but others don't. I look at it this way: if separate partitions are 
better than 1, then that is the way Apple would set up the computers 
from the factory. Basically it is more of a convenience thing. My old 
Bondi iMac is partitioned due to the 8 GB limit; my G4 iMac is not 
partitioned.

&gt;<i>I need how-tos and information to help me evaluate whether and when.

I had a problem with Palm Desktop when I upgraded to Jaguar. 
Supposedly PalmSource has posted a patch/upgrade to fix it. However, 
by enabling root and reinstalling the Palm Desktop software while 
logged in as root, fixed the problem for me.



&gt;<i>Also, I should
</I>&gt;<i>update the OS9 to 9.2.2, but on a dialup this is frightfully slow, so prolly
</I>&gt;<i>need to get my brother to d/l on his fast connex on Windows and mail 
</I>&gt;<i>me a CD. Will
</I>&gt;<i>this work? It did for OS9.1 for the laptop. Will this work for the 
</I>&gt;<i>10.2.8 update?
</I>
If you buy Panther, you can send in a proof-of-purchase card and get 
9.2.2 on cd for just the price of shipping.
