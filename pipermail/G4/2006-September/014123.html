<PRE>Greetings ( + )!( + )

David, thank you so much, this is much more like I'm sure must of us 
would like to hear, I really didn't take your last answer as being a 
smart @!~ I just felt like you were talking down to me.

I forgot to mention that the first computer system that I worked on was 
in 1962 which was a missile guidance computer system which was 
comprised of a digital system and an analog system.

The analog system was used to test and analyze the digital the systems 
ability to guide a missile accurately to the target. This system was a 
very, very large physically and consisted of lots and lots of relays, 
transistors and discrete components. I'm sure that the average desktop 
computer of today could run rings around that system.

Again thanks for this answer, if others have comments and or 
suggestions reading different cards please post to this topic. I'm not 
very much interested in games I just want something that will display 
the information and graphics faster.
