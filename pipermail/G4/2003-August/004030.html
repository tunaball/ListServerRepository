Thanks go to everybody who gave their suggestions on this one.

I've ended up just using Photoshop.  The original &quot;form&quot; got 
rasterized, but I found that as long as I didn't rasterize text which I 
added, it remained in vector form and was still sharp when I did the 
&quot;Save as PDF&quot; in the print dialog.  With a little tweaking, I got the 
file size down to just over 800K per page (the original file was 75K).  
I sent the original file to a friend that has Illustrator, and it 
opened perfectly.  It appears that Illustrator would have been the 
ideal solution here, (assuming that the &quot;Print to PDF&quot; function works 
in Illustrator the same as Photoshop (and _almost_ all other OS X 
apps!)) but I'm not willing to spend that much at the moment.

Jason Anthony:  Although Freehand can open PDFs, it totally mangled 
this one - the formatting was all off and there was text everywhere.  A 
complete mess.  Thanks for the suggestion, though.  It got me going 
down the Illustrator path.

Oh, and I was wrong on the pricing of Acrobat Standard - it's USD$299 
not $100.  Acrobat Professional is USD$449.

Thanks again.  Crisis over.  (it was a job application, by the way ;-)
