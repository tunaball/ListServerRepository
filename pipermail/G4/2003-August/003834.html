<PRE>Mr. Jobs and a developer demonstrated porting 32-bit applications to 
64-bit in a matter of minutes during his historic June 23rd SteveNote. 
It is from that presentation that I derived the idea that it is easy 
and quick to port applications to 64-bitness. Is that not what he told 
us? If you can't remember that part of the address, I will be happy to 
look it up and quote what was said. I have the whole thing on my hard 
drive.
