</I>One of the very first things I discovered when I started in advertising 
in New York was that just about everyone thinks he or she knows how to 
create ads. In the 30+ years since, I've sat through hundreds of focus 
groups in which respondents, probably much like yourself, would 
invariably disagree on what's right and/or best. Consensus is 
incredibly rare. After looking at an execution, you might well opine 
that it &quot;stinks to high heaven.&quot; But you shouldn't be surprised if 
someone cross the table thinks it's the best thing he/she has ever seen.

Chiat/Day does happen to be one of the most respected agencies in the 
world. And you can bet they've done their homework and undoubtedly know 
more about the market situation than the average Mac user. What bothers 
me most about the spot you've referred to is that it rips off a Maxell 
tape campaign done by Scali, McCabe, Sloves some 20 years ago. That's 
something I find far more unforgivable by a top agency. They should be 
most ashamed of themselves.

&gt;<i> Here in California, we were supposed to start testing our high school
</I>&gt;<i> students for proficiency before graduating them and giving them their 
</I>&gt;<i> diplomas....
</I>Glad you got that off your chest?
