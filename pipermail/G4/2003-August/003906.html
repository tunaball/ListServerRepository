&lt;&lt; Actually, Apple has hired one of the most effective and well respected PR
firms (Edelman Worldwide) and Advertising Agenices (Chiat/Day) in the world.

That company may be &quot;one of the most effective and well respected&quot; 
advertising companies in the world, but their product stinks to high heaven.

An effective advertisement campaign certainly does not alienate the 
established user base with &quot;dumbed-down&quot; visuals and/or irrelevant dialogue. You don't 
expect anybody to actually buy a G5 because it can blow a user through three 
walls of his house and not cause any visible injury, do you? Or, that his wife 
would be standing there with her mouth open in surprise and not screaming her 
head off in terror? My dogs would have been long gone, running for their 
lives, if an explosion occurred in the house. Then, to top everything off, there's 
not even a cloud of dust near the G5 and the monitor is still standing upright.

Come on, now! Let's be a bit more realistic and intelligent in our acceptance 
of advertising products. But.... that just may be a bit too much to expect 
from the average American public. I know that Hollywood is Hollywood, but please 
don't insult me by putting me in with the mass of ignorance that we call the 
public.

Here in California, we were supposed to start testing our high school 
students for proficiency before graduating them and giving them their diplomas. That 
testing program just got put on the back burner, postponed for another year at 
least, because at least 20% of this year's graduating students have already 
failed the priliminary testing and the schools do not believe that they can 
learn the required material quickly enough to pass the proficiency test by next 
June.

'Nuff said?
