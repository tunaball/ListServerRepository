<PRE>Howdy!

I presently have a G4/533DP with a 30GB IBM 5400rpm drive (main) and a 
60GB 7200rpm drive, also IBM, piggybacked on it as a media unit.

Due to the recent flurry of hard drive rebates, I now also own two 
Maxtor 80GB 7.2k drives and a WD 120GB unit (also 7.2k rpm).  Being as 
I own these, I figured I might as well put them in my machine as they 
are otherwise not doing much.

What I would like to do, if all goes well, is turn the 60 gig unit into 
my main drive, the 120 into my &quot;fooling around&quot; media drive, and the 
two 80's into a 160GB RAID, via a handy card I also recently bought.  
The 30 would likely migrate into an old PowerMac 6500/275 that needs a 
new drive.

What I am wondering is:  Does anyone have any advice for this operation?

I downloaded a piece of software called Carbon Copy Cloner, that seems 
to get mentioned here and on the DV list allot.  Is this sufficient for 
porting all my system files over to the 60?  Should this be as easy as 
copying everything as it sits on the 30 to the 60 and then removing the 
30 while resetting the 60 as the master drive?  I've got allot of 
software that would otherwise be a real hassle to reinstall and/or 
re-update....

Also, does anyone know of any good specialty brackets that are used for 
mounting multiple hard drives in a fairly small space?

And finally, will four large 7200 rpm drives be a heat problem in the 
confines of a G4 tower?

Any advice from folks who have been there, or are there, or know what 
needs knowing would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Alex
