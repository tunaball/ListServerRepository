<PRE>The Rockford Files kicked =)

The bottomline to this whole discussion is:
Apple is trying to sell computers and they don't do a very good job of it.

The obvious blatent point that hasn't been brought up is simply:
If they understood their product, who their product appeals to, and what
THOSE people are looking for in a product. Then simply they wouldn't need
to call.

The profits in business are made from understanding your customer base and
putting the right product within easy enough reach so they feel like they
got a great deal. If you do that, you don't have to call because you can
tell by your sales charts.

The hard part is trying to find this point or how to manuever yoruself
into a position without devaluing your product to put yourself into this
position after you screw up initially.

Honestly, the fact that they are calling means they missed. I don't think
they missed the top of the line, but they totally fucked up the heart and
soul which is the mid, low end machines. You put dual procs in those
machines with that price point.

You get rid of the castration on the low-end, put a single proc 1.2-1.4
Ghz (which would be chips that would get thrown out) and sell it for a 1k
you have a winner. It is pretty simple actually.

&lt;/marketing 101&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My phone is breaking up - what a pile of crap.  Apple uses ground lines
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and where did this info come from and etc etc etc.  It was a prank (bet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if you try the # back it is not Apple).  Now they know you got a Mac
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and where you live and your name and that you will probably have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $4000 computer delivered in a few months.  They would have hit the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jackpot if you had told them you ordered one -but luckily you did not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Next time someone you don't know calls on odd pretexts and does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answer your questions tell them to get lost and be very agressive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -press them til they explain themselves or hang up.  Scams really tick
