<PRE>Just shows you how times have changed, Joe. I once was asked by the 
postal authorities to facilitate the sorting of the vast numbers of 
return envelopes used by the corporation I worked for. After 
deliberating with the envelope manufacturer and the postal authority we 
all decided in the interests of economy that the best option would be 
to have a black stripe running diagonally across the lower left corner 
of the envelope.

. Well, we were flooded with correspondence from irate customers who 
wrote such comments as: &quot;funereal&quot;, &quot;I'm not dead yet&quot;, &quot; does this 
signal the end of xxxx ? &quot; etc., etc.

  I wonder when my G5 Black Box arrives, should I seize the opportunity 
to finally get in some retaliatory whacks with similar comments to 
those at Apple who opted for the cursed Black Box ? &lt;s&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Well, you could say it's because all the end users who actually

</I>&gt;<i> structural damage to their homes or places of work. (Pity the ones on
</I>&gt;<i> the upper floors of tall buildings).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      My theory is that Apple forgot to include in its &quot;now shipping&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> press release the tiny detail that it meant it had loaded several
</I>&gt;<i> very slow trucks with G5's, treated all the drivers to a big meal
</I>&gt;<i> (but no coffee),  and sent them on their way to distributors on the
</I>&gt;<i> East Coast, Apple Stores, and agencies like the NSA, that are unable
</I>&gt;<i> to talk about anything. And, of course, the DHL plane full of nice,
</I>&gt;<i> black G5 boxes headed for the Falklands Islands Apple Store.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I am surprised that the mere absence of the G5's themselves has
</I>&gt;<i> prevented TheMacintoshGuy, or anyone else, from starting a G5
</I>&gt;<i> list.... after all, look at all the substantive [coughs] discussion
</I>&gt;<i> here on the subject.... from people who don't have one.... yet....
</I>&gt;<i> like me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. Speaking of nice, new, black shipping boxes.... a 12-inch
</I>&gt;<i> PowerBook G4 we ordered for a member of our group a couple of weeks
</I>&gt;<i> ago was mysteriously delayed by one week after an initially early
</I>&gt;<i> ship date. It arrived yesterday, in a black box. The graphics look
</I>&gt;<i> similar to the ones on the G5 box, as portrayed on the Apple homepage
</I>&gt;<i> (I say portrayed, but no one we know has seen a _real_ G5 box,
</I>&gt;<i> right?). I guess the ever style-conscious Apple wants to be certain
</I>&gt;<i> all the boxes in its stores are the same color.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.P.S. Of course, this could suggest another reason for the delay in
</I>&gt;<i> the appearance of the G5's: Apple's waiting until all the Apple
</I>&gt;<i> Stores are repainted black before putting the boxes on display.
