&lt;&lt; Your kiddin right Kunga? That's not a solution when you could potentially

have 50 more of these computers do the same thing. I will be dammed if I am

going to go out and by 50 versions of toast for something that apples

software should do.

I missed the original post of the problem. What is happening with your 
burning? Can you provide a re-post?

Toast is a beautiful program and does all that I ask it to do.

On the second point of the thread,
Why should you expect something from software that has been described as not 
being able to do that? Apple has never said that their CD burning software is 
comparable to Toast, simply an easier way to burn certain types of CDs as long 
as you only want that result.

If I need a particular function, I use a product that will do the job. 
Sometimes cost is a factor, but I try to keep my expenses within reason. I don't buy 
a tool until I verify that I need its function and will use it more than just 
once or twice a year. Once I buy the tool, I keep it maintained and organized 
(clean and current).

On the third point of the thread,
You have 50 of those computers???? I wish I had even one! If you can afford 
that, you should not be quibbling about buying software for them. A 
multiple-site license is cheap enough if you need to do that sort of work, and it is tax 
deductible if it is work-related.
