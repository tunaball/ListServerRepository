<PRE>
A very odd incident occurred yesterday evening. My wife called me to 
the phone as Eric of Apple wished to speak to me. Not having 
communicated in any way with Apple recently, I was intrigued with why 
they would want to phone me. Eric stated: &quot; I hear you're thinking 
about buying a G5 ?&quot; I replied &quot;Yes, you're right about that, at the 
moment I just happen to be thinking about it !&quot;
Naturally, you have thoughts running through your head such as: &quot;where 
did he get this kind of information from ? However, whenever I asked 
such a question, I would hear Eric say &quot; this line is breaking up, I 
couldn't hear what you just said properly.&quot; I wasn't using my cellular 
so any break up must have been caused at his end (?). Since we weren't 
getting anywhere in this kind of scenario, I let Eric know that I have 
a favourite retailer from whom I now buy all things Apple. He replied 
that I should bear in mind that any orders placed now are running two 
to two-and-a-half months late. When I replied that I would bear that in 
mind the connection finally ended with the disconnect sound.

Now, I have no way of knowing whether this was some sort of joke or 
not, but my call display indicated that the call originated from 
Unknown name at 1-916-399-7992, a long distance call from California of 
all places. Since the number of orders for the G5 is such that there is 
a back-log of &gt;2 months, why would Apple see a need to seek additional 
sales by using techniques that, so far as I am concerned, are rather 
extraordinary to say the least ?
