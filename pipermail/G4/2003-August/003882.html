     Couldn't agree with you more, but Apple may have been just as 
amazed as we were at the strength of the pre-orders for the dual 
2.0's, despite all the marketing hype (and the decapitation of the G4 
line). I think at least once in the past, they've gotten burned by 
very high, initial demand by the installed base for a long-awaited, 
new product, only to find the demand tail off sharply after the 
faithful have their product. However valid your reasons for wanting 
to wait and see, it would help Apple's bottom line to be able to 
predict demand accurately.
