<PRE>As I recall, Mr. Jobs said the same thing about Carbonizing when he 
introduced OS X and had an Adobe guy up on the stage saying that 
Photoshop was 95% done. How long did it take Adobe to deliver a 100% 
Carbonized Photoshop? I'm not saying that some programs will not be 
simple to do. But the OS, and many other programs are not trivial. 
Changing from 32 to 64 bit registers can require significant 
architectural changes. If you don't require the precision of 64 bit 
registers, or need an address space larger than 2GB (!) there's not 
even any point in making the effort. When you go in to make changes to 
a program, you might recompile as 64 bit if there are no architectural 
changes required, but since there is not penalty in the hardware or OS 
for running in 32 bit mode, you would not have to.
Mr. Jobs obviously wants to make it all sound very simple, and for some 
(maybe even most) programs it will be, but in engineering, things are 
rarely as simple as a good marketer will make them sound.
