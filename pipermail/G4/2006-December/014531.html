<PRE>Steve,

I have an almost identical QS, including CPU upgrade. A couple things  
to consider here. . .
KPs are generally caused by either 1) hardware incompatibility or  
fault, 2) bad kernel extension software, 3) overheating (see 1)

If you haven't changed your hardware config lately, it could be  
overheating, especially since the dual 1.8 is an overclocked CPU to  
begin with. I had this problem with my GigaDesigns card (purchased  
early this year). The company replaced the card after asking me to do  
a voltage (jumper) change and some additional testing. In my case, I  
run the <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/g4.html">folding at home</A> client software, which maxes out the CPU usage  
24/7. I didn't see any problem with this card until the warmer  
weather appeared, and I wound up setting the card to 1.6 GHz to keep  
it stable. I eventually contacted the company with a description of  
the symptoms and they supplied me with a redesigned card, which has  
performed well and without problem at the rated 1.8 GHz.

Do you run any processor-stressing software such as <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/g4.html">f at h</A>? To explore  
this option further, you could try resetting the clock speed to 1.6,  
and see if the problem persists. If so, I'd start examining other  
possibilities, such as a bad RAM module.

HTH,

Rick
