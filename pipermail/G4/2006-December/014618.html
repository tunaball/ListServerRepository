&gt;<i> Brett,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My G4 (PCI Graphics) has been in almost constant use since I bought it in
</I>&gt;<i> 2000.
</I>
Someone gave me a G4 Sawtooth 400, 384MB! I put 10.3.9 on it and just
upgraded that to 10.4.8. It runs well, if a tad slow, and Photoshop is
hopeless without at least a gig of add'l memory. I will probably upgrade the
DVD ROM to a nice burner some time soon.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have added memory and a USB2 card and a Pioneer 111D DVD burner. I
</I>&gt;<i> also own two Pentium 4 level PCs. However the G4-400mhz is my computer
</I>&gt;<i> of choice. Because it has always done what it was supposed to. My PCs,
</I>&gt;<i> while of ostensibly good quality, are &quot;problematic&quot; and unreliable. I
</I>&gt;<i> blame Windows XP SR2 for that. Windows is simply cheesy.
</I>
In fairness, I have to say that my 3 XP boxes (1 AMD, 2 P4) run beautifully.
I have not had a crash take down the OS for many months. And this is running
a TON of software, from PSCS2/3 to FMP 8.5 and the buggy Corel Painter.
OTOH, I had FlashPlayer hang 10.3.9 to the point where I had to force a
reboot. (Upgrading the Player did fix the problem.) Where the Mac really
does kick butt is in the interface. 10.3.and 10.4 just look gorgeous, even
though I prefer the big CRT that is on the Wintel desktop to the Dell LCD I
bought for the Mac.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will probably install Linux Ubuntu on one of the PCs in the near future.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However the G4 has been great and I imagine that I can use it for the
</I>&gt;<i> next few years. I actually intend to use it until 2010 in one capacity
</I>&gt;<i> or another.
</I>
I put the G4 out in my library where I can cozy up to it and get real work
done. I will use it until it starts to cost too much in repairs. Maybe even
a processor upgrade?

Les
