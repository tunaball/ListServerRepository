</I>&gt;&gt;<i> G4 Sawtooth 400. I have three partitions on my current HD. The boot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partition (10.3.9) is 10GB, of which 5.5 are used. There is also a 9.2.2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partition, which is bootable, and used for Classic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As O'Brien says, yes you will be able to do as you wish. I am just adding
</I>&gt;<i> that you seem to have a misunderstanding of Classic. Classic is OS 9 run
</I>&gt;<i> from within Panther. It is located on your 10.3.9 partition and would still
</I>&gt;<i> be there as usual even if there is no other partition on your HD. The OS 9
</I>&gt;<i> operates on top of the already operating OS X. It can be found on your HD in
</I>&gt;<i> a folder called 'Systems Folder' and has a '9' on the folder icon, whereas
</I>&gt;<i> the folder for OS X is in a folder called simply 'System' and has an 'X' on
</I>&gt;<i> the folder.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many people, however, such as myself, and apparently you as well, have a
</I>&gt;<i> separate partition with OS 9.2 installed on it. This is independent of the
</I>&gt;<i> other partition and is bootable. The only connection from this OS 9
</I>&gt;<i> partition to the Panther side is via a shared folder, often called a Drop
</I>&gt;<i> Box, or other network options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, Panther is capable of utilizing the OS 9 partition as if
</I>&gt;<i> it was just another partition for storing files, but it cannot operate the
</I>&gt;<i> OS 9 applications that are there. Panther can only operate the OS 9 apps
</I>&gt;<i> indirectly by allowing the Classic environment within itself. Because it is
</I>&gt;<i> a long long time since I have had need to use an OS 9 app (I have Quark over
</I>&gt;<i> there, but don't use Quark anymore) and I find OS 9 to be generally an
</I>&gt;<i> unpleasant experience these days and very frustrating to use compared to
</I>&gt;<i> Panther, that I just use the OS 9 partition for my iTunes Library. iTunes
</I>&gt;<i> and iPhoto work fine with their Library's on another partition including one
</I>&gt;<i> with OS 9 on it, as they do on any external drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only advantage to having a separate OS 9 partition is that sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> there can be some apps in the Classic environment that have some troubles,
</I>&gt;<i> such as accessing a printer. Apart from that it suits some people to have a
</I>&gt;<i> familiar full OS 9 environment because they like it. If I had my time over I
</I>&gt;<i> would have simply installed OS X and not bothered with the OS 9 partition.
</I>&gt;<i> It is largely useless.
</I>
Wrong on many counts. According to
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/tiger/classic/">http://www.apple.com/support/tiger/classic/</A>&gt;, to run Classic in OS X you must
have a Mac OS 9 System Folder installed on your computer, either on the same
hard disk as Mac OSX, or on another disk or disk partition. Thus, the OP can
use the OS 9 partition for his Classic and not have a Mac OS 9 System Folder on
his Panther volume. I have a bootable OS 9 partition so I can do some things
that require OS9 but aren't supported w/Classic.
