<PRE>With some regret, it&#146;s time to let my fellow brethren
within the mac community know of the retirement of my
aging but trusted copy of Appleworks 6.2.9. In favor
of the latest copy of Pages 2.02 which I have been
learning and using for the last few months! 

The old gal was not at all pleased but has been closed
for the last time. Some time over the holiday, I guess
I&#146;ll pull here off the hard drive , pack her up in her
box and shelve her for a period of time. Then maybe
I&#146;ll entertain bids.

I started using Appleworks, back before she was called
ClarisWorks, I think that the correct spelling,  -
back in the days of my  Apple IIc - how time flies!

In fact, I was using Applework 5 something or was it
6.

When I upgraded to my first Mac, the new software was
by then called ClarisWorks and a couple years after
that Apple Revised the Appleworks brand and I used her
to this day both for personal and business usages. I
must say that for the last year or so I  have been
using  Neo Office for business almost full time. So
the old girl hasn&#146;t been seeing much work.

So when I moved on to Tiger, it followed that iWork
and Pages would enter my life. I must say that Pages
has turned out to be everything that I had hoped
Applework would have been and more! So if I&#146;m able to
get just half the life cycle out of Pages that I got
out of Appleworks - It will have been worth every cent
that I have or will have paid out over the coming 20+
years!

I trust this rant hasn&#146;t been to far off topic...

Otherwise - Here&#146;s hoping all will have a Safe and
Happy Holiday Season!
