<PRE>Greetings ( + )!( + )

I guess some of us just don't worry about it, as I have on my 120Gb 
main drive, a copy of OSX 10.3.9, a copy of OS 9.2.2, a copy of OS 
9.2.1, and a copy of OS 9.0 and I suffer no Ill effects. If I want to 
boot into something other than OSX 10.3.9 I simply go to &quot;System 
Preferences&quot; select &quot;Startup Drive&quot; and then select the Drive/Folder 
that I would like to boot from, then select reboot.

I assume that one of those versions of OS 9.X.X is used by OSX when I 
request the &quot;Classic&quot; mode of operation, and have never had any 
problems, and I have been using OSX now for 4 Years.

</I>&gt;<i> that you seem to have a misunderstanding of Classic. Classic is OS 9 
</I>&gt;<i> run
</I>&gt;<i> from within Panther. It is located on your 10.3.9 partition and would 
</I>&gt;<i> still
</I>&gt;<i> be there as usual even if there is no other partition on your HD. The 
</I>&gt;<i> OS 9
</I>&gt;<i> operates on top of the already operating OS X. It can be found on your 
</I>&gt;<i> HD in
</I>&gt;<i> a folder called 'Systems Folder' and has a '9' on the folder icon, 
</I>&gt;<i> whereas
</I>&gt;<i> the folder for OS X is in a folder called simply 'System' and has an 
</I>&gt;<i> 'X' on
</I>&gt;<i> the folder.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many people, however, such as myself, and apparently you as well, have 
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> separate partition with OS 9.2 installed on it. This is independent of 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> other partition and is bootable. The only connection from this OS 9
</I>&gt;<i> partition to the Panther side is via a shared folder, often called a 
</I>&gt;<i> Drop
</I>&gt;<i> Box, or other network options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, Panther is capable of utilizing the OS 9 partition 
</I>&gt;<i> as if
</I>&gt;<i> it was just another partition for storing files, but it cannot operate 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> OS 9 applications that are there. Panther can only operate the OS 9 
</I>&gt;<i> apps
</I>&gt;<i> indirectly by allowing the Classic environment within itself. Because 
</I>&gt;<i> it is
</I>&gt;<i> a long long time since I have had need to use an OS 9 app (I have 
</I>&gt;<i> Quark over
</I>&gt;<i> there, but don't use Quark anymore) and I find OS 9 to be generally an
</I>&gt;<i> unpleasant experience these days and very frustrating to use compared 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> Panther, that I just use the OS 9 partition for my iTunes Library. 
</I>&gt;<i> iTunes
</I>&gt;<i> and iPhoto work fine with their Library's on another partition 
</I>&gt;<i> including one
</I>&gt;<i> with OS 9 on it, as they do on any external drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only advantage to having a separate OS 9 partition is that 
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> there can be some apps in the Classic environment that have some 
</I>&gt;<i> troubles,
</I>&gt;<i> such as accessing a printer. Apart from that it suits some people to 
</I>&gt;<i> have a
</I>&gt;<i> familiar full OS 9 environment because they like it. If I had my time 
</I>&gt;<i> over I
</I>&gt;<i> would have simply installed OS X and not bothered with the OS 9 
</I>&gt;<i> partition.
</I>&gt;<i> It is largely useless.
