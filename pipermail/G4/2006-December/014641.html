Setting up a network you have a 2 or 3 of options. 

1. Going wireless you will need a wireless card in each computer and a wireless router besides the modem. Some ISP provide 
a  wireless modem which would eliminate the need for a seprate router. The router should have a ethernet connection on it 
in order to configure the router's settings. I Have a Mac G4/400 704 MB on OS 10.3.9 using a Hawkings router that paid $30 
for, and a Motorola Card that was priced right and a PC 1 ghz XP and a linksys card in it. The system works fine. You should 
be Ok at 50 ft.. You can always add a high gain antenna to the router to improve range.. When setting router one should at 
least turn of the SSID that is the name being broadcast by the router which can be seen by anyone search for wireless 
networks. Also the SSID  name should be changed from default.

2. You can use a ethernet network which means you will need cables to run from the computers to the router. The router 
should have at least a couple of ethernet ports to connect the CPU to. Most of them have 1 or 4 ports. This means running 
cables over a distance. 

Netgear has a device that plugs into an electrical wall outlet that uses house wire in place of a ethernet cable. It has a 
ethernet connection you can run a shorter cable to a computer that you want on the network. You can use as many of them 
as necessary to serve your needs. You internet connection can be feed into one of these and all the computers would be 
connected to the internet and to each other.

I hope this is not to confusing, but may help to consider options. You can ask for more info particularly configuring the 
network
