It sounds like the T.Y. discs aren't a good match for that particular 
drive, so there are audible errors when you burn to them, with that 
drive, at 4X.  Try burning some discs at 2X and see if that helps.

You may be able to find different firmware you could flash to the drive 
that would help it work better with the T.Y. discs.

It looks like your drive is made by LG Electronics (formerly Goldstar), 
but I don't see that model listed at lge.com (they don't list GCC-4520B, 
but they do list GCC-4521B).

I found firmware for it at the korean site (<A HREF="http://www.lge.co.kr/">http://www.lge.co.kr/</A>). 
It's v1.01, released 2/6/2004 (or maybe it's 6/2/2004), but I think you 
need Windows to install the firmware, and I can't read the Korean on the 
page, anyway.
You can download it here, in any case:

You can also look here, but I think you'll run into the same issues:
