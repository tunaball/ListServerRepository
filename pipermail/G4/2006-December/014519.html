<PRE>Hi Bill,

Depends on the router, I imagine.

My Linksys has an access restriction panel. I've assigned my son's  
machine a static IP, and using that I'm able to restrict access past  
bedtime while other machines in the house are unaffected. This works  
not only by time of day, but also day of week, and can even go so far  
as to shut off access to certain websites. I find it very helpful.

Another thought is to have the router save access logs. An old one I  
had would email the logs to me. Sometimes showing your child a  
printed list of everywhere he's been is enough to let them know they  
are not getting away with anything.

Hope this helps...
