Buy your ram from someone with a return policy to your liking-that will 
accept returns due to unknown incompatabilities, etc. Apple Ram seems 
to be a bit steep compared to OWC or Macsolutions or nearly any other 
big Ram seller.

Some things that help OSX alot after install- use Pacifist to redo the 
pre-binding after you install the OS and programs. Use DiskWarrior to 
check the disk directly after new install and use Nortons to Optimize 
the disk. It seems that OSX is really messy when you install it and all 
of these measures help clean it up. More speed and more stability.
