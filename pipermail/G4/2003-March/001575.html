Snorksvillanio and other Maccers:

This occurs for me occasionally when and only when I'm real busy in X 
with several apps, but have 9 on for one thing or another that I can't 
yet afford new upgrade on yet (o alas, too many, woe is me...) and I 
forget it's even there.

I think it's a plain and simple crash like in the old pre-Unix 
days--when I overloaded 8.6. I feel like it forgets about being in X 
and 9 feels all wimpy and unloved, and it decides to stage a little 
fainting scene, and while X still shows on the surface, underneath 9 
has walked offstage and the play is over.

X just doesn't realize it yet, so it looks fine but does nothing. For X 
it's as if it's in a bad nightmare, and it is on stage, but can't speak 
because it doesn't know the lines, or is naked at school about to take 
a test on a subject it has never learned...so it freezes in fright.

But maybe that's just MY 9/X.2.4. I dunno. It can also twirl a hula 
hoop WHEN 9 isn't running.

As for setiathome--I'm mean and grumpy and I don't know what it is. 
Maybe if I DID have setiathome----I'd be a happier and more jovial 
person. At least maybe I could JOKE once in a while, or lighten up.

But probably not. I'd just find something else to moan about.

But I DO believe that my explanation is true. And that's all I have to 
say about that.
