<PRE>This is an OS 9.2.2 problem, not OS X. I haven't made the leap yet. 
The problem printer is a LaserWriter Select 360, about 8 or 9 years 
old. I wonder how I can tell if it bit the dust? I've used this old 
printer first with a PowerWave 604/132 under OS 8.1 and then with my 
current G4 under OS 9.2.2. Worked flawlessly all these years. Today, 
all of a sudden, it stopped working. I sent a document to the printer 
(Command-P) as usual, the desktop printer icon displayed the small 
page symbol on its lower left as usual, but instead of flashing it's 
green light to show that it would print, the printer light remained 
steady and I got a finder-warning:
      The document &quot;xxxxxxxxx&quot; failed to print on the printer &quot;LW
      Select 360&quot; because the requested printer could not be found.

Then the fun began. I replaced the printer driver with a good copy 
from a backup. No go. Then I checked all the connections to make sure 
they were tight. Nothing. Then I replaced all printer-related 
software from the backup. Still nothing. Then I dug up the original 
software which came with the printer and reinstalled it. Restarted 
the computer (as I did in the previous steps) but still nothing. I 
can select the printer from the Control Strip and the icon on the 
desktop has the bold black outline indicating that it's selected. I 
cannot select it in the Chooser (nothing shows up in the right-hand 
panel.) I turned the printer off and on many times, and restarted the 
computer several times. The Apple Printer Utility, which I have used 
several times in the past, now tells me that there are no AppleTalk 
zones on my network of three computers, and nothing shows up in the 
&quot;Printers&quot; panel.

Thinking the printer was dead, I disconnected it and hooked up an old 
LaserWriter II NT, selected the proper driver, restarted the computer 
and -- even that one wouldn't work. Could both printers be dead? I 
just don't know what else to do. I could replace this old printer 
with a new one, but something tells me that there's still life in the 
360 and I'd hate to scrap it if it can still work. Any insights?
