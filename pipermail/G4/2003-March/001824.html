<PRE>I would like to know the thoughts anyone on this list may have on the 
PowerBook G4 (12&quot; model), especially if you have one. I work for a 
small publishing company and we prefer G4 towers for most of our ad 
designer production work. However, I find that I need to travel between 
5 different offices, including my home office, splitting my time 
between being our company's chief technical officer, training employees 
and designing ads myself. Do you think that the PowerBook G4 12&quot; has 
enough oomph to be a primary computer, replacing a G4 mini tower?? My 
current machine is a PowerMac G4/400 with 1GB of RAM. The one short 
coming I possibly see with the 12&quot; PowerBook, is it'll only go to 640MB 
of RAM. Our primary applications are Multi-Ad Creator (desktop 
publishing program popular in the newspaper world for advertising 
design), and of course Photoshop. The economy has been especially tough 
in my area with a drought adding to the already uncertain economy, but 
we are ready to start replacing our older machines with MacOS X 
friendly computers, as we now have all of our software in place to be 
MacOS X native.

Joe
