<PRE>RE: Dear Sir, I myself recently replaced a g4 350 sawtooth with this TI 
800 15inch, though not exactly the answer to your question,I really 
think you will be most plesantly surprised by how well mac has worked 
to perfect this equipment, though the performance numbers do not seem 
impressive to read,that is it appears little difference between your 
existing equipment and newer models, I am in awe at the improvement in 
every way by this lap-top,and am quite sure even newer models from this 
are even more amazeing.,, the short story is, I dont think you will be 
disapointed with it,just treat it with care and you should have few 
problems,it has taken me about a month to fully  understand useing osx 
but thats nothing compared to the  microsoft learning curve to me.. 
best wishes and congrates on whatever model you choose.
