<PRE>You could temporarily remove the extra ram for a few days to see if the 
issue continues. I've also had really good luck with catching flaky ram 
using a program set called &quot;gauges&quot; that had a small application called 
RAMometer. Strangely this little program has served well to locate ram 
that was good enough to pass the hardware startup test on the mac while 
defective enough to crash several customer macs (and PC's!). TechTool 
also has a ram tester in it but it never seems to be as accurate in 
locating trouble for me.

I also had an issue on my last Power mac G4 where I had an older CD-ROM 
burner plugged into the pass through port of the power supply where a 
normal person would plug in a monitor. Well I was getting random 
lockups, kernal panics, and RAM errors even with the drive powered down 
and SCSI cable unplugged. It turns out that the power supply in the 
SCSI CD-rom burner was very shaky and as soon as it was removed 
completely the mac never ran better!

Strange stuff indeed.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you all buy Apple RAM or third-party RAM? Reason I ask is Apple
</I>&gt;<i> has suggested some OSX flakiness may be due to the RAM that came
</I>&gt;<i> with the machine (free 128 MB RAM deal from Macwarehouse).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most likely it is the Adaptec 2906 SCSI card or the USB hub, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> just wondering what you all recommend - buy only Apple RAM?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now you want to know what kind of flakiness - seem to be kernel
</I>&gt;<i> panics (command line stuff over GUI, frozen screen). It clears up
</I>&gt;<i> on reboot BUT seems to happen rather too frequently for OSX,
</I>&gt;<i> say twice in one evening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't been in OS X much yet so I can't really tell what is
</I>&gt;<i> going on, even as to frequency of the phenomenon because I've
</I>&gt;<i> only booted into X maybe five times and been on it about an
</I>&gt;<i> hour and a half each time. It is OSX.1 and I am going to upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> it to Jaguar this week so maybe the flakiness will go away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All is fine in OS 9.1.2.
