I  was having the same symptoms with my Quicksilver - several kernel 
panics a day forcing a restart each time.
The problem turned out to be the extra 512 module I ordered when I 
bought the machine in January.
Just sent it back today for a replacement.  Apple support said ram is 
one of the two biggest reasons for kernel panics from their 
experience...I have since bought a another 512 from Datamem.com and it 
works great so far.  BTW, I did a hardware test from the Apple hardware 
testing cd several times and it did not pick up on the problem ram.
Good luck

Liz
