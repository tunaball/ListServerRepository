<PRE>I'm pretty sure this is a hardware issue, since at least part of it 
occurs in OS 9 as well as in OSX, but I've found no mention of it in 
other forums.
I have a G4 933, bought last February, that I use for video, graphics, 
web and other mutimedia work. I'm running OS 10.2.4 (this problem 
existed before the system upgrades.) The IDE 60G internal hard drive has 
four partitions: OSX system (smaller partition), applications, internet 
(web developement, browsers) and the largest partition which I use for 
video clips and the OS 9 system folder. Working between these partitions 
is no problem.

I also have an Adaptec 29160N SCSI controller card which hosts a Fujitsu 
MAF3364L SUN36G 10,000 rpm scsi drive that I would like to use as my 
capture drive, but that has not worked very well. I'm using Premiere 6.5 
as the capture software. I have no problem using the drive as a scratch 
drive, and for video and audio preview files, but if I try to capture 
beyond 10,000 frames (about 5 minutes/400 mb) the capture freezes, I get 
the spining beachball of death, the app turns red in the force quit 
panel, and I end up having to restart, because it causes the finder to 
go into spasms also. If I trash the premiere pref and plist files after 
restarting, I can capture again safely if I keep it under 3 or 4 minutes 
MAYBE. I have no problem capturing to the large partition on the IDE drive.

I get a similar problem if I try to copy files over 400 mb to the scsi 
drive, and that happens whether I'm booted into OSX or 9.2.2. The copy 
proceeds about halfway through, then the beachball, etc. In 9.2.2 the 
whole system freezes. I'm using the latest software drivers/versions for 
the system, the controller card and Adobe Premiere. I have factory 
default settings on the hard drive. I have a second IBM 15,000 rpm SCSI 
drive that I wanted to add to the scsi conroller bus, but I'm holding 
off until I figure out what's going on. Any suggestions on cause and/or 
cure appreciated.

Thank you,

Judy Antipin
