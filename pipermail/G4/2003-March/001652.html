might not like QT6 which you are going to have to pay-up to pro anyway 
aftter you upgrade to FCP3 presuming that you want to edit in X in the 
first place.

You offered one caveat that isn't true. The QT component needed by FCP 
is in the QT 5.0.4 Upgrade which comes with FCP 3. You don't need QT 
Pro 6 to edit in FCP 3. You'll get QT 6 with Jaguar but it doesn't have 
to be upgraded to Pro.
One other note, if you install DVD Studio Pro, QT gets a component 
which allows you to export JPG-2 movies, why did Apple wait so long to 
add this feature to QT? iDVD is doing this anyhow, why not QT?
