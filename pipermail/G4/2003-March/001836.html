&quot;oomph&quot; shouldn't be a problem. Screen size may. the 12&quot; is an 
excellent design were portability is the primary need. If it is going 
to be your
only system I would consider the Tibook. The screen size and greater 
expandability make it a better desktop replacement IMHO. The Ti gives 
you
L3 cache, more screen real-estate, Pc card expandability, maximum 1Gb 
ram, and a better video card.

Of course, you could buy an external monitor for increased workspace, 
wherever it's home base would be.

either way as long as your maxing out the memory you should be ok.

Vern.
