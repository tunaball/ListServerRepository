<PRE>I have a G4 933MHz with 1.5GB of memory and a 60GB hard drive and a 
10GB hard drive mounted internally.  I have OS X on the larger HD and 
OS 9.2.2 on the smaller one.  I recently purchased a 130GB external 
firewire HD from OWC and had planned on using it as a backup to my 
internal HD's.  I partitioned the 130GB HD so that I had a 11.78GB and 
a 100GB partition on which to store the two backups.  I used Carbon 
Copy Cloner v2.1.2 to clone the OS X HD.  The copy went beautifully, 
but when I tried to boot from the external HD, it stalled during the 
boot process and put the following at the left upper portion of my 
screen:

/etc/master.password:No such file or directory
/etc/master.password:No such file or directory
sh-2.05a# ______

I assume this is some sort of UNIX command line, but I do not have the 
foggiest as to what to do with it.  I tried my system administrator 
password, but it didn't work.  I looked on the OS X partition and there 
is an alias called etc in the root directory of the partition, but I 
could not find the actual etc folder.  When I searched for the same 
directory (folder) on my internal HD, it does not show up as being 
present.

Can anyone help me with this, or is there no way to boot from a 
firewire disk?

Sig
