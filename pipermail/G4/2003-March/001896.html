<PRE>Hello,
    I have a G4 933, 512 with SuperDrive and a TiPB 1G, 512 without 
SuperDrive. I recently finished a 38 minute video project on iMovie3 on 
the PB, exported it as QT/full quality DV. I then sent this to my G4 
via AirPort. The transfer was almost instantaneous. I expected it to 
take awhile. When I went to open the file on my G4, I got an error 
message (Clip 12 missing) and (error 128). I repeated the process 
several times after checking my settings. Finally, it opened. When I 
tried to play it, only the first few seconds would play. Then the sound 
went dead and the video continued in jumps that were separated by 
several minutes. It finally finished the whole thing but it took 
forever. I allowed it to continue because I was still puzzled by the 
instant transfer over airport and I thought the odd behavior was part 
of transfer sequence. But when it was over and I tried to play it 
again, it behaved in the same manner. Does anybody know why this 
transferred so badly? I have shared files in this same setup 
successfully in the past.  I am using 10.2.4 without any complaints, QT 
is 6.1.

    Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Jim
