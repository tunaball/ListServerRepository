I am connected via eathernet. Local Appletalk network finds the printer 
and sets up just fine, but attempt to print gets error &quot;printer not 
responding&quot;. Got the latest PPD files for this printer and I cannot 
find anywhere in Print Center to choose different drivers for printers 
except where I choose my PPD match-up.

The router and printer are set to use Dynamic IP choosen by router. The 
router is set to DHCP and the printer to RARP/BOOTP with IP 0.0.0.0 
(dynamic). That seems to be the problem with IP print -the number may 
change.  What is my DNS? I could use it instead of the IP# but I do not 
know what it is exactly. Is DNS a Dynamic Name Server? I have a Print 
Server Name.

Having a hard time figuering it out but am trying different configs for 
printer too, but I cannot afford to screw up its functionality in OS9 
at this time.

Thanks for your reply Lee.
