<PRE>I apologize if I'm confusing everyone about the fact that I'm talking about
one defective unit (my daughter's G4 that was bought for her by
Make-A-Wish), a backup unit we have at home (G3), and the expected arrival
of a new replacement unit (G5).  The only hardware unit that has had a
problem is my daughter's G4.  There is a power regulator (not a surge strip)
already there (we did that after the first hard drive crash over a year
ago), no equipment on top of it or around it.  It has good ventilation and
is on top of a hardwood floor.  

I agree 100%, I'm going to do nothing to rock the boat with Apple's use
their sending her a brand new unit that is a much newer model with more RAM
than she currently has.  Any sacrifice I have to make of additional
equipment that won't transfer is irrelevant.

You may have missed the original post in which I said my greatest concern
was retrieving my daughter's Journal.  My daughter is terminally ill and not
expected to live more than a few months.  This Journal is her work with her
teacher of the past few years to leave something behind for the rest of the
family.  They have been back in it up to disks, but the disk got lost and I
bought an Iomega hard drive to back up the whole system, just a little too
late.  We're already experiencing some hardware problems at that point and
have never successfully been able to do a full backup.

Cindy's medical care has taken priority with my time as well as taking her
to travel to see some people she wanted to see before she dies.  As a result
of this, totally repairing the hardware was never my greatest priority,
unfortunately.  If it weren't for the Journal, I really wouldn't care.

Thank you for your suggestions.

Valerie

Valerie,

Since you are blowing up so many hardware units, you might want to 
consider investing in some sort of power regulator -- not just a surge 
protector -- but something that will regulate the incoming voltage to 
the computer.  Some unit that has a battery in it for power regulation, 
or an auto transformer.  Also the hardware might be failing from over 
heating?  You might want to examine the ventilation of the computer.  
Maybe something is being set on top, or beside it, that prevents the 
computer from getting proper air flow.

By the, I wouldn't rock the boat with Apple. If they have agreed to 
send you a new G5, I wouldn't want to renegogiate anything!  They might 
change their mind! I agree that sure was a nice gesture on Apple's 
part.


Maybe the easiest way to fix your disk problem, is to to retype, or 
reacquire, your daughter's homework.

Good luck.
