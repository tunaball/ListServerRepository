<PRE>Unfortunately they want me to return this computer before they send the new
one.  I'm thinking about calling them and asking if I can give them a credit
card hold, though, so I could do something like that.  I once did that when
they were replacing the hard drive.

If the other computer won't boot up, though, would I still be able to do the
feature you are mentioning?

I appreciate your help!

Valerie

Since Apple's sending a new computer, wait until it arrives, and use the
new Setup Assistant feature. See
