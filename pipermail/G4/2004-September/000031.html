Well, I am in Canada and I imagine your in the US so, $600 CAD prolly 
works out to about a buck and a quarter USD nowadays ; ).  I'll 
definitely check out that site.

Thanks again

I would like to direct your search for a processor upgrade to a vendor 
on eBay that I have purchased items from. His seller name is 
&quot;macsforlife&quot; and he specializes in processor upgrades. If you search 
the eBay site for his seller name, you will be able to see what items 
he is selling.

Currently, he has a Sonnet Encore ST G4 1GHz upgrade listed for 
$210.00US as a &quot;Buy It Now&quot; item with $10.00US shipping cost. The item 
is listed as eBay Item number: 5125128489. He has 5 available and the 
auction expires on 25 Sept 04 at 0600Hrs PDT/US.

I know of him only because I have bought from him through eBay. He has 
a very good feedback record on eBay and ships the products very 
quickly. The ST G4 1GHz processor that I purchased from him was fully 
warranted by Sonnet when I registered it and is guaranteed by them for 
three years from purchase date.

I think that you would be pleased with any item you buy from this 
vendor and certainly will save money by using his services.

An alternative suggestion would be to go directly to Sonnet and buy 
from them via the internet. You will pay more, approximately $75.00 to 
$120.00US, depending on the model you purchase.

Hope this information helps guide you in upgrading.

Ron
