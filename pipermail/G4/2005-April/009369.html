In theory this should have worked. There's any number of things that  
could have gone wrong: a bug in Apple's raid implementation, OS X not  
flushing data to the firewire drives correctly - especially at  
shutdown time, a bad interaction between OS X and the firewire bridge  
firmware, etc. However, with 10.3.9 and up-to-date firmware I would  
expect this set up to pass this test. One thing that you could try is  
to always explicitly unmount the firewire drives before shutting down.


&gt;<i> I was wondering, if the drive I had disconnected could not be

</I>&gt;<i> able to get the file off the one drive? Or would I have to get a  
</I>&gt;<i> new drive and rebuild the array to get the file.
</I>
The remaining drive should be able to keep running on its own. When  
the failed drive is replaced you should be able to rebuild the array  
with the RAID software.
