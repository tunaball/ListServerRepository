<PRE>so i went with linksys's wet54g v2 , because that's what the guy at
microcenter told me to buy.

i've had the thing running.   I used this:
<A HREF="http://plantphys.info/advice/WET54G.html">http://plantphys.info/advice/WET54G.html</A>

Problem is, my roommate came home to discover I turned off the WEP.  I
didn't realize I had done so, but I had.  Now I've reinstated the WEP
encryption and now I can't get connected again.

Anyone know what I am doing wrong or have any suggestions or want to
come by my house and make it all better?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm looking for a way to connect my two non-wireless Macs to my

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like to be able to plug both of these macs into a router which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be connected wirelessly to the existing wireless network.  My
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasoning is that I'd prefer not to drill any more holes in my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; landlords floor and the modem and wireless rotor are on the second
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; floor whereas I occupy the third floor.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess I could buy wireless cards for these two machines, but I like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the idea of having a hub that I could plug a couple of other machines
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into if the need arised.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this possible?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly. Almost all airport (aka 802.11) routers can bridge and route
</I>&gt;<i> wireless to wired networks. While the Ethernet side is usually &quot;towards the
</I>&gt;<i> internet,&quot; it works just as well the other way around. At least in
</I>&gt;<i> principle.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any hardware reccommendations?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple's hardware can certainly serve. Plug an Airport Express station into
</I>&gt;<i> the wall next to your non-wireless Mac, plug the Mac's Ethernet into it,
</I>&gt;<i> and you're done. The Airport Base Stations don't contain Ethernet hubs
</I>&gt;<i> though(*), so to connect two Macs would require a separate hub ($9.95 at
</I>&gt;<i> your neighborhood computer store). If you have a spare hub sitting around,
</I>&gt;<i> you can use that, of course.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many third party wireless routers have built-in hubs. They're also cheaper.
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, they are often more, uh, interesting to configure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any thing I should look out for?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that Airport Express base stations can extend each others' range as
</I>&gt;<i> well as bridge wired to wireless networks. So depending on how much steel
</I>&gt;<i> and concrete is impeding your reception, this may be a nice side benefit.
</I>&gt;<i> They can only do this with each other though,  not with third party routers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know if my wireless is G or B, but I imagine I can figure that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out by looking at the router.  Do I need to make sure that what ever I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; buy is built for that particular platform?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Almost all G routers will deal with B clients just fine, and vice versa.
</I>&gt;<i> But you won't get G speeds unless everything on a channel is using G(**).
</I>&gt;<i> So if you want the extra speed, use all G devices. If you don't, any
</I>&gt;<i> mixture will do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (*) Actually, the Airport Extreme base station has two ethernet ports. But
</I>&gt;<i> it's certainly overkill for this application, unless you need an antenna or
</I>&gt;<i> the built-in modem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (**) That's a simplification, but it's good enough for casual talk.
