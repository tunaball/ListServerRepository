</I>Setting it up is easy.
All I did was put the Serial ATA card in a PCI slot. Most cards allow 
two internal drives (OR you could choose two external drives, but have 
to buy a case for them).
I installed the pair of drives into the drive bays under the DVD/CD 
bays.
I left the original 80 GB in the stock bay, since I did not want to 
even mess with the ATA drives anymore. I only use the original 80 GB 
for back up storage of my OS.
Once you install the drives (and card) and boot up, just run Disk 
Utility, choose to set up RAID, choose STRIPE and let 'er rip.
STRIPE combines the two drives as one, and writes half the data write 
to one, and half to the other, but since it is essentially writing at 
the same time, it takes less total time to complete a write.
ATA 66 vs 100 has to do with the speed of the data path.
Hope this helps,
Good luck,
John
