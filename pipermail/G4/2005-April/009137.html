<PRE>	I have a few questions about using RAIDS in my G4.  I started with a 
120 GB hard drive.  I partitioned as follows. 10 GB with OS 9.2.2 
installed, 80 GB with Panther installed, and the rest I use for 
recording to with my TV card.

	I recently added 2 40 GB ATA drives that I set up in a Striped RAID.  
I did a new install of Panther on it and have been using that as my 
primary drive for a few weeks now.  However, when I have to do the 
occasional PRAM zap (to fix a recurring problem with my TV card), the 
system reboots in OS 9.2.2.  Then I have to go into the control panel 
to change my start up disk.  For some reason  the system folder on my 
RAID doesn't show up.  I have to boot into my old Panther folder, then 
select my RAID folder and reboot into it.

	If I was to erase my old Panther system folder, would I be able to 
boot from my RAID after doing a PRAM zap?  Also, is it possible to 
erase the 80 GB partition and add it to my striped RAID as a mirrored 
RAID with out having to reinstall Panther?  I would like to use that as 
a way of constantly backing up my system.

	So, I guess the final configuration would be 2 40 GB drives in a 
striped RAID, an 80 GB partition from a third drive as a mirror of the 
striped RAID, and a 10 GB classic partition and a 20 GB extra 
partition.


Thanks,

Kevin
