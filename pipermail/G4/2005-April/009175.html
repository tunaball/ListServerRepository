<PRE>I am new to this list, but not to the Mac.  I have owned Macs since 
1987.

I need some advice on removing the original 20GB drive from my Sawtooth.

About a year ago I added an internal 120GB hard drive to my Sawtooth 
(an IBM Deskstar).  The current configuration is: the original 20GB 
drive sits where it has always sat, on the bottom of the case; it is 
first in the ribbon cable chain (ATA chain?).  The 120GB drive sits on 
top of it, and is second in the ribbon cable chain.  When I installed 
the larger drive, I switched the jumpers on the drives so that the 
120GB drive is the master, and the 20GB is the slave.

I would now like to replace the original 20GB drive with another 120GB 
Hitachi Deskstar internal drive that I purchased.  But I have run into 
two problems/questions.  When I opened up my case, and removed the 
120GB IBM drive to get to the 20GB drive, I discovered that the 20GB 
drive was not secured to the bracket by screws, but yet would not budge 
when I tried to remove it.  I didn't want to pull on it too much.  Is 
it held in place by adhesive, another screw, or is it just a little 
tight?  Please advise me as to whether I can just pull harder to get 
the drive out, or if there's something else I should do.

Secondly, the new drive does not have jumpers that are accessible.  The 
area where the jumpers appear on my other 120GB drive (between the 
power cable connector and the ribbon cable connector) is covered on the 
new 120GB drive.  Does the drive not need jumpers, or do I need to open 
it up to access them?

I can post particulars about the drives, and/or pictures, if necessary.

Any help will be appreciated.
