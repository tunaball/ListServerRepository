<PRE>Yes, do it not now, but yesterday, before disaster.

There are lots of options available, depending on how you use your 
computer.  I was a big fan of lots of partitions on my two drives in 
the bad old days of OS 8 and OS 9.  Now with OS X, I have everything 
that I can possibly want to work with on my Main Drive with no 
partitions there.  The idea is to let OS X manage the allocation of 
space, clean up the fragmention, and otherwise manage the file 
integrity as it is designed to do.  I understand that OS X will not 
manage files on secondary drive that same way.

My OS 9.2.2 for Classic and for occasional startup is happy with that.  
All my old OS 9 applications and documents are happy there, and 
everything I do with OS X is happy to.  One thing, I had to move my old 
documents into my new home folder.  Just dragged them over.

My second drive has three partitions.  One for backing up my Home 
Folder, that automatically includes the e-mail.  One for Photoshop 
scratch space.  One for OS X Emergency startup and testing.
