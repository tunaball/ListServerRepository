I strongly disagree. It means EXACTLY THAT. &quot;All that money?&quot; What &quot;All

money&quot;??!!!

Waiting for a perfect Tiger is like waiting for a perfect life. Tiger 
is totally stable and will dazzle you with its benefits immediately. 
Buy it tomorrow Anne and install it tomorrow night directly from 
Jaguar. Ron reads like he is truly unappreciative of all the hard work 
being done for his benefit in Cupertino. I for one am not.

Well, Kunga,
(My apologies to the rest of the list, but I was insulted by his 
statement about me.)

I suppose that some people have enough money laying around their houses 
that they are never concerned about their spending habits. I, for one, 
am in the position of being old enough to be retired and that means 
that my financial status is not as great as it used to be and I have to 
be aware of my spending. I also believe that others should have a care 
about their own financial means and not over-extend themselves, but 
that is a somewhat private concept.

Do you believe that $129 does not mean very much for only a sub-level 
upgrade? We aren't even getting a full version upgrade for that sum. If 
we were getting something that compared to the upgrade from version 
7.5.3 to version 8.0, or from 8.6 to 9.0, then it might be completely 
worth that amount. However, the decimal numbers indicate that the 
upgrade is only a sub-level upgrade at this stage. Plus, do we all want 
each of the whiz-bang gadgets that are being touted by Apple? Is it 
really worth it if parts will never be used?

Now, let's do some number addition, okay?

What did the original OS-X cost? $119, if my old-timer's memory is 
holding together. Then there was another $119 for each &quot;upgrade&quot; of 
OS-X, once for OS-X.2 and again for OS-X.3. What number have you added 
up so far? Now, Apple is selling OS-X.4 for another $129. If my 
calculator is not running on dead batteries, my total cost so far for 
OS-X has been in excess of $350 and I haven't even gotten my copy of 
Tiger yet. Next week, my total costs for OS-X will exceed $475 so far. 
What did you pay for these versions? Did you get it for free because of 
some undisclosed circumstance that the rest of us do not share?

Are you completely positive that OS-X.4 is &quot;totally stable and will 
dazzle you.....immediately&quot;? Perhaps you have been in the position of a 
Beta/Alpha tester and have every possible configuration of Mac at your 
house for testing and can therefore make that statement as a proven 
fact? Did you test it with my Mac, or maybe with Anne's, and therefore 
can make that absolute statement?

In any event, I have certainly supported Apple through my usage of OS-X 
and intend to continue to do so when my wallet permits. My advice to 
Anne was intended as a suggestion for making a decision with all 
circumstances being considered before the decision be made. If she and 
I have to watch our spending because of circumstances, so be it, but do 
not denigrate us for not being as rich and spendful as some others.

I do want to thank you for all your past (and future) submissions to 
the list. I have enjoyed the most of them and look forward to more 
education about the Mac through my participation in this list. It is 
through this type of process that many are educated and given 
opportunities that would not come from any other source.

Ron
