I am on v10.2.8 and thinking the best thing might be to see how stable 
Tiger is and just go right for that, in a couple months. Any downsides?

The real downside is for the distributors of OS X.4. They won't get 
your extra $129 for v10.3.

Other than that, as long as you have been operating without the 
benefits of v10.3 and not having problems, you can't complain about 
missing the advantages of it over v10.2. You will have a little bit 
more of an adjustment to make to v10.4 because you haven't had the 
v10.3 experience yet but, again, you shouldn't have any complaints, 
just slight bewilderment as to why things happen the way that they do 
in the new version.

If you are able to do all the work that you want in v10.2, you might 
even consider waiting longer than a couple of months and see what other 
improvements come down the road. If the improvements of v10.4 aren't 
something you will definitely use or will vastly improve your 
productivity, it just might not be economically beneficial to you to do 
the upgrade yet.

Just because an upgrade comes down the road, it doesn't always mean 
that you should run down to the store and lay out all that money right 
away (Unless you are one of those people who HAVE TO HAVE the latest 
and newest of everything in their Mac). For those of us who spend hours 
and hours in front of Macs, the upgrades may have more meaning and 
benefits and may make our work easier. It all depends on what for and 
how you use your Mac.

I will be getting my copy as soon as I get my next check, so I have no 
excuse for spending except that I do work with Macs every day, putting 
them back in operating condition for the school district, and want to 
be able to keep up with the technical operating parameters.

If I was just a home-user or a student, I would wait until something 
came out that I really needed to keep my Mac working properly. If I 
were a SOHO user, I would consider the financial benefit to my SOHO 
versus the cost. If it makes me more money then it should be better for 
me, right?

Just my $.02 worth.
