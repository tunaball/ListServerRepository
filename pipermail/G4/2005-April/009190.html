<PRE>Well, I can answer some of this.

I bought  a computer from the Apple website, but I was purchasing from 
the refurb deal menu of the site.  They would not accept my CC, nor 
would they ship to my home address.  I am Canadian and we cannot get 
refurbished items from Apple Canada, even though Apple Canada is a 
shell company and your dealings are with Apple US.  Your bill is 
calculated in Canadian $ and they price is higher due to extra shipping 
and exchange ...

I had to send the US$ by mail and have it shipped to a US address to 
make my purchase.  As I am a past customer with Small Dog and they do 
deal with refurbs, I would not have to deal with these problems.

As for Mac WareHouse - well, in Canada they went bust and are owned by 
CDW and I they are a bit overpriced, in my opinion.

In short, all of these companies fill a niche in the market or they 
would not exist.  To each his own.
