<PRE>If the 500GB HD is attempted to be installed into a G4 without LDS is  
Large Drive Support (over 128GB) then the Drive could be a) not  
readable or mountable b) seen but only 128GB of it.

When I tried to put a 250GB HD into my old BWG3 no matter what I did,  
the OSX and OS9 would not see more than 128GB. I was lucky thought  
the HD had no data on it. BEcause... The Drive Utility Will want to  
Format that puppy.

My best idea for you with a 500GB HD that has Data on it now...

get an updated PCI ATA controller card and put it in your G4 machine.  
I've seen em for less than $50 in some spots. Is your DATA worth $50  
to you? I'd say it probably is.

 From my experience the Mac will not see the Data on the 500GB.

Where did the Drive come from? Another Mac that had OSX? some Windows  
OS box? Another Mac with OS9?

the 500GB HD will not be seen by a Machine with OS9 Unless the 500GB  
HD had been formatted with OS9 driver.

On My MDD Dual G4 I have the Option of formatting a HD with our  
without OS9 driver. If I choose not to do the OS9 driver then the HD  
can only be used and seen in an OSX Mac.

I cannot tell you the DEFINITIVE answer. I can only tell you based  
upon my experience and prior use.

I advise you to Seek more Info from other Mac Sages, Gurus, etc and  
ask them as well. I like to sometimes check out www.xlr8yourmac.com,  
the big kahuna who runs that sight has a plethora of info from old  
Macs to new and even has a few nice databases where you can check out  
other users posted test results of HD upgrades, DVD/CD, Processor, etc.

Peace,

Luke Rademacher

</I>&gt;<i> Without PCI cards or firmware modifications, etc. as have been

</I>&gt;<i> Does the Mac see some of the data but not all?

</I>&gt;<i> Would the data be erased if I tried to read data from it?

</I>&gt;<i> If I remove the drive and place it back into a system that can read

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I install OS9 and OSX on a smaller drive (128GB), and then
