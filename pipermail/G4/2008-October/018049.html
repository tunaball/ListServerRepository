<PRE>I once did something similar with an old AT power supply. It had the  
old clicking power button that actually stayed pressed in when it was  
on, meaning it was completing a circuit, I'd wager. Apple's and other  
ATX power supplies do use some external control, whether in the  
motherboard or in a separate little card like in the B&amp;W G3 and G4  
towers to control powering on and off.

So to put it shortly, I'd recommend finding an old power supply like  
that one. I think you're right in guessing that the new ones need a  
motherboard connection.

</I>&gt;<i> It's been a couple of weeks, but I need to ask you how you powered  
</I>&gt;<i> the drives that were sitting outside the chassis.  I have a  
</I>&gt;<i> CoolerMaster RS-450-ACLX power supply, which is normally used in a  
</I>&gt;<i> chassis to power all system components.  It, of course, has power  
</I>&gt;<i> connectors for hard drives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I set it up as a stand-alone power supply for two drives that are  
</I>&gt;<i> sitting outside the G4 chassis.  Meaning, it's connected only to a  
</I>&gt;<i> power outlet, and the two drives.  The two drives are connected to  
</I>&gt;<i> the Acard AEC-6280M card via some IDE ribbon cables.  What I don't  
</I>&gt;<i> understand is that when I switch the power supply on, it doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i> power on.  It doesn't make any noise, and the fan does not start  
</I>&gt;<i> up, and the drives certainly don't get any power.  It's as if it's  
</I>&gt;<i> not turned on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there another switch that I have to turn, or does it need to be  
</I>&gt;<i> connected to a motherboard, etc.?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any help you can provide.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not only is it possible to run 5 drives in the bottom of the case,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I did it for over a year in my DA.  My setup was exactly like  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yours, right down to the same ATA controller.  Here's how I did  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.  It's already been established that the middle position can  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only have one drive, so that is all I put there.  The rear most  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> position is the only one which can be used with Apple's 2 drive  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bracket so that is what I put there.  The last 2 drives had to be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mounted with some custom brackets that I made using strap metal,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is commonly available at a hardware store.  I had to offset  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the top drive so it would fit back away from the fan housing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The hardest part is running the cables.  It's a tight fit no  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> matter how you install the drives.  As I said, I ran mine for  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about a year this way and finally decided to go to SATA drives and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cables which fit a whole lot easier.  Since then I have moved the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4 data drives out of the DA case entirely and mounted them in a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separate large full-sized 5.25&quot; drive case which has it''s own  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PS.  Just made more sense from a heat and power stand point.  I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bought external pass thru SATA cables which go where the slot  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> covers normally fit and had to fabricate some for the drive case.   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Using 40 inch SATA cables allows some flexibility on where to put  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the drive case.  In any case it works well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
