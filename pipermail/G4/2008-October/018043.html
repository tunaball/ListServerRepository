</I>&gt;<i> only for the boot drive in the Zip bay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure there's an easier way-- I welcome any ideas anyone has for  
</I>&gt;<i> a better setup.  I need to keep the DVD burner in the machine, but  
</I>&gt;<i> I'd love to fit more drives!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will download the latest drivers on Harry's advice, and then see

Not only is it possible to run 5 drives in the bottom of the case,  
but I did it for over a year in my DA.  My setup was exactly like  
yours, right down to the same ATA controller.  Here's how I did it.   
It's already been established that the middle position can only have  
one drive, so that is all I put there.  The rear most position is the  
only one which can be used with Apple's 2 drive bracket so that is  
what I put there.  The last 2 drives had to be mounted with some  
custom brackets that I made using strap metal, which is commonly  
available at a hardware store.  I had to offset the top drive so it  
would fit back away from the fan housing.

The hardest part is running the cables.  It's a tight fit no matter  
how you install the drives.  As I said, I ran mine for about a year  
this way and finally decided to go to SATA drives and cables which  
fit a whole lot easier.  Since then I have moved the 4 data drives  
out of the DA case entirely and mounted them in a separate large full- 
sized 5.25&quot; drive case which has it''s own PS.  Just made more sense  
from a heat and power stand point.  I bought external pass thru SATA  
cables which go where the slot covers normally fit and had to  
fabricate some for the drive case.  Using 40 inch SATA cables allows  
some flexibility on where to put the drive case.  In any case it  
works well.
