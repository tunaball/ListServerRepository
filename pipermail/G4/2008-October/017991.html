<PRE>Thank you Eric and Bruce for responding. Since you both think the 
underlying problem might be the power supply, I will search for a 
reliable replacement.

Would it be smarter to move all those internal HDs to external, each 
with their own external power cord?

I did press the button on the motherboard the first time this happened, 
but it only worked if I had the original Seagate 80GB HD startup disk 
connected to the motherboard. When I reconnected the SATA Hitachi 80GB 
startup disk I got nothing, that is I heard the HDs spinning (since I 
have 4 internal) but the monitor was blank (black). Removing the SATA 
startup disk, reconnecting the original startup disk, and pressing the 
button seemed to solve the problem.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is kernal panics and freezes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some additional background:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> About a month ago I was downloading some Apple software updates when I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encountered some freezes that eventually turned to a kernal issue as I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did troubleshooting. I used the Disk Utility from the DVD install disk 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to check the startup disk, which at the time was a SATA connected to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the controller card mentioned above. All internal disks were verified. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At one point using the Disk Utility on the SATA startup disk, the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computer hung up. This continued to the point that I had to power 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down, power up, heard the drives spinning but blank on my monitor- 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just black.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I did some internal HD troubleshooting and finally determined that it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was the SATA startup disk that &quot;seemed&quot; to be the problem. I removed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it and swapped it with the original ATA HD directly connected to the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> motherboard, and voila, my G4 was back to &quot;normal&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now the perplexing problem:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was downloading the latest software updates from Apple, which 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> included the latest JavaScript,iTunes8, some remote security patch 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which I don't  use), and some other update that I cannot remember.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I started the update and walked away as I knew this would take some 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time. A half hour later I came back to a machine that had a kernal 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> panic and message that I needed to power down the machine. I did and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> powered up and resumed the update with only two items remaining of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> starting 4. I walked away again as it was iTunes 8 and JavaScript. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I returned I had another kernal issue but without the power down 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The first few lines of the kernal issue are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;System failure: cpu=1; code=00000001 (Corrupt Stack)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backtrace terminated- frame not mapped or invalid: 0x4AD8FF10
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unresolved kernal trap.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not computer savvy, just enough to sometimes help myself and of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> course sometimes to create problems. Any ideas, suggestions, notions, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preventive measures would help.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The machine is up and running. I decided not to continue with the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software download. Seems that that was one of the contributing factors.
