<PRE>Hey,

As a matter of fact this exact problem happened to me. Only a few of my 
applications would launch mostly incapacitating the machine. To fix 
this, run the upgrade to 10.2.5 if you don't have it just find it on 
Apple's website. I just ran it over my original 10.2.5 installation and 
the machine was none the wiser. I believe this is caused by a corrupt 
file deep in the system that is practically impossible to replace so 
doing this fixed my computer good as new. Don't forget your permissions 
fix at the end ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> Then I noticed that my old install of DAVE 3.x (to talk to windoze

</I>&gt;<i> still sometimes get &quot;DAVE sharing canceled quit&quot; on a shutdown attempt 
</I>&gt;<i> (no big, just shutdown again) but this is AFTER running its 
</I>&gt;<i> uninstaller.  I only mention this because it's an anomaly; and 
</I>&gt;<i> suggests I might be in DLL hell a la windoze.

</I>&gt;<i> I can run a few programs (Peak 3.21 and Netscape for example), but
