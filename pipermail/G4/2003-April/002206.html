<PRE>It definitely sounds like a flashed PC GF3 since it only has a VGA 
port. If the price is around same or better than a Radeon 8500 and the 
seller can give some sort of guarantee that it will work properly or 
allow you to return it, then it isn't such a bad deal. I actually sell 
GF3 cards on ebay under the name RedEclipseTurbo and have found first 
hand on how to flash these cards from the PC side. The hard part is 
finding ones that will fit inside a Cube and tolerate all the heat 
inside of them. Success rate is quite high for tower bound cards but 
the Cube has given me many challenges that I would never wish upon all 
but my worst enemies.

My latest project has been to successfully underclock the Cube bound 
cards to 175 core / 400 memory speed as well as the normal 200/460 
speed. For G4 towers I've tested them to work properly at 230/520 and 
if they pass that speed they get set to 225/500 for long term 
reliability and are ready to sell. This gives a nice 10% speed boost 
for anything that uses 3D acceleration and I have VGA only models as 
well as VGA + DVI. I do included the latest nVidia 3.0 drivers on CD 
for OS 9.2.2 and Apple's latest 10.2.5 fully supports the cards and 
also gives a nice 15% boost to Open GL and Quartz extreme with the 
latest driver update.

I'm also finishing up overclocked Apple GF4Ti cards (325/720) for those 
that want the fastest graphics possible and don' t want to wait for the 
Radeon 9700 or loose OS 9 acceleration in the process. I install a 
thermaltake G4 VGA cooler kit to keep the ram and core heat in check. 
Any questions can be emailed to me directly unless you feel it would 
benefit the rest of the list.
