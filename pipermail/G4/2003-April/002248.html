<PRE>I appreciate the pain you went through, but blanket generalizations just
don't work. I've run classic on several occasions since the 10.1.5
update, and see no problem with booting into OS 9.2.2

 &gt; Subject: Re: [G4] Jaguar - many apps fail to start - unexpected quit -
 &gt;  resolution?
 &gt;
 &gt; I finally got it back working.  And I've been to hell and back, too -
 &gt; flashing question mark, no drive, and I learned a lot about recovering
 &gt; from that situation, at least in my case.  Thanks Brian, and thanks, CJ,
 &gt; for your suggestions.  I hope I can save someone else this grief.
 &gt;
 &gt; This problem was originally an unexpected quit in almost every app I
 &gt; had, both Apple and 3rd-party, due to a protection fault in some
 &gt; subroutine in the X kernal that's used by all the affected apps.
 &gt;
 &gt; First of all, I tried starting OS9.2.2, just to see if it still worked.
 &gt;   I'm convinced now that this whole ordeal started when I started
 &gt; Classic for the first time after installing Jaguar.  And I sure hope
 &gt; it's over.
 &gt;
 &gt; When you start Classic in Jaguar for the first time, you get a box that
 &gt; says basically, &quot;I'm going to update some OS9 files for classic, neither
 &gt; classic nor OS9 booting will be affected.&quot;
 &gt;
 &gt; WRONG.  Reboot in OS 9.2.2, and this is what happens: the new Open
 &gt; Transport extension it installs doesn't work (actually Open Transport
 &gt; ASLM Modules), and a box appears that says there's an extension conflict
 &gt; and you need to restart with extensions off.  Only one extension has
 &gt; loaded, but there's a conflict.  Oh, yes, you're gonna lose QuickTime.
 &gt;
 &gt; Anyway, after fighting with Extensions Manager for about an hour, things
 &gt; were sometimes erratic, then the Microsoft Mouse driver crashed (what
 &gt; else?).
 &gt;
 &gt; Power off, power up, no happy mac.  No sad mac.  A blinking question
 &gt; mark in a folder.  That means there's no boot device found.  The OS9
 &gt; install CD offered to initialize the disk it couldn't read.  No thanks,
 &gt; I want my data.
 &gt;
 &gt; Panic first, then get out Disk Warrior after Disk First Aid fails to fix
 &gt; it.  Disk warrior found a bunch of garbage, but claimed it could fix it.
 &gt;   I saw my desktop when it was done, so now I knew I had a chance, but
 &gt; still no boot.
 &gt;
 &gt; But on the Disk Warrior CD, there's about one app that you can use:
 &gt; Startup Disk, just like the regular control panel.  I chose 10.1.5 and
 &gt; restarted, and it worked.  Apparently the data that specified the start
 &gt; disk had been lost, and this was the only way I could set it without an
 &gt; otherwise bootable system.  No, Startup Manager and
 &gt; hold-down-the-X-key-at-boot did NOT work.
 &gt;
 &gt; So I now have NO IDEA what happened to the original problem, except Disk
 &gt; Warrior may have fixed some file corruption created in the Classic
 &gt; extension snafu.  And now I have to reinstall OS9.
 &gt;
 &gt; But I found two VERY important things here, that are NOT in the Apple
 &gt; Knowledge Base:
 &gt;
 &gt; 1. Never run Classic from 10.1.5.  It'll hose OS9.  If you want OS9,
 &gt; boot that.
 &gt; 2. If you get the blinking ? folder at boot, try to set the startup
 &gt; system (using a CD or other drive since your HD doesn't work), it just
 &gt; may be confused, and it's a lot easier than initializing the disk and
 &gt; recovering from a backup, which is what I almost did (16 DVDs).
 &gt;
