<PRE>The one fact that gets my attention in this thread is that no one seems to 
want to understand that you cannot simply make a copy of any OS-X 
installation. There are invisible files that do not get dragged along with 
the system folder when you try to make a &quot;drag and drop&quot; copy like you could 
do with all the previous system versions.

You have the choice of trying to use the Carbon Copy Cloner software program 
or you have to dig out your original installation CDs and do a complete NEW 
installation on another hard drive and then drag and drop copy all your 
documents to it.

If you get yourself a bootable SCSI card, an external hard drive case, 
install an appropriate sized hard drive, plug the darned thing in and install 
the OS, you will have a solution to your problem. Since you had the CDs to do 
your original OS installation, you should still have them available for this 
job. If you didn't have the installation CDs in the first place and pirated 
the installation, then go out and buy them so you will have a set!

One acquaintance does an nightly back-up of his documents to CD-RW, but he 
keeps the program and OS install CDs handy in case of drive failure. As long 
as he has that CD-RW, he has all his documents saved and he can do a new 
program installation any time, for any reason, from the program and OS CDs. 
All he has to do is re-set his preferences and he's back on the job.

Personally, I use the external SCSI hard drive method. It was the easiest and 
cheapest way for me since I had the card and extra drives sitting around 
doing nothing anyway. BUT----I still keep the OS and program CDs handy.
