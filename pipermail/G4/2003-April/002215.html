<PRE>Steve,

First thing to try when things like this start happening is to create a new
user with administrative privileges (System Preferences &gt; Accounts), log out
of your original user, and log in as the new user.

See if that fixes things, then write back for more info. There may be more
than one problem involved.

Subject: [G4] Jaguar - many apps fail to start - unexpected quit


Help!  I sure hope someone has some idea where to turn next.

For a LOT of applications, when I try to start them, I get an unexpected
quit 
error before they even get started.  The most of any app I see is
Appleworks, 
which shows its menu and a hollow toolbar, then quits.  Other apps, like
iTunes, 
iCal (i.e., apple), Digital Performer 4, Microsoft mouse system preferences 
(third party), just quit before showing anything except maybe a splash
screen. 
The system profiler shows they always quit with a EXC_BAD_ACCESS, 
KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS, in a routine called __CFFromUTF8 which is called from 
__CFStringDecodeByteStream3.  At this point the stack traces differ.

This machine was shipped with OS9.2.2 and OSX 10.1.2; I just recently
upgraded 
to Jaguar 10.2.2, then 10.2.5.  It was beautiful!  Everything worked.

Then I noticed that my old install of DAVE 3.x (to talk to windoze machines)

wasn't removed by the installation (although it had appeared to be), so I
ran 
its uninstall.  I can't pin it down to this, but I still sometimes get &quot;DAVE

sharing canceled quit&quot; on a shutdown attempt (no big, just shutdown again)
but 
this is AFTER running its uninstaller.  I only mention this because it's an 
anomaly; and suggests I might be in DLL hell a la windoze.

I can run a few programs (Peak 3.21 and Netscape for example), but basically

this machine is dead in the water!

</PRE>
