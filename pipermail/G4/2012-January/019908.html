<PRE>I have an MDD PowerMac that was configured with a dual-drive SCSI Raid system driven by a PCI card; such systems were on Apples price list at the time, and this one was built to my order by the Apple reseller where I purchased it. It never would wake from sleep, and required rebooting every time I put it to sleep or it went to sleep by iteself. The reseller was unable to help be with the problem, so, I ultimately disabled sleep. I used it it for years, without ever letting it sleep, and it ran fine until an unknown fault caused me to retire it.

</I>&gt;<i> 	After a lot of frustration with my G4 locking up and failing to come out of sleep, I have finally found my trouble. I removed the new Sonnet Tempo SATA controller card and direct connected back to the original ATA drive. Everything is functioning so well I was able to install Leopard without a hitch and am running on it now. I'm not too pleased with the Sonnet folks over this one. While their claim that you can boot from their controller card does work, it comes with problems which are not addressed or mentioned. They are important ones!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	But using this old ATA-33 drive and interface has really slowed the machine down. Has anyone ever tried to use the default IDE interface to boot yet used a SATA interface for the root directories? It's my thought that I can use the IDE to boot and recover from sleep yet use the SATA drive for it's speed and space, and also to load programs or save data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Else I guess I would need to look at a new controller card and hope that I don't have a similar issue. The Acard brand has a controller which provides a single connection each for an IDE and SATA drive. But I don't know if I would have the same issues or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your thoughts or websites you know of which might help me out would be greatly appreciated!
