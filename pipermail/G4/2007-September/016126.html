You can upgrade the processor, but it might make more sense and be cheaper to just buy a different used Mac. You could get an 800 or higher for probably what an upgrade would cost -- and it will likely already have more RAM and a bigger HD, and it's much better (I think) to have an original processor machine than an upgraded one. I recently bought an 867mHz Quicksilver with 1Gig of RAM and a 120 HD for $300, including the OSX.4.x DVD. This was a real bargain, but you can find some good buys out there. Plus, you can sell the 400 for $50-$100 or so. That's what I'd do.

I doubt that a new OS will help the freeze. Maybe, you could try doing a clean install of the OSX.2.x, or find a good deal on OSX.3.x (Panther) which will let you use a newer browser and maybe other things. You don't mention what apps you are using on this Mac. The RAM could be a problem, and the HD which is tiny. You might add another 256M of RAM or more and say an 80-120 HD. I wouldn't add too much RAM to this old Mac unless I could transfer it to another Mac later. Again, look around and you'll find a newer, faster used Mac with more RAM and HD for probably less than upgrading this Mac would cost.

Or, you could just play with this Mac as-is for awhile, and when you discover how great Mac is buy a Mac Mini or some other newer/new Mac -- depending on how upgradable you like.
