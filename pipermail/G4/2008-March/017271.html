</I>Hello Kathy,

I tried wiping the drive clean on my MDD, but it still wouldn't see that 
a Mac OS X MDD CD was in the drive.  If I recall correctly when I put a 
non OS X CD in the drive, the CD image would mount on the desktop.  The 
same MDD did see my Mac OS X MDD DVD in the drive and that is how I 
loaded native OS 9 and X on my MDD.  What version of 9.2 did you find on 
Ebay?

Cordially,

Bruce Ryan Nakamura
