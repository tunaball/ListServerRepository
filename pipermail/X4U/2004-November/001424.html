He says he's tried cheap and expensive brands, and has had no success.

I'm not convinced this &quot;problem&quot; is related to format, so I'd guess CDs 
can have the same problem as you're experiencing.
I have had that problem with my CDs, and have had the same suggestion 
about &quot;maybe it's the brand of CD I'm using,&quot; or, &quot;perhaps it's the 
color of the plastic film over the recording media, vs. the color of my 
laser,&quot; or &quot;maybe you're trying to record data on a music CD.&quot;

That last one makes no sense to me, because data is data, isn't it? What 
you're trying to is take analog data in whatever form and translate it 
into digital pulses, and record it on a disc that is designed to record 
digital pulses. Not so?

Maybe there's some truth to all of those contentions, but the salient 
fact remains, where everything else should be right, some of us cannot 
do a proper burn, or cannot get the computer to read a disc ~ evn tho' 
the computer recognizes the drive just fine. Even tho' we've 
successfully done it before, and all we've changed is the recorder itself.

It could be that we're trying to lay blame on the most obvious of the 
components, either the disc or the player, &quot;things we can touch,&quot; while 
the problem could actually be any of a dozen other places. And probably 
is...

Frustrating, isn't it.
