</I>
I've seen a few similar comments reporting the sense key error message,
and some people get around it by using different media.  He mentioned
&quot;cheap and expensive&quot;, but never specified the speed rating or the type
of dye.

:<i> &gt;Try other brands and  see if the sense key errors stay consistent,

</I>
I dunno.  He only mentioned DVDs.  But it would be good to ask if the
same errors crop up when burning CD-Rs as well.

:<i> I have had that problem with my CDs, and have had the same suggestion 
</I>:<i> about &quot;maybe it's the brand of CD I'm using,&quot; or, &quot;perhaps it's the

</I>:<i> 
</I>:<i> That last one makes no sense to me, because data is data, isn't it? What 
</I>:<i> you're trying to is take analog data in whatever form and translate it

</I>:<i> digital pulses. Not so?
</I>
Yeah, that last suggestion sounds bogus.  All burnable CDs are, with
exception of the dye and the reflective layer, pretty much the same and
act pretty much the same.  There's no difference between CD-Rs in
general and CD-Rs that are advertised as &quot;rated for audio CD burning&quot;.
