What is it that does the &quot;shoving?&quot;
You put the DVD disc in a reader/writer, and the drive does what it 
needs to read or write. Self-contained unit, no?
How does any given CPU change any of that?
Does his CPU's bus (any of them) speed enter into any of this?
The Pioneer unit he's using accepts (?) data to support a sustained 
write speed of 11 MB/sec., which they says is &quot;8X&quot; for DVD.
Where's the potential bottle neck?
MUST it be presented at 11 MB/sec. in order to work? I thought that's 
the drive's business.

The instructions say that Pioneer drive will write to a DVD-R at 1X, 2X, 
4X, 6X or 8X. Seems there's no bottle-neck there.

Just trying to understand why the CPU you use matters. I mean, even the 
G3 uses one of the later processors and is a capable machine.

&gt;<i>...so you may be out of luck. Clearly if you got such 
</I>&gt;<i> poor results with the same drive in a newer machine which is actually 
</I>&gt;<i> supported by OS X, then you would have good grounds for returning it to 
</I>&gt;<i> the supplier.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Stroller.
</I>
I believe the G3 will work well with OSX.
I have a copy of Apple's OSX Panther just waiting to be installed over 
my Jaguar OS.
On the outside of the box it says it requires a G3, G4 or G5 processor 
with built-in USB and 128 MB RAM.
Now, that &quot;built-in&quot; USB requirement may be the kicker, as I don't think 
any of the G3s had it from the factory, but I can't see where lack of 
USB port is a stopping point, from the standpoint of using an operating 
system...

Just putting out what I think I know, to elicit what I don't know. 
Knowledge search!  &lt;g&gt;
