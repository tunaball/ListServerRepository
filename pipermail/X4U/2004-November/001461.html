<PRE>Well I have to comment on one thing
&quot;3. Games (never underestimate this reason).&quot;

Now don't get me wrong I am a huge Mac support, and slowly changing the
rest of my family and friends)

But when it comes to gaming the Mac does fall short.
What I mean by that is that is not performance its availability
IF a game is released for mac it is usually after PC.
Example I waited months for SimCity4 to be ported to Mac after the PC
release.
I have many friends that are really into this star wars RPG game, but I
can join because there is not a Mac version (no I am not using VPC too
slow)

Unless it is a mainstream game, we do get the short end of the stick
here.

And for this, I have had a challenge getting PC gamers to &quot;switch&quot;

&gt;<i> What I find strange is that if both Windoze boxes and Macs provide
</I>&gt;<i> roughly the same set of features to the end-user, why do people choose
</I>&gt;<i> the machine that is *harder* to use?  Do they honestly believe that
</I>&gt;<i> mastering a more difficult machine makes them a superior person?  Or
</I>&gt;<i> does it just make them a more difficult person?  :-)
</I>
People choose Windows for several reasons

1. The misperception that it is cheaper.
2. The misperception that other OS's won't have the tools that are
needed
   (though for some people this is true).
3. Games (never underestimate this reason).
4. It's what their buddy/relative recommended/provided.
5. They don't know anything else exists (people like this probably
shouldn't 
   even be allowed to have a computer).
6. It's what they use at school/work/whatever
7. Mac's are slow and cost to much (this is at least partially true).

Obviously there are many others as well.

Personally I don't believe that the Mac is the right choice for a lot of
people, but then I don't think that Windows is either.  For a lot of
people
a cheap x86 box running OpenBSD would be the best choice, with Linux a
good
second choice.  For the average person the Mac costs WAY to much.

BTW, the first choice for an OS for me is Mac OS X, my second choice is
OpenVMS.
