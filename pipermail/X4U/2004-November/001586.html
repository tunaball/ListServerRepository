<PRE>It' doesn't, that I know of.  But iChatAV does, of course.  And if the 
PC is running Windows XP and AIM 5.5, you can communicate between the 
two.

My brother-in-law in Rotterdam  has that setup...but of course has 
never gotten it to work.  He's too paranoid to change any of the 
built-in settings for the firewall on WinXP to open the right ports for 
video or audio.  In the past, he has literally spent DAYS wiping and 
re-installing, or virus checking, his hard drive to get rid of spyware 
or virii.

We certainly talk about it here, but I seriously think that this is the 
ONE HUGE advantage of OSX at this time (not that I believe that there 
CAN'T be similar threats, just less likely).

Off topic, but does anyone know of a program on Windows that would 
allow you to enter, say, a range of ports, and then have the program 
tell you (in a simple way) whether those ports are open for traffic?  
I'm surprised that AIM (or iChat AV, for that matter) doesn't simply 
put up a message like &quot;I see that you're trying to do 
videoconferencing; sorry, but you'll have to open ports 5000 to 5100 
for that to work&quot; or some other message.
