<PRE>I did the update, but when the screen came up with a redo of Airport 
set up assistant, I closed out of that as I am already set up!  Working 
fine.  Airport Base Station is screwy enough without confusing it 
anymore.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> station wasn't plugged into the router the laptop had a 10.0.x.x
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> address, and the tools found the base station at 10.0.1.1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Huh, yea I don't think I understand... but if it's finding it at 
</I>&gt;<i> 10.1.1.1 then the base station is doing NAT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Afterwards, when I put the Ethernet cable in the plug again and renew
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DHCP, the laptop got a 192.168.x.x that looks like an IP from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> router.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That IP is a self-assigned IP, meaning when the computer (or the 
</I>&gt;<i> airport) can't for some reason get an IP via DHCP, it just assigns 
</I>&gt;<i> itself that for lack of anything better to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the interface is different it may happen that the laptop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just didn't resolve 10.0.1.1 in the router's network. Does that make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sense? Why is not the base station managing its own network and doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NAT towards the router?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You you need to have &quot;share this network via NAT &amp; DHCP&quot; selected in 
</I>&gt;<i> the airport admin for the router, which tells it to do NAT, which I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> assuming you've done. There might be something funky going on between 
</I>&gt;<i> the base station and the router upstream... to where it doesn't think 
</I>&gt;<i> you're on the same network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There have been a ton of reports of this in the forums (apple has a 
</I>&gt;<i> habit of deleting them), and a lot of them orient around Comcast, etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple has never really offered a fix for the affected users, although 
</I>&gt;<i> they did say once that they thought it had something to do with the 
</I>&gt;<i> Airport base station getting the subnets confused: I.E., the base 
</I>&gt;<i> station somehow thinks it's on one, and thinks everyone trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> access the base station is on another. Things went really weird 
</I>&gt;<i> between 10.3 and one of the firmware updates, with most people I know 
</I>&gt;<i> who had the problem giving up and considering it a couple of hundred 
</I>&gt;<i> dollars down the drain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It generally only affects Airport's: plug in any other model from 
</I>&gt;<i> another company, and it works great.
