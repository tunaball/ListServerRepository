What I find strange is that if both Windoze boxes and Macs provide
roughly the same set of features to the end-user, why do people choose
the machine that is *harder* to use?  Do they honestly believe that
mastering a more difficult machine makes them a superior person?  Or
does it just make them a more difficult person?  :-)

Most people don't think about Macs because they *incorrectly* believe
that it doesn't running M$ Office.  When I inform them that M$ Word was
a Mac-first product, has been around for almost 20 years since the birth
of the Mac, and has always been available for the Mac, many people are
open-minded enough to be considerate of Macs.  Some people still moan
and groan, even though I've taken away their #1 complaint.  So at this
point, they are no longer interested in having a open dicussion.  I stop
talking to them because it because I'm not getting paid to destroy them.
