</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;The frightening thing is, last I heard certain types of businesses require
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;WordPerfect.  I was a big WP fan back in the dark ages of MS DOS, and I even
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;liked the first version of WP for the Mac.  WP V3 for the Mac was HORRIBLE!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm curious, Zane, why do you feel that WP/Mac (at least the last version
</I>&gt;<i>of it) was horrible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Randy B. Singer

I wish I could give a better answer on that, but I honestly don't 
remember, I used it briefly back in '95.  Like I said, I really liked 
V1/Mac and I used V4.2/DOS and V5.1/DOS for years.  But with V3/Mac, 
I really disliked the whole interface (I also dislike V5.2/Win).

For me 1995 was a weird and transitional year for computers.  I'd 
been running DOS since '87, OS/2 since '91, and Linux since January 
of '92.  In January of '95 I spent $4500 on a Pentium 90 laptop with 
16MB RAM, an 800MB HD, and a 640x480 256 colour Active Matrix display 
(my Mom actually still uses this laptop).  I loaded it up with DOS, 
Win3.1, OS/2 3.0, and Linux.  I then bought Lotus Smartsuite for 
OS/2, it sucked so bad (totally unstable) that with MS releasing 
Win95 I gave up on OS/2 and in July went out and bought what has 
proven to be one of my favorite computers of all time a PowerBook 
520c.  I bought WP V3/Mac for it, as well as ClarisWorks, both were 
OK for word processing but I didn't like the way they worked.  Then I 
got a chance to try MS Word 6.0, I went out and bought a copy of MS 
Office 6, ASAP.

I've since upgraded MS Office 3 times (didn't get the last Classic 
release), and am running the most current release now.  All in all, 
I'd just as soon be running Word 6, it did everything I want, and 
didn't frustrate me (Randy, you've helped me with a couple of my Word 
rants in the past year or two).  I've got to be honest, I'm not sure 
I should have upgraded to the latest version of MS Office, but at the 
same time I've not used MS Word hardly since getting it (that's 
hopefully going to change soon if I can find the time for more 
writing).  In the long run I really think I'll be dumping MS Word in 
favor of something else.
