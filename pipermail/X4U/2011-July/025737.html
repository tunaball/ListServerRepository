<PRE>Thanks to Chris Long and Neil Laubenthal for helping me. I thought I 
would mention what I have done so far.

1. Haven't figured out how to do this but was told by Fairpoint Fios 
that I would have to purcahse a static ip number from them first. I was 
also told I have to contact HP to find out if my 2100 tn printer is 
capable  of having a static ip.

2. I tried going to 192.168.1.10 (what the printer is now) on my browser 
but got a message &quot;Macintosh OS is not supported to run this application.&quot;

3. My printer is too old for Bonjour.

If I need help from Fairpoint there is a one time fee of $75. That got 
me thinking it might be easier to buy a new printer that users Bonjour. 
That leads to two questions
1. Since I have never used Bonjour is it easy to set up - and will it be 
around for several more years?
2. When I bought this printer there were b/w inkjets worth getting. 
Would I be better with an inkjet or laser if I print about 50 pages a month?

 From Neil
&gt;<i> 1. In your Actiontec you can reserve a particular IP for your printer based on it's MAC address so it will always get the same IP.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. You can assign a static IP to the printer . . . usually this is by letting it get one from the Actiontec then browsing to that IP in Safari. From there you can change the printer from DHCP to static IP and give it a fixed IP, subnet mask, and gateway (use the same gateway and mask that the DHCP provided).
</I>&gt;<i> 3. You can connect to the printer via Bonjour networking instead.
</I>
my original post
&gt;<i> The problem I have involves my HP 2100 tn printer on my home network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The router/provider assigned dynamic ip numbers. That is no problem 
</I>&gt;<i> with my devices, whether a Slingbox, computer, laptop, direct tv 
</I>&gt;<i> receiver. They adjust, though I do not know how.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With this printer, however, when I turn it on it gets a different ip 
</I>&gt;<i> number - 192.168.1.x - the x can be, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, whatever. 
</I>&gt;<i> Presently it is 15.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I print a configuration page it tells the correct ip number, but 
</I>&gt;<i> when I go to print on my Mac, there is a problem. I have to add the 
</I>&gt;<i> printer - in this case, 192.168.1.15. But next time I turn it on the 
</I>&gt;<i> printer might be 192.168.1.7. So I have to add that as if it were a 
</I>&gt;<i> new printer. Right now I have printers with 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 14, and 15 
</I>&gt;<i> as the last digit. All the same printer with latest drivers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I go to print it is trial and error to pick the correct one. And, 
</I>&gt;<i> the next time I go to print, the ip might be a new number, say 
</I>&gt;<i> 192.168.1.17. That would mean none of my other 7 will work and I have 
</I>&gt;<i> to add another number.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there another way to use this printer with my 2 Mac network? 
</I>
</PRE>
