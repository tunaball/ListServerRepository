The only advantage I see to Lion is that it includes the server 
version. Anyone know if this means that it will be legal to run it 
under emulation? Running under VMWare could be a solution.

iCloud gives me nothing as far as I can tell. The end of the MobileMe 
Gallery will be a loss. The convenience of sharing direct from iPhoto 
is handy. There are other photo share solutions, but I don't suppose 
they will ever work direct from iPhoto. MobileMe sync will also be a 
loss, but iCal sync has already become very hit and miss with a PPC 
iBook in the loop. Keychain sync has produced oddities for some time.

I have an @mac.com address which I imagined I would keep going after 
I finally retire and I no-longer need my own domains, but now I don't 
trust Apple to keep that going 'for ever', so my plans have switched.

I run an Intel mini from a past project as a Safari browser for 
online manuals for my main work on my iMac, for iCal, iTunes and the 
like. I have recently been given a PPC mini which i can run headless 
and access it over Finder Screen Sharing from the iMac or Intel mini. 
I'm considering swapping the minis around and testing Lion on the 
Intel mini and put the screen on the PPC mini. That would let me 
investigate Lion's server capabilities without losing a screen that 
can do everything.

I don't see Lion becoming my general OS for some time.

The whole iCloud / MobileMe iCal with Leopard / Rosetta / iOS5 thing 
looks to me like Apple trying to force everyone to move to the latest 
kit. The second major thing Apple has always had over the Wintel 
world is that their kit may be more expensive but it just runs for 
more years. (The first, of course, being no Windows).
