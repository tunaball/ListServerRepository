There aren't enough apps on the tablet side but there are many apps for the phones. Neither the iPhone nor Android phones should be trashed.

Can I second this statement. Both phones are very good and I'm confident that the original poster would be happy with either.

&gt;<i> I should have stated my primary reason of asking a smartphone question on a MacOS X forum is how well does Android sync data with Macs. Allan, since you use a Mac and an Android phone, do you exchange data with your phone - iCal, Address Book, etc, and how well does that work for you? Do you use an intermediary, like a Google account to do so?
</I>
Bizarrely, my wife's iPad struggled synching via Mobile Me (or whatever it's called now) so I switched her to using Google for Calendar and Address book synching. Now she can add appointments in iCal on the Mac, iCal on the iPad or the Calendar app on her Android phone and it all syncs sweet as can be. Same for contacts.

Me, I don't have an iPad but my Android phone works fine using my Mac and Google.

Added bonus #1: I'm subscribed to my wife's &quot;Home&quot; calendar so I get to see all that stuff on my phone too. She doesn't even need to tell me where I've got to be anymore. (This is also a drawback as a plausible excuse for missing things has been removed).

Added bonus #2: I can use tethering on my Android phone without having to pay my provider an extra GBP 10.00 per month to enable this feature (which is what it was going to cost me on an iPhone. A complete rip off as I pay for &quot;unlimited&quot; data on my contract. To be clear, tethering is a rarely used feature but tends to be crucial when needed).

For info, we both use IMAP for mail so everything stays in synch on that side too.
