<PRE>We have 8GB of RAM on test with a current Mac Mini Server. It booted fine, which was a relief. And we have been testing it the past few days to see if there are any problems we can spot.

We will be using 2 Mac Minis Servers, both with 8GB RAM, hooked via iSCSI to a Drobo Elite. The operating systems will be Snow Leopard Client running Parallels 5 and a bunch of virtual machines (stored on the Drobo) split between the 2 MMS boxes. The ideas is that the load is divided, but if 1 MMS fails, it's easy to restart the remaining VMs on the other MMS.

My searching intimated that any MMS will run 8GB of RAM. Along with the current batch of nVidia 9400 Mac Mini Clients. With the earlier machines, it seems that as long as your 9400 nVidia Mac Mini has the 1.2 firmware update, it should be fine.

As always, don't buy cheap RAM. It never works well in Apple boxes. We are using Team Elite for our testing and it seems to work great. I would expect that any Brand Name RAM should be OK but YMMV!

Regards,

cjc

&gt;<i> Anyone on this list running 8GB of Ram in a Mac mini? OWC and Ramjet both claim to have 8GB kits for the Mac mini. Some articles I came across on Google seem to say that the current generation of mini works well with 8GB and Snow Leopard. Crucial's website goes with the official Apple supported maximum 4GB of RAM. I realize that for our publishing company, Apple considers the iMac the ideal solution for us. However, I do like being able to use my own screens instead of the all-in-one design of the iMac, as I like to be able to move screens around as we need to change workstations occasionally. I don't care for all-in-one desktops, if I want an all-in-one I'll get a notebook. I'm using a 13&quot; MacBook Pro, and this is my favorite Apple notebook I've ever used. However, I'm finding that with Snow Leopard, 4GB of RAM just doesn't cut it. I'm planning on upgrading my Book to 8GB from the current 4GB, and I've got a few Mac minis in the office that I'd love to upgrade to 8GB and Sno
