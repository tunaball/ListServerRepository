<PRE>People still surprise me.  I started in 1985 when I bought my first  
Mac Plus.  That's now 25 years.  I know some things, but not all.
Last week I convinced a lady to upgrade from a first iMac to a Mac  
Mini.  Then she could run all the songs and video she got from PC  
people.  She still has 10.2.8.
She told me she had all the cables needed to connect 2 Macs to move  
the soft from the first to the second.  She had no FW cable.  She  
bought the new mac on an impulse while I was there.
I left it then for it and told her if she needed to mail again, she  
could go to the iMac and do what she needed to do.  She used her old  
keyboard and mouse on the new Mac.
Today she called me that she moved the ethernet cable back again to do  
some mailing but that the cursor didn't move.  I asked her if she had  
moved the keyboard back also.
She didn't.  Probably she assumed that moving the ethernet cable was  
enough.  She writes down what I tell her in case something happens  
what to do, but then she forget where she placed it.

Someone else refuse to read books or see video lessons about  
something.  He asks me to explain it 10 (yes 10) times and then he  
will understand.  I don't do that.  Even after he offered me money.
