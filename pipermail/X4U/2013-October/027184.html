It's always happened for technology reasons, but Apple are creating 
situations that are much worse than normal purely by policy decisions.

I can't upgrade the TomTom s/w on my Palm because only the newer 
Palms have the power to run the later versions. Unfortunate, but 
realistic.

I can't run most apps on my iPhone because it won't run the latest 
iOS. Fair enough when there never was a version that would run on my 
iOS version - but Apple only allow the latest version of the app on 
the store, and you can't get them from anywhere else. If the apps I 
want were loaded back when my wife used it as her phone then I'd have 
the apps now. That's an Apple Policy decision that that means I need 
to buy hardware. That's wrong, and the only case I've come across.

</I>&gt;<i>Buying &quot;second best&quot; because you're pissed at a dead guy is idiotic.
</I>
That would be, but buying second best because a company policy 
severely limits the fully effective working life of the best is not.
