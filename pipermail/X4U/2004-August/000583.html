<PRE>Last year was my 2nd year of high school yearbook production.  Because 
of a grant, we switched all our eMacs to OSX Jaguar and InDesign.  We 
basically did production on 8 machines, and the difference was night 
and day.  We had almost no shutdowns the entire year, reserving most of 
our problems for digital photo processing which was a high learning 
curve for all of us.  But, I must say...25 kids put computers and OSX 
through their paces.  End result was quite beautiful.  I learned a lot 
about InDesign and building on PageMaker experience ... met my 
deadlines (with the help of Visual QuickStart Guide).  IMHO there is no 
comparison between production on 9 versus 10.  I kissed the computers 
every Friday on my way out the door.
