<PRE>Yes, I think Rober twas missing my point. He was still trying to log into 
root without enabling it first. I just composed an email response to him 
and sent it to the list but forgot to send it plain text and it got 
rejected, d'oh!

Anyway Paul, you have now confirmed that you can indeed &quot;enable' root via 
the CD - thanks!

Cheers,

Cojcolds

ps. anyone else noticed the list sig is about a third its usual size.... 
or am I slow to notice things???  I like the new size better!

Couple of thoughts. I was under the impression that resetting the 
password using the CD did enable the root account. In fact I've just 
verified that by doing a CD/reset password on a Panther Mac that (I 
checked) had a disabled root account beforehand. After that I was able 
to log in fine using the root account. May I ask what gives you the 
impression that root isn't being enabled in your case?

Root (or System Administrator, to use Apple's long name) will not show 
up when the login panel shows a list of users, that's one main reason 
the Other button also shows in the login screen. Click that and you get 
the user &amp; password login pane where you can specify a non-listed 
account name.

Additionally, if auto login is set and you're dropped straight into 
Finder without needing a password, doing a logout will still get you 
back to the login screen.

cheers,

Paul.
