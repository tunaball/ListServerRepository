</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hence what you see as no action is just the finder taking a long  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> time to do this compare. If you to wait I believe eventually the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unsuccessful ones would not. In my case none of them moved. I am  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at a lost to explain why one was successful but when all were  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tried nothing got moved. I do not pretend to understand the finder  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but it did seem inconsistent (I hate inconsistency). What I ended  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up doing was copying the contents of the folder to a new folder  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and did a drag and dropped and of course everything copied. I was

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then I guess it makes sense. I wanted to keep the date of the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> folder to be in sync with the other folders but I was not able to.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SO I cannot sort by date anymore (and get correct view) :(

Jens:

I just got your email on 6/12/2009 at 11:45 it looks like 1.5 months  
or so. I am really puzzled by this delay. I have sent the owner an  
email asking if I am being moderated and the person has not responded  
but I guess the delay is somewhere along the way. Its been  
frustrating trying to deal with the issues as the delay is  
intolerable (to say the least).
The problem sort of got resolved and to be honest I forgot how it  
was. I am sorry two months ago is stretching my limited memory. Maybe  
the email explaining how it got resolved will show up.
I have to believe that the issue(delay) is with a server someplace.

Ed
