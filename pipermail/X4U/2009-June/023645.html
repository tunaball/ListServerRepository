Mark,
By the time you see this reply, you'll have hopefully figured this out.  My
guess is that the games have a lot to do with it.  My wife has the iPod
touch, and has found that the WiFi drains the battery insanely fast, games
drain it fast, but just listening to audio results in a fairly good battery
life.

Sent on June 24th.  Yes, I'm looking to see how long it takes for this to
show up.
