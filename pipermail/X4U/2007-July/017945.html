<PRE>The short version:
Has anyone else had problems running the Harry Potter Games in Win-XP  
on Boot camp?

Thanks,
John

The longer version:

For my grandkids I recently bought on eBay a new-in-box set of 4
Harry Potter games intending to run them in Win-XP on the Boot camp
side. I've a few other PC games that I use there with no problems at
all.

So I'm running a recent model 24&quot; Intel iMac with 1 gig memory and
lots of speed. The OS in Boot Camp is a registered version of Windows
XP SP2 with MS updates thru about the end of May 07.

The games are:
	 1) Sorcerer's Stone
	2 )Chamber of Secrets
	3) Prisoner of Azkaban

For some reason none of the games operate correctly. The problems
seem to be related....
        In game #1: It loads, the display works but the
synchronization with voice is way off. The voice reading text at the
bottom of the screen only gets about halfway thru before the scene
changes.  Time allowed for complex tasks counts down very fast. About
three seconds is allowed for a task I estimate ought to allow about
20 seconds for an 8 yr old. Can't get past the first magic lesson.
Loaded on my wife's Compac laptop, it doesn't work there either.
Timing error is much worse! Less than 1 sec for that same magic task.

	In game #2. It loads, video is a bit choppy and the controls
sluggish. But so far we've been able to live with it. Some of the
wand feats are very hard to do because timing is off a bit as in game
#1.

	In Game #3. When I try to start it up, it aborts and goes to the
WinXP desktop. I get a Critical Error window that tells me I've got a
Pentium processor and that I have a problem with negative delta time.
No error number tho. Loading it on my wife 's Compac laptop with Win-
XP older than mine it works beautifully.

So far EA (Electronic Arts) has not been any help. Their knowledge
base has no similar problems discussed. The only suggestion is to
make sure my video drivers are up to date. Seems like my speedy  
NVIDIA video system
should be able to handle 3 year old software.  Running dxdiag suggests
that nothing is wrong with my system. But something obviously is
incompatible with the EA Harry Potter games

Any suggestions for where or what to try next?

Thanks,
John
