<PRE>Hello Stroller,

First, let me thank you for all this precious information that I have, of course, printed for future reference. So if 
I understand well what you say, iPhoto imports in the original folder RAW files with no problem but cannot 
display these files. In order to display them so I can see them on the monitor, iPhoto immediately converts 
these RAW files into JPEG files and place them in the Modified folder. Doing so, I can see them and edit 
them. If iPhoto works like this, that's fine with me. I see no problems here. iPhoto's native format is JPEG. 
OK again.

Then there's Aperture (which I have 1.5). RAW is it native format. OK again. In understand the magic behind 
&quot;losless&quot;. I already work on my RAW files in Aperture.

But I do love iPhoto's managing system. I use it to manage all of my digital photos. So what should I do? 
Manage the RAW files in Aperture and manage the JPEG in iPhoto? I still prefer to use only one program to 
manage all of my photos and I'm very familiar and have developped some experience with iPhoto. What I 
don't want is to have duplicates of files, RAW or JPEG on the HD. As you can see, I shoot in both RAW and 
JPEG. There are times when I don't need the all goodness of RAW.

Some say I should do all my managing and editing in Aperture since I don't edit at all in iPhoto (did it 
ocasionnaly and features are quite good actually). Oh la la, what's a man with two superb programs to do?


Thanks again

Yesterday, I added 28 RAW photos to iPhoto 6. Happy me, I like th app very much. A minute later, the 
program added 28 JPEGs without my consentment in the &quot;Modified&quot; folders. I didn't do anything to the 28 
photos but look at them in full view mode. Oh yes I did work one one single file. Still I find that iPhoto adds 
copies to the &quot;Modified&quot; folders like whenever it feels to do so. Do someone knows what's happening here?

(continued)

I think in your case the reason for these copies being made is that you imported the files in RAW format. You 
stated that iPhoto created the &quot;modified&quot; files as jpegs, which are a format iPhoto can view and modify. You 
can't crop a RAW photo as such - only create a bitmap copy of a RAW file and then crop that - so I think 
iPhoto is importing the images into its &quot;native&quot; format of jpegs so that you can view them within iPhoto and (in 
the future) edit them (if you wish).

Aperture may be better for managing RAW files, I think, as Aperture considers RAW files to be its native 
format. Aperture also stores jpeg copies of the RAW files it has imported, however, it consider these 
&quot;previews&quot; rather than its modified copies. When you crop in Aperture - or change the colour tone - you don't 
actually modify the image you just store a set of crop dimensions or colour corrections _to be applied to_ that 
image. Changes are applied to the jpeg preview that you're viewing in the editing window but it's only when 
you go to print or export the picture that they're applied to a fresh copy of the RAW file (the RAW file itself 
being retained unchanged) at full-pixel resultion. In this way Aperture is considered &quot;lossless&quot; photo editing for 
the sorts of photographic enthusiasts who are keen on using RAW files.

Stroller.
