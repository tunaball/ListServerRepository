Sorry - I meant to say.

Just the 512meg it was shipped with.

When I ordered the lappy a year ago Apple's price for extra RAM was  
(of course) just silly, and as I recall even 3rd-party RAM was  
prohibitive. At &#163;55 for 2gig now it's not worth buying half as much,  
IMO - I think a year ago RAM was more like twice the price and at the  
time (having just lunched out &#163;950 for the laptop and Applecare) &#163;120  
for 2gig was a bit more than I was prepared to spend.

With 512meg already fitted &quot;free&quot; the cost-benefit was loaded against  
the expense (of &#163;60, I think) just to double the RAM to 1gig. I  
figured that since 512meg definitely and very clearly makes a big  
difference for Windows XP I;d be happy with that - when the MacBook  
arrived I was quickly surprised how sluggish it was.

I have always intended to stick with dual-channel - probably the  
difference would be unnoticeable, but dual-channel is &quot;the best&quot; - in  
this laptop and to max out the RAM to 2gig as soon as I could afford it.

I can't help wondering now that I've seen the results of Activity  
Monitor whether 1gig of RAM would've been just as good. Activity  
Monitor seems to indicate that 1gig is the sweet-spot, but I can't be  
bothered now to pull one of the sticks I fitted and besides it would  
be impossible to get an objective judgement when my important  
consideration is &quot;snappiness&quot;.

Stroller.
