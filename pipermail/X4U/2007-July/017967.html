<PRE>Not exactly no listmom.... More of a dysfunctional emotionally  
detached listmom.

Back in the late 90s when I created lists I had time to dig into them  
and be an attentive listmom. The lists and my website were great and  
they really helped feed my fledgling Mac consulting business.

Then came the big decision, do I feed my family by doing consulting  
and the web site, or do I move to buying and selling stuff. I made  
the decision to move to the buying and selling side of things and  
opened Dr. Bott LLC. Turns out, it was a wise decision because the  
combination of the dotcom crash and Steve Jobs coming back to Apple  
eliminated much of my income from the web site and from consulting (a  
huge portion of my business was helping people figure out what to  
buy. Steve made it deal simple and people didn't need my help like  
they did when Apple had dozens of models not to mention the clones.)

So today I spend my days running Dr. Bott LLC and that leaves little  
room for the lists. I've chosen to let them manage themselves and  
only jump in if things get real ugly. I think it is really great that  
most of them continue to thrive after years of &quot;self management&quot;.

So yes, I exist but not in the classic uber controlling way that many  
would appreciate.

Just this week I got back in to the email accounts. (Anyone have the  
issue we do where X Server will occasionally munge user passwords in  
the opendirectory server?)

I have dreams and ideas for the lists, but for now we'll let them  
continue as is. I did manage to remove the ebay stuff sig! ;-)
