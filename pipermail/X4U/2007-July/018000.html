I remember this discussion quite clearly, too. IIRC it was started by  
a guy who was blogging, &quot;why isn't my software in this bundle? Well,  
let me tell you...&quot; I have no beef with him at all - he was clearly  
just explaining why MacHeist wasn't worth it to him, but I'm sure I  
afterwards read of other developers who were quite happy with the  
deal. I'll bet if you were to google &quot;MacHeist&quot; you'll find all these  
discussions, so the authors whose software is being sold this time  
around are hardly going in blind.

I'll bet that many of the buyers of this bundle will use 3 or 4 of  
these apps and barely ever touch the other half-dozen or more - so in  
this case the 5 bucks net being received is money for nothing. There  
will be no support costs for those purchasers and they are sales that  
wouldn't otherwise have been made.

I feel you may underestimate the cost of advertising and marketing in  
your analysis above, but whatever - it's the nature of business that  
profit makes ventures worthwhile. Clearly all the authors were  
willing participants and don't need defending (although, fair enough,  
buy directly from the authors if you prefer to support them that way).

Personally I have a very strong bias against shareware - perhaps a  
somewhat unreasonable bias - and have only ever once paid money for a  
downloaded app. With their fully-functional non-commercial-use  
license Grisoft have made far more money through me &amp; my business  
customers.

Stroller.
