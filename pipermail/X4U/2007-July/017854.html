<PRE>Unfortunately, nothing but trouble on my end.  Just walked into the  
Oklahoma City, OK Apple Store and purchased an 8GB.  Took it home.   
Tried to activate it, when the trouble started :-)

My suburb of Oklahoma City has been issued a new Zip code by the USPS  
effective July 1.  When I tried to activate, I tried to enter my  
regular, &quot;old&quot; zip.  The activation then said that that wasn't  
recognized...would I like to select the address with the NEW zip?  
(There was no choice here...select the New zip or give up).  So I  
did.  Then I get the message that &quot;AT&amp;T does not offer wireless  
service in your area.&quot;  Of course, I've had Cingular here for 6 years.

Call ATT customer support. They basically explain that their credit  
process can only pull up my NEW zip, but that their &quot;coverage map&quot; is  
based on zip code...and does not recognize the NEW code, only the old  
one.

This wasn't the Infinite Loop I was hoping to see :-)

Supposedly someone will be able to override this tomorrow during  
&quot;credit&quot;s office hours (which don't follow the Support hours...grrr).

Why, oh why, Apple, did you see fit to lock out the other features of  
the darn iPhone until the &quot;phone&quot; part was activated?
