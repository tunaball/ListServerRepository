<PRE>thanks to all for the feedback&#8230;

what i ended up doing was synching my wife's iphone with my account. iTunes then asked if i really wanted to sync the phone with another account and replace my apps, i said yes, and synced. what was really nice (thanks Apple!) is that all iTunes did was re-link the installed apps, therefore keeping all app preferences and log-in info (mail, Facebook, etc).

regards, alexandre

</I>&gt;<i> This is exactly how my wife and I sync our iPads. It works fine, as we use my iTunes/App Store account  to make purchases and sync them between iPads. We also do the same thing with books purchased via my Amazon Kindle account. We sync our address book, calendar and e-mail accounts as well as bookmarks separately -- me on my iMac and her on her MacBook.

</I>&gt;<i> If you only want to have one iTunes account or Amazon Kindle account, and can agree on the shared/purchased books, apps, music, etc., then it's certainly a lot less complicated than having two separate accounts, and it also prevents duplicate purchases. The only problem is remembering to manually select which items to sync with iTunes when it's time to update or backup. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> furthermore, with iOS 5 around the corner and OTA syncing, is this set-up still going to work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Who knows? The only people who know are developers and Apple employees, and they are sworn to secrecy by non-disclosure agreements or threat of being fired. When IOS 5 and the &quot;cloud&quot; are released to mere mortal users like you and me in the near future we'll all find out. But logic suggests that there will be a method for multiple users of one Apple &quot;cloud&quot; account to manually select what gets synched with each device and each user account in a multiple-user household. And I suspect that it still will be possible to sync certain features manually through iTunes. There are far too many Mac users without &quot;cloud&quot; access for Apple to totally shut off the ability to sync mobile devices with Apple, as well as Windows, computers.
