<PRE>Eddie, I agree with you. 

Pretty impressive list you provide. And it's not even complete as there are
so many issues around Spotlight and the UI. What annoys me just as much is
how many of the small issues that have long been around are still not
polished. (Yes, I have filed them all on the Apple bug site.)

At least I believe I can provide reasons for three of the changes that you
list:

- .plist files cannot be edited via TextEdit
==&gt; performance. .plist files can now be plain XML or binary. They can be
converted into each other and both should work with the application. XML
obviously is human readable (well, depends on the human). Binary format is
faster. Under Tiger binary format is now the standard.

- Status messages removed from Startup progress window
- Can no longer rearrange Login Items
==&gt; Both are results of the new startup mechanism in Tiger which tries to
launch processes in parallel and deferred when possible. So ordering does
not make much sense nor can you provide a sequence of process launches in
the startup progress window.

- Can no longer use Control-Tab/Shift-Control-Tab to cycle the sorting
column in the List view of Finder windows.
- Resize cursor no longer appears when you mouse over List view columns
- Can no longer put often-used panes in the toolbar of System Preferences
- Can no longer quickly select panes in System Preferences by typing their
name
- Can no longer choose default browser or e-mail client without launching
Safari or Mail
- Removed Fax button in Print dialog box
- .plist files cannot be edited via TextEdit
- No AFP connections over AppleTalk
- Disable Journaling button removed from Disk Utility
- Rotating Cube effect removed from Image Capture
- .Mac avatars removed from Mail
- Save All command removed from Stickies
- Status messages removed from Startup progress window
- Deleting open folders no longer closes them
- Can no longer drag items to window titlebars
- Removed the DVD Playback &amp; Presentation options in Energy Saver
- Can no longer rearrange Login Items
- System Preferences slow-motion effect (when using shift key) removed
- Automatically connect to strongest AirPort network setting gone
- Removed option-click from Safari's Downloads window (would toggle info)
- Embedded .mov files are no longer listed in Safari's Activity window
- Removed 'Play' button from Preview for animated gifs
- Reduced QuickTime Player's levels of volume from 7 to 4

&gt;<i> But probably because they confused a lot of novice (stupid) users. I

</I>&gt;<i> give too many options to people they will click and click and click

</I>
I don't think novice users knew about these features. Most of these items
would not cause a problem even if tech-illiterate people clicked and clicked
on them mindlessly.
