<PRE>I am hoping somebody will be able to help me with this problem. I  
have called MLB three times and been kept on hold for an hour each  
time; two of those times I was told a Mac tech would call me back but  
it didn't happen. Have also emailed several times and was finally  
sent an email telling me I had to call the support number.

I am using a g4 mac mini with macos 10.4.6 and am now using flip4mac.  
Used MLB gameday audio successfully all last season and for world  
Baseball classic. I am blind, so I am using the built-in voiceover  
system for blind which is accessed by pressing command-f5. My problem  
is that while I can listen to gameday audio live games and can access  
the 2005 archives, I cannot find a way to access the 2006 archives.  
The exception to this is that if an audio link is still up from  
earlier thad day, I can access that archived game. I don't know if  
this is a Mac problem or a problem with what I'm able to find with  
voiceover: i.e.: perhaps something graphical is not showing up. Here  
are the steps I've followed to try to access the 2006 archives:

1. I go to the mlb website (I've started using the narrow bandwidth  
site because while the audio that plays when the site is loaded used  
to play now it just makes my mac mini's fan rev up.

2. I go to the &quot;gameday audio&quot; link.
3. I go to the &quot;on demand&quot; link.
4. I go to the &quot;html version&quot; link.
5. After clicking on the &quot;html version&quot; link (actually it's a key  
combination I use as a blind voiceover user rather than an actual  
mouse) I get to an url that ends in grid.jsp. It does indeed show  
links o archived games in mlbtv and gameday audio but the links on  
the page are still for the World Series for 2005. There is a set of  
popups for selecting a different date; I can change the month and day  
popups, but 2005 appears to be the only year in the year popup menu.

I did post this on a list specifically for blind users but got no  
responses. I'm hoping somebody may be able to give me a link I should  
look for or something I need to do to access the 2006 archives. I do  
know this might be difficult if mlb has somehow implemented some kind  
of graphical setup I either can't find or can't click.

tia for any help.
