This is just my personal observation and not intended to offend anybody:
You know how we Mac users have always been different and we often  
used to refer to Windows Users as &quot;sheep&quot;.  Well, of late, especially  
since the release of OS X and now with the release of the Intel based  
Macs, we Mac users have developed our own subgroup.  I'd call them  
&quot;ostriches&quot;.
Even though OS X was released WAY back in 2001 or so, we still have a  
core group who refuses to even try it.  They insist that OS 9 is the  
only OS that they would even consider using.  We've also developed an  
even newer subgroup who say that they can only use a G3-5 to run  
their applications and won't even consider buying a new Intel based Mac.
These people have their heads buried in the sand.  Ostriches!  The OS  
and the Mac are moving on and they're still stuck in the past.  I've  
tried to reason with these people, on this list and other lists, but  
you get nowhere.  They are convinced that their way of doing things  
has &quot;always worked in the past&quot; and think that there is no  
possibility that anything new like 'iLife 06' could in anyway be  
helpful.  They have to use their Clarisworks for email.  They can't  
use any other browser but Internet Explorer 5 for the Mac.  &quot;How can  
you even suggest that I should use anything other than Appleworks?&quot;
These are the answers you get.  So, don't waste your time.  Let time  
march on and eventually the future will come and smack them in the  
face.  Once day they'll boot up their beige G3 and it will die.   
There won't be any to replace it.  So, they'll buy a G4 or G5 off one  
of the 'swap lists' or ebay......only to find that OS 9 won't boot  
natively on it.  They'll go into a panic.....take a pill and then  
realize &quot;Hey OS X isn't that bad, I can't believe I never tried it  
before.&quot;
So, as helpful as you're trying to be, don't waste your time, it's  
like talking to the wall.  I converted somebody on the LEM G3-5  
list.......she was a die hard OS 9 user.  To her there was just  
NOTHING that could possibly compare.  An opportunity came up and I  
had an extra Quicksilver 867.  I loaded OS X on it ONLY and sent it  
to her.  She loved the computer and DID put her old OS 9 disk in the  
second drive bay and continued to use it.  Then strangely enough, you  
started seeing posts about how she is now using OS X more and  
more....even buying software for it.  I was amazed.  Of course not  
all of us can do that for the &quot;ostriches&quot; out there, but I think it  
illustrates the point that I'm trying to make here.

Tim
