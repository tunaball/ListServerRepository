<PRE>Your point is well taken. As a matter of fact the enclosures are for  
IDE/ATA drives.

This whole migration issue  got too complicated and frought with  
potential problems. And I'm very antsy to get my hands on the new  
computer.  I've gone ahead and used the manual back up of user files  
as described in the Apple support articles.

	I just &quot;restored&quot; the files to the new computer. That's done. Now I  
just have to figure out which software can be dragged over, which  
needs to be downloaded again, and which has to be reloaded from the  
original disks, and which ones have to have the new computer  
authorized in order to make it work. &lt;Sigh&gt; Oh for the good old days  
when it was easy to move apps.


&gt;<i> One thing that nobody has mentioned is the hard drive in the G5 is  
</I>&gt;<i> going to be an SATA drive.  I hope the firewire enclosure supports  
</I>&gt;<i> SATA and isn't ATA.
</I>


&gt;<i> And try to remember that bottom posting makes a message flow a lot  
</I>&gt;<i> better and you don't have to scroll up and down to see what was  
</I>&gt;<i> said first.
</I>
Actually, Tim,  I hate it when people use bottom posting. It's  
annoying when I have to scroll thru a lot of stuff just to get to  
what ever comments are there... frequently I find something inane  
like &quot;I agree with you&quot;.  I don't think you need to &quot;worry&quot; about  
having the message flow nicely. When dealing with a popular subject  
like &quot;Hikacking the thread&quot; I don't need to be repeatedly reminded  
what all the previous posts may have said. I'd rather see the comment  
first... and then if I don't understand it (and need to) I can always  
go read other posts to get the context.

Personally I'd much rather read posts  that the author has liberally  
used scissors to remove extraneous materials.



Cheers,
John
