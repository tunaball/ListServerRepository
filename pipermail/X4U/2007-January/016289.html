&gt;<i>I'm only still attached to one Classic App, and that is ClarisDraw. 
</I>&gt;<i>I have yet to find what I consider an acceptable replacement for 
</I>&gt;<i>ClarisDraw.  It is simple and easy to use, it does what I want, and I 
</I>&gt;<i>know how to make it do what I want.  At least I've managed to break 
</I>&gt;<i>myself of using Adobe PageMill 3.0, though I still prefer it to Adobe 
</I>&gt;<i>GoLive CS.
</I>

If you ever intend to upgrade to a new Macintosh, I suggest that you 
might want to wean yourself from those legacy applications now, while you 
can still find applications that can read your old files.  A few years 
from now you may find it really difficult to find something that is 
backwards compatible with your old ClarisDraw files.

I fully understand the pain that is involved with moving away from a 
much-loved and well understood application, but I can't buy the argument 
that there isn't anything as good as ClarisDraw or Adobe PageMill.  

At Macworld Expo last week I saw no less than four new draw programs 
being demoed, and though I had no real interest in them, they all looked 
really good and easy to figure out how to use.

And I used Adobe PageMill when it was current, and I've used quite a few 
Web site creation programs since, and frankly I never did think that 
PageMill was all that good, even when it was available.  There are at 
least a dozen other Web site creation programs available, several of 
which make things really easy by offering really nice templates to work 
from, and one of them has to be able to make you love it.  Though I use 
Adobe GoLive (which is, admittedly, a bear to learn to use), I just got 
Apple's iWeb (it came with my new iMac) and I am blown away at how nice 
(and easy!) it is for your average user.

I think that a little pain now will save you from a ton a pain in a few 
years, Zane, if you ever aspire to get a new Macintosh.
