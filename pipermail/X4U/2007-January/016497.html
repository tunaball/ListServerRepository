<PRE>Hi Group:

I have a bit of a dilemma.  This is just a minor annoyance with my  
Mac Pro.  Over the past few weeks, it's started to mis-behave just on  
one thing.  When I tell it to go to sleep, it won't do it  
immediately, sometimes I have to do this about 3-4 times before it  
actually goes to sleep.  Now if I press the power button, it'll go  
right to sleep without any problems and stay asleep.
Of course I bought AppleCare with it and I called them yesterday with  
this annoyance.  The tech had me do quite a few things:  we reset the  
PRAM, created a different user account, etc and nothing fixed it.   
After she put me on hold for about 5 minutes to consult with a senior  
tech specialist, she came back and told me to do an archive and re- 
install of the OS.
I really don't want to do this.  I have OS X 10.4.8 installed on a  
RAID striped setup on 2 500 gig drives.  I have tons of applications  
that I'd have to re-register (yes, I have all of the serial numbers  
and such).  But this would involve a major project and probably take  
half of the day doing something I HATE doing.
Now to my question:  OS X 10.5 is coming out in the next few weeks to  
months...I'm thinking March at the latest?  As soon as it comes out,  
I'm buying it and I'll upgrade the current OS.  Should I do as they  
told me--archive and install or just wait until I upgrade to 10.5?
After all, it's just a very minor annoyance, what is the advice of  
the group?  Would you re-install or just wait for the next OS release?

Tim
