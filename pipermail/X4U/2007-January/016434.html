Linda:
Another nice thing about the OS X mail app is that you can set up  
rules, say to have all messages from this address placed in a folder  
that you create.  Now, THAT folder can be set up to be viewed in  
Threads, but it doesn't apply universally.  So your main mailbox will  
still be viewed the same way that you're used to.
Entourage is a HOG!  Too much useless crap crammed into a poorly  
designed application...no thank you.
As a former Windows user, I didn't like Outlook either.
Also, I can't even imagine having to use 3 different mail  
applications, that must be a nightmare.  I have a total of 5 email  
addresses that I keep track of all in OS X mail.  Simple and painless  
and I can view email lists, such as this by thread....it certainly  
makes it a lot easier.
