Yes, I'm definitely picking up some install disks this week.  My wife  
also just picked up a G3 800 ibook with 10.4.8 that came without  
disks, too.  So it'll be handy for both of us.   I have no complaints  
with the speed of my machine.  Yeah, some things chugged a bit and  
I'll playfully complain about it being 'lowly', but overall I've had  
a  positive experience with it.  It works fine for what I need it for  
which is typical internet use, music, DVDs, pictures and home/farm  
office work with NeoOffice.  For games, which I have precious little  
time for with a young family (4 year old and 20 month old twins, all  
boys), I run a 2Ghz PC.

Regarding Safari, I actually preferred it to Firefox as well.  It  
just seemed to run smoother.  My only complaint was that when  
dragging a link to a tab, the page scrolled up.  A bit annoying but I  
still ran Safari until this latest problem cropped up.
