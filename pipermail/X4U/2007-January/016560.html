Right on, both points well taken.

&gt;<i> But it's ok. &quot;It's just a joke&quot;. &quot;Sense of humour, anyone?&quot;
</I>
Well, you're right on that one too.
One serious problem with attempting subtle bits of humor online is, 
there's a LOT you two don't know about each other going in.
When you can see a guy's mug, his eyes and his body language, a person 
can pretty much know whether or not the OTHER guy will take this 'joke' 
as a joke!
Or, whether he's got a chip going in...

A lot of potentially confrontational instances can be nipped in the bud 
immediately when you see the other person's face. Lots of clues on the 
face. In the muscle structure of the face and upper body, the hands.

Can't do *any* of that online. You have to wait until the person taking 
umbrage decides whether or not s/he's really ticked off, and get an 
electronic reply. Fraught with problems.

&gt;<i> One poster suggested &quot;how many PC users do you think are on this mailing 
</I>&gt;<i> list&quot;, but if that makes it ok then you'll find yourself taking that 
</I>&gt;<i> smug &amp; supercilious attitude with you elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry. I'm just sick and fucking tired of Mac users - not everyone 
</I>&gt;<i> here, but particularly on this list - making like Macs are God's gift 
</I>&gt;<i> and Mac-users God's chosen people.
</I>
Well now gee Stoller, it IS a Mac list, isn't it!
You should expect loyal and dedicated Mac owners here.
And, like Texans (and all others of their ilk) the defensive response is 
trigger quick.

&gt;<i> &quot;Black and white people regularly get in small digs at each other.&quot;
</I>
Yeah, we do, but not strangers online. THAT's touchy business...
Racial divisiveness is a whole lot worse than whether you own a Mac or 
PC....

&gt;<i> Stroller.
</I>
We gotta ease up a bit here, folks... I&quot;m certain nobody brought a slur 
to the party, it just happened and the misunderstandings flew!
