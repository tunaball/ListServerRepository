<PRE>Slightly. But then I realise he &quot;appears&quot; to be just another smug, self 
opinionated mac user and I brush it off.

In this world, there are people who have to use Windows. There are people 
who have to use Macs. There are people who have to use various iterations of 
*nix, including Linux, Unix and (showing my age now) Xenix.

We use what we have to use to get the job done that we need to do.

I have an MBP17 and a HP nx9420. Apart from the fingerprint sensor and the 
media card reader on the HP, they are the exact same hardware.

Fundamentalism, (the belief that my choice is right and everyone else is 
wrong) is just plain stupid no matter where it occurs. Whether that be in 
the choice of a computer, a political party, a religion, anywhere.

Some people get to choose what they use to do their work. Consider yourself 
lucky. The majority of Windows users don't get a choice. Their employer 
dictates what they use at work, and that generally rubs off into the home as 
well.

I had to go and see my cardiologist yesterday to check that everything was 
working OK after the operation, and I was very surprised to find that the 
office he shares uses iMacs and not Windows boxes. And yet all the people 
there complain about the Macs, because they use Windows at home and 
elsewhere and know how to use it. The Macs were put in because the owner of 
the practice likes Macs and was prepared to accept what appears to be a 
second rate practice management system because of his bias towards Macs.

Does that make him right or wrong? Doesn't matter either way, it was the 
decision he made as the owner.

One of the major advantages to a Mac is that I can run multiple operating 
systems on it. I can run Mac OS X. I can run Windows XP. I can run Windows 
Vista. I can run any version of Windows. I can run almost any version of 
Linux. And I know that it will work well, because of the hardware it is 
running on. Like the HP, the MBP is built on solid, high quality hardware. 
And it works well.

My HP has very rarely ever crashed in it's lifetime. And as a consultant, I 
abuse the heck out of it. I install stuff I shouldn't. I get attacked by 
huge numbers of viruses and malware simly because it is used as a storage 
centre for clients while their machines are being worked on. And it keeps 
chugging along.

The company I consult for puts computer networks into dental practices and 
supports them. It is very rare for us to ever have a problem that cannot be 
solved simply by a reboot. That is the simplest way I know to fix operator 
error. The servers almost never have problems because we keep the users away 
from them.

Does that make the Windows boxes that we put into the practices less good 
than a Mac? Nope. The software we support runs on windows so we deal with 
it. The previous software we supported ran on Xenix/Unix so we supported it. 
The other software run on Sun workstations so we supported it. and if the 
writer of the software decides to go to Macs, we will support that as well.

We do what we have to do and learn what we have to learn to support our 
clients to help them achieve what they want to achieve.

If a Mac does what you want, then by all means buy one. But don't denigrate 
Windows users because that is their choice.

my AU$0.02 worth.......
