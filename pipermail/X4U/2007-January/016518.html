</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this world, there are people who have to use Windows. There are 
</I>&gt;<i> people who have to use Macs. There are people who have to use various 
</I>&gt;<i> iterations of *nix, including Linux, Unix and (showing my age now) Xenix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We use what we have to use to get the job done that we need to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have an MBP17 and a HP nx9420. Apart from the fingerprint sensor and 
</I>&gt;<i> the media card reader on the HP, they are the exact same hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fundamentalism, (the belief that my choice is right and everyone else is 
</I>&gt;<i> wrong) is just plain stupid no matter where it occurs. Whether that be 
</I>&gt;<i> in the choice of a computer, a political party, a religion, anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some people get to choose what they use to do their work. Consider 
</I>&gt;<i> yourself lucky. The majority of Windows users don't get a choice. Their 
</I>&gt;<i> employer dictates what they use at work, and that generally rubs off 
</I>&gt;<i> into the home as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I had to go and see my cardiologist yesterday to check that everything 
</I>&gt;<i> was working OK after the operation, and I was very surprised to find 
</I>&gt;<i> that the office he shares uses iMacs and not Windows boxes. And yet all 
</I>&gt;<i> the people there complain about the Macs, because they use Windows at 
</I>&gt;<i> home and elsewhere and know how to use it. The Macs were put in because 
</I>&gt;<i> the owner of the practice likes Macs and was prepared to accept what 
</I>&gt;<i> appears to be a second rate practice management system because of his 
</I>&gt;<i> bias towards Macs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does that make him right or wrong? Doesn't matter either way, it was the 
</I>&gt;<i> decision he made as the owner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of the major advantages to a Mac is that I can run multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> operating systems on it. I can run Mac OS X. I can run Windows XP. I can 
</I>&gt;<i> run Windows Vista. I can run any version of Windows. I can run almost 
</I>&gt;<i> any version of Linux. And I know that it will work well, because of the 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware it is running on. Like the HP, the MBP is built on solid, high 
</I>&gt;<i> quality hardware. And it works well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My HP has very rarely ever crashed in it's lifetime. And as a 
</I>&gt;<i> consultant, I abuse the heck out of it. I install stuff I shouldn't. I 
</I>&gt;<i> get attacked by huge numbers of viruses and malware simly because it is 
</I>&gt;<i> used as a storage centre for clients while their machines are being 
</I>&gt;<i> worked on. And it keeps chugging along.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The company I consult for puts computer networks into dental practices 
</I>&gt;<i> and supports them. It is very rare for us to ever have a problem that 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be solved simply by a reboot. That is the simplest way I know to 
</I>&gt;<i> fix operator error. The servers almost never have problems because we 
</I>&gt;<i> keep the users away from them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does that make the Windows boxes that we put into the practices less 
</I>&gt;<i> good than a Mac? Nope. The software we support runs on windows so we 
</I>&gt;<i> deal with it. The previous software we supported ran on Xenix/Unix so we 
</I>&gt;<i> supported it. The other software run on Sun workstations so we supported 
</I>&gt;<i> it. and if the writer of the software decides to go to Macs, we will 
</I>&gt;<i> support that as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We do what we have to do and learn what we have to learn to support our 
</I>&gt;<i> clients to help them achieve what they want to achieve.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If a Mac does what you want, then by all means buy one. But don't 
</I>&gt;<i> denigrate Windows users because that is their choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> my AU$0.02 worth.......
