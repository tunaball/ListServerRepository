<PRE>Have you tried turning off the auto time setting on the Mac side?  
Perhaps an Automater task set up to turn Airport Connection on, set  
the time and then turn the Airport connection off?

Would it be possible for you to use Parallels and not Boot Camp?

I have a friend running Parralles which seems to work fine for him.  
He has some sort of Windows only credit card app that is not  
available for the 'lowly' Mac platform. I've been thinking of  
installing Parallels on my MacPro, but I have yet to find a Windows  
app that I can't live without, so it would just be an academic  
process for me.

An observation I have had is that a lot of the PC users I know don't  
really like the 'new' appearance that IE7 offers them. I am not sure  
of the  functionality the &quot;7&quot; update provides.
