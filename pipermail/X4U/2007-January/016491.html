This put a smile on my face.

This lowered my opinion of you.

Was there any need for that?

Was the whole purpose of your post to denigrate PCs?
Because by extension, denigrating PCs denigrates their users. There  
may be no need for it to do so, but any Windows user reading that  
post will think &quot;what's wrong with the nice new PC I just bought last  
year? it works for me&quot;. And any Windows &quot;enthusiast&quot; reading your  
post would be quite entitled to think &quot;what an arrogant bunch those  
Mac users are! how smug to think that computers which can't even  
right-click can possibly be better&quot;.

I frequently suggest to my PC-using customers that they get a Mac,  
and they just look at me sideways and say &quot;but it won't be  
compatible&quot;. Really, this is extremely fortunate for me, because I  
make my living out of PCs, and the one customer who took my advice  
has not needed to call me in the two years since. But is it  
surprising that Windows users don't understand Macs, if Mac users  
must always be so condescending?

If you wish to encourage wider Mac use then I suggest you are less  
divisive with your comments in future. And should you ever kerb the  
current to your Macintosh you will find that it, too, will not run  
with insufficient power.

And your story is an old one, anyway; do you still work with Mr  
Danielsson? &lt;<A HREF="http://searchwinit.techtarget.com/tip/">http://searchwinit.techtarget.com/tip/</A>

Stroller.




[1] And before you say &quot;it doesn't&quot; there are very many PCs out there  
which work perfectly for the purposes of word-processing, email and  
web-surfing; little old ladies are at a FAR lower risk of malware  
than families with teenage kids. Uninstall McAfee from a new &#163;400  
Dell, replace with AVG free edition and it is noticeably snapper than  
my MacBook, which was twice the price yet which suffers terribly for  
having only 512meg RAM.
