Oh c'mon, it was a joke!
PC and Mac folks regularly get in small digs at each other's choices of 
computer. No need to get all bent out of shape for something like that, 
as tho' it were personal or something.

&gt;<i> I frequently suggest to my PC-using customers that they get a Mac, and 
</I>&gt;<i> they just look at me sideways and say &quot;but it won't be compatible&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> Really, this is extremely fortunate for me, because I make my living out 
</I>&gt;<i> of PCs, and the one customer who took my advice has not needed to call 
</I>&gt;<i> me in the two years since. But is it surprising that Windows users don't 
</I>&gt;<i> understand Macs, if Mac users must always be so condescending?
</I>
Mountain out of molehill, Stroller... Cool your jets!

&gt;<i> If you wish to encourage wider Mac use then I suggest you are less 
</I>&gt;<i> divisive with your comments in future. And should you ever kerb the 
</I>&gt;<i> current to your Macintosh you will find that it, too, will not run with 
</I>&gt;<i> insufficient power.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And your story is an old one, anyway; do you still work with Mr 
</I>&gt;<i> Danielsson?
