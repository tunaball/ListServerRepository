<PRE>Unless you need the rack mount capability or any of the other  
features (hot swappable power supplies, etc) that make the X-Server a  
'server' instead of a 'workstation . . .then I think that a Mac Pro  
(or heck, even an iMac) would make a find server for a 6 practitioner  
medical practice.

File sharing, mail if you need it, Filemaker Pro server . . .a Mac  
Pro will handle all of that just fine.

As to remote management . . .you can always buy a copy of OS X Server  
and install on it . . .but unless remote administration is a real  
requirement then there probably isn't anything that actually requires  
the Server vice Client version of OS X.

You could use the XServe as a regular workstation . . .but the extra  
fans it has and the 'must be rack mounted' case make it probably a  
less than satisfactory workstation.

Based on your statements of the needs and requirements . . .the X- 
Serve is nice . . . but way overkill. Performance wise . . .even a  
Mac Mini would probably be more than sufficient. An iMac is  
definitely sufficient . . .but you might want to buy the Mac Pro so  
that you can have multiple drives for backup, redundancy, etc.

</I>&gt;<i> Most of the clients for the appointments program will be on

</I>&gt;<i> well be

</I>&gt;<i> there's as
