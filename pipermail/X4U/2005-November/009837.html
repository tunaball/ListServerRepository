I've tried this.. doesn't show much of anything going on at all..   
there are a a few processes owned by the admin account that is  
attempting to log in. But nothing appears to be heavily in use at all.


&gt;<i> Another idea, though far more silly and perhaps useless is to look  
</I>&gt;<i> at your problem account's files, and see what the most recently

</I>
well I've been trying to remove any Preferences and the like in some  
of the applications that were last running in this admin account.   I  
keep thinking it has something to do with the enabling all the fonts  
that I temporarily enabled using Font Book while logged into this  
account.    It was a lot of fonts. lots of disk thrashing etc.  But  
everything appeared to be working o.k.  And before I restarted that  
last time, I removed the Font Library that I had enabled.  in my  
attempt to hopefully AVOID any problems in the FUTURE with having all  
those fonts enabled.

is there some LOG FILE I could be looking at while attempting to  
start up this account..  that I could watch via an SSH session from  
another computer ?
