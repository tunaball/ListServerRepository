<PRE>Aaron,

Thanks for the tip regarding using Panther's calculator. After you posted
that, I copied over the calculator from my Panther machine to my Tiger
machine and it works fine (and, more importantly, the way I prefer). I
originally did the same with Key Caps from Jaguar to Panther. Now if only I
could copy Panther's Find File functionality to Tiger ...

It's obvious that this issue is about as contentious as canned cranberry
sauce vs. fresh cranberry sauce. Neither is necessarily &quot;correct,&quot; but those
who prefer one will disparage the other. Personally, I fail to see the point
in having a % button if all it does is move the decimal point two places.
That doesn't provide any use at all, in my opinion, and saves no keystrokes.
In fact, just today I had an advertising contact call me up and said I could
take 15% off a certain rate. Normally, I would type the number, subtract
15%, which is the way I've been doing it for years. With the new Tiger
calculator, I would have to change my thought to creating a proper
mathematical written equation of the number * .85
If folks want to use a calculator like that, they certainly can. I don't see
why having the percent key work as it previously did would hinder them in
any way, especially since they don't even need to enter scientific mode.

I guess you're telling the truth about recently joining this list, if you
think this thread is off-topic or overblown. There have been far less
relevant discussions that lasted longer ('&gt;'s or ':'s in e-mail replies,
anyone?) If you want moderated, strictly, OS X-only discussion, I recommend

</I>&gt;<i> Approxiamately 56 hours ago, Eddie Hargreaves &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x4u.html">meged at earthlink.net</A>&gt; posted a

</I>&gt;<i> (I don't mean to get nasty, but I DO mean to be critical!)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there any reason why Panther's Calculator.app can't be used in Tiger?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since I'm new to OS X (though not to either Mac OS or UNIX) there may be some

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can't try it for myself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm curious to know (without reading another 60 or so messages) to know if
</I>&gt;<i> anyone has answered my question, which, IM(not-so)HO, does relate to the
</I>&gt;<i> purpose of this list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - Aaron
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. Can anyone tell me how to set the preferences on my
</I>&gt;<i> listserver.themacintoshguy.com account(s) so that I receive ALL messages from
</I>&gt;<i> the listserver, including those I post and those Cc'd to me by the poster?
</I>&gt;<i> The obvious settings haven't worked.
