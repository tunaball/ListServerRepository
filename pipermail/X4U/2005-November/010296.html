<PRE>oh, brother...yes, '4%' does have meaning, but I'm pretty sure you  
know the sense in which I meant &quot;no meaning.&quot;

Let's say you're going for a job and you're told that your pay will  
be 4%. First thing you'd ask, if you had any sense, would be &quot;4% OF  
what??&quot; Person hiring you says, &quot;No..just 4%. But rest assured,  
because 4% is always 4/100, or 0.04. So...when do you start?&quot;

So, there's your meaning. You know you're being hired for 4%. But  
until you know what it's 4% OF, the meaning isn't specific enough for  
you to  sign on.

It could be 4% of the company's gross, 4% of the CEO's income, 4% of  
what your secretary makes, or 4% of the cost of urinal cakes in the  
mens' room.

A percent can be thought of as a formula or as an operator. Yes, it  
has a definition, but until or unless you know what it's operating  
on, you don't have specific value.
