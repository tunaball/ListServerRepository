<PRE>Could sure use some suggestions here. I'll try to be brief but to the  
point..

was running 10.4.2  (assuming that was the version)
everything was just fine and has been for a long time.

I connected to another Mac on my network.  Using FONTBOOK..  I  
enabled a folders worth of fonts.  Played around in font book for  
awhile. used text edit briefly, using some of the new fonts I had  
enabled.
When I was done I &quot;DELETED&quot; the newly created font library.

I was thinking about installing the new 10.4.3 update, but before I  
did that, I went to RESTART my computer.
after restarting, I went to log in.   the desktop picture changes to  
what it is supposed to, but NOTHING LOADS.  no dock, no finder etc..   
after a minute or so I can see just the SPOTLIGHT icon in the upper  
right hand corner of my screen.     If I drag the mouse over it, I  
get a spinning beachball.     nothing else loads, and I've waited  
around for about 2 hours. Nothing changes. nothing loads. And  
dragging the mouse over the spotlight icon still produces a spinning  
beachball.


I force restarted..  I can log into other accounts on the computer.   
I was able to create a new ADMIN account.   checked/repaired  
permissions.   Have installed the new 10.4.3 update.
I still can't log in to my ORIGINAL admin account.   just the  
spotlight icon shows up.. and moving the mouse over it displays a  
spinning beach ball.

ANY SUGGESTIONS on how I find out what is keeping this account from  
logging in ?      I've been thinking maybe if I could kill spotlight  
or something ?  If that is what is actually causing the problem.  I  
guess this, only because it's the only thing that shows up.. and does  
nothing but give me a beach ball.

Kansast
