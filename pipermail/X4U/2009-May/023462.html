<PRE>Hi there,

I know that spam is everywhere, and we've all gotten tired of getting it,
and tired of reporting it. I just want to share with you a positive note on
the aspect of reporting it!

This morning, I got an email (obviously a fake because they spelled &quot;Mac&quot; in
all caps -- MAC -- which we know Apple never does!) telling me that my
.Mac/MobileMe account was reaching its capacity, and that I needed to email
my password so that I could be authorized for more storage space. It's
creative, at least, but I knew it was spam.

I forwarded the message, with long headers, to <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x4u.html">abuse at apple.com</A> and
<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x4u.html">spam at me.com</A>, and received replies from both of them! I really like the calm,
succinct reply from apple:

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for contacting Apple's Product Security Team. Apple takes
</I>&gt;<i> every report of a potential security problem very seriously.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The email message you received did not originate from Apple.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no further action needed after deleting the message, Apple
</I>&gt;<i> Legal and Apple Corporate Security have been alerted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple Product Security team
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/security/">http://www.apple.com/support/security/</A>
</I>
It was nice to hear from them. I'm a bit &quot;jaded&quot; and am so used to hearing
nothing from companies when I forward in spam, that this was a refreshing
bright spot in my day.

Apple does care!

~Linda
