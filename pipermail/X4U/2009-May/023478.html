Jen:

I know that. That is not the issue the issue was permissions. Like  
someone suggested I created another folder and the move was  
successful. I am not sure your analogy is spot on.
What I also did was to move one file in and it seemed to work without  
issue. I would have expected that if any of the files were successful  
in the first move they would have moved and the unsuccessful ones  
would not. In my case none of them moved. I am at a lost to explain  
why one was successful but when all were tried nothing got moved. I  
do not pretend to understand the finder but it did seem inconsistent  
(I hate inconsistency). What I ended up doing was copying the  
contents of the folder to a new folder and did a drag and dropped and  
of course everything copied. I was able to delete the problem folder  
with no issue I, so I am guessing that the folder was not the issue.  
If it wouldn't delete then I guess it makes sense. I wanted to keep  
the date of the folder to be in sync with the other folders but I was  
not able to. SO I cannot sort by date anymore (and get correct view) :(

ps: has anyone else noted an extremely delay in receiving emails from  
the listserv or is it me?
