<PRE>Daly:

Yes I know. Thanks.. I am curious as to why item(s) like this did not  
come up during testing. It seems (to me anyway) that this should have  
been an issue for the developer to address. I am rally getting bummed  
out on the shareware out there that has seen either no use or little  
us. Considering that Apple essentially gives you a similar feature  
(albeit not allowing you to name the file that would be the first  
thing I would add to any product that and where the zip file is going  
to go. I can sort of understand if the default was where the input  
was but again it would be mandatory to let the user specify where the  
persons wants to put the zip file.  Maybe I am over thinking this and  
giving developers too much credit as in a previous life we actually  
talked with the enduser (as well as other people) before giving them  
something to test out.
Not to get too far off the subject but one time I was asked to go and  
talked to the user and make sure their requirements fitted out  
understanding of a deliverable. It wasn't even close so rather than  
going back empty handed I sat down with the user and went through the  
needs and I was able to come up with what they wanted with no issue  
and got them the product in a reasonable amount of tim. Was there a  
lot of code change &quot;lot&quot; is hard to quantify but it essentially added  
4 hours and 2 hours desk checking and about 4 hours of testing. The  
user was thrilled and only wanted to talk with me from then on. I had  
to schedule my time around theirs as they were facing the customers  
so that meant early in the AM or after the bank closed. I only had to  
get clearance to be on the floor during off hours which was trickier  
than I thought as I was only allowed if I was an officer of the bank  
and that took about 1 month. It was fun to be around the people that  
routinely handled millions of dollars a day:) In my old job(part  
time) I regularly handled 10-50 checks a day that were over a million  
so it was no big thing for me.

</I>&gt;<i> Well, you could write to the developer about the issue of where it
