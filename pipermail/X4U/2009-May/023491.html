Joe:

Thanks but I was guessing a little of what you said. One of the items  
that I think people have indicated that is probably a little out of  
date is the statement &quot;per CPU&quot;.
While in the past that may have been valid in todays processors that  
is (IMO) incorrect. INTEL, AMD and others have come out with  
multiprocessors which contain more than one CPU.

One of the main differences between the micro processors and others  
is that OEMs have serial numbers attached to each processor. So a  
program has to be aware any and all cpus that it could essentially  
run on at execution time. This stops &quot;theft&quot; of programs as it will  
only run on a specific CPU. Which I guess is great for the owners but  
a PITA for users. As every time you add processor(s) you have to  
essentially get a new key. I know one manufacture that has (last time  
I heard and it may have increased) 50 CPU's. Of course in a cloud  
computing environment it could be 100's or thousands (or more). BTW  
each new processor you add it costs more money (at least that is the  
environment I am aware of).

Which brings me back to the original question which got sort of way  
laid. Since software vendors keep the licensing information in the  
preferences each new user will have to key in the serial numbers.  
This might be OK for a small situation (one or two users say) but  
what happens if it goes to 100's or 1000's. Do you really want  
outside users having access to that type of information? It means (to  
me) that say you have a vendor and they charge (take a number) X and  
say X is a healthy number say $1,000.00 (US) so if that program is  
useful outside of the environment (work lets say) what is to stop the  
user from using the unlock key in other environments (say home)? The  
legal issues would alone be a nightmare for a company.
