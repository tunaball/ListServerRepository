I am not aware of the exact method the finder uses to store files in  
folders. My guess is, based on what you have just provided, that the  
links to that particular folder became corrupt, which would explain  
why you were having problems.

I believe utilities exist to change the attributes of folders so you  
could alter the creation date of the folder.

Also I see you replied to this thread and your reply took over a week  
to be posted. Not sure why that would be happening, perhaps someone  
else on the list would have knowledge on this?
