<PRE>&gt;<i>I am hoping someone can help me find software 
</I>&gt;<i>that will allow me to reveal passwords. We often 
</I>&gt;<i>have teachers who have forgotten their passwords 
</I>&gt;<i>over the summer and it would be nice if we could 
</I>&gt;<i>retrieve that information for them, especially 
</I>&gt;<i>for their connection to the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I found lots of software for Windows machines, 
</I>&gt;<i>but none for the Mac. For Windows, you drag the 
</I>&gt;<i>cursor over the asterisks and the password is 
</I>&gt;<i>revealed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks for your help!

As someone else noticed, Unix (and therfore Mac 
OS X)does not store the password as such but only 
stores the value that comes of sending the 
password through a one way hash algorithm.
Many confuse this with an encrypted password, but 
there is an important difference. WHen a password 
is encrypted, it is possible to decrypt it and 
restore the original password if you know how.
Hopefully, without knowing the password in the 
first place, it will be very HARD to do so, but 
it can be done. This is because there is a 
one-to-one relationship between the password and 
the ncrypted password; two different passwords 
will ALWAYS result in two different encrypted 
values.

With a hash algorithm, this is not the case. 
Several different passwords might result in the 
same hash value, and therefore it is inherrently 
impossible to &quot;decrypt&quot; the hash value and get 
the original input. So, as was said before, what 
you do is to compare the hash value of what the 
user enters as his password to the hash value of 
what was originally entered. Yes, in theory you 
might neter the wrong password and still gain 
entry, but the likelyjood is very, very small.
Probably not much greater that the chance of 
accidently hitting on the right password in an 
encrypted setup.

Now why woould you want to make it impossible 
fopr the server owner to recreate the password 
for a user? It seems like a stupid idea because
a) It is a nice service to the user to be able to 
restore his original password in stead of giving 
him a new one
and
b) The serv er owner has access to everything 
anyway, so why keep the passwords from him?
The answer is simple: We all tend to use the same 
password for many different things. This means 
that if you as the server owner have access to 
the passwords your users chose for access to the 
file server, then chances are that you  also know 
the passwords they use for their mail accounts, 
their home banking and a host of other private 
data that should be none of your bussiness! ;-)

That's why it is bad security to allow the IT 
department to read peoples' passwords, and that's 
why many systems use hashed passwords in stead of 
encrypted passwords. I repeat: It is NOT a  good 
thing that you can find such utilities for 
Windows, it is really, really bad security!

So hopefully you will not be able to find 
anything that easy&#237;ly lets you restore a password 
from a MAc OS X server!

Returning the utility that can read the password 
behind the asterisks in  a log in dialog, that's 
a different story. It would depend on how the 
application stores the password! In the simplest 
solutions, you just use a special font which 
shows the same symbol for all ASCII values. 
Simply replacu&#237;ng the font with something else 
may be enough to revale the password. In some 
cases youcan even copy the text and paste it into 
a text editor and gain access to it that way 
)although that's fairly rare these days, thank 
god!).
The point is that this is NOT related to the way 
the password is stored on the server but to the 
way the password is stored an presented in the 
application.

If the programmer has done hi work poorly, then 
you may be able to create a utility that can 
restore this kind of password. Wheteher that is 
the case for any Mac OS X applications I don't 
know, but I wouldn't hope so.
