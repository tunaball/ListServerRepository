I'm not sure how long until I can demo it.  It won't be soon enough! :^)  I
was going to ask you about how it handles fonts, but realized I'd probably
just wait and answer those questions for myself.

&gt;<i> Numbers is not bad, but I don't think I'm going to get as much use  
</I>&gt;<i> out of it. Like Pages '06, the emphasis seems to be on style over  
</I>&gt;<i> substance. It may just be me, but 90% of the time I'm in Excel it's

Ugh!  Well, it's not like I have to give up Excel 2004.  As I mentioned
previously, ClarisWorks can do everything I need.  Even once I switch to an
Intel-based system I know Excel 2004 is more than I need.

&gt;<i> If you haven't upgraded to 10.4.10 and/or Quicktime 7.2 yet, do that

</I>&gt;<i> with anything less.
</I>
This could slow me down, though I think/hope I've already upgraded.

Thanks for the first impressions Judi!  You covered the two I care about,
Keynote isn't targeted at what I need.
