No. Randy got called out personally after he took the first swings.  
He didn't just offer to help clear up their Word problems, he  
personally insulted those that weren't interested in hacking Word for  
better performance. If you have to read a website with tips &amp; tricks  
to make an application work in an acceptable manner, then the problem  
is with the application, not the user. He responded to application  
criticism with personal criticism, as if he were personally offended  
that his favorite word processor wasn't the same as everyone else's.  
That's where I had a problem.

I happen to agree with you 100% Linda. I'm not interested in  
converting anyone. As frustrated as I get with Word's performance  
issues on my MacBook Pro, I can't find an acceptable substitute  
(which is what I said in my blog post that got me into this silly  
thread in the first place). I like Word 2004 a lot, actually. I like  
the floating Formatting palette, I like the Notebook view. I've never  
had any problems with compatibility between my colleagues using  
Office 2003. I would be quite happy, frankly, if Word 2008 was  
nothing more than an Intel-native version of Word 2004 with Office  
2007 compatibility. There's no reason to make change for change's  
sake, especially if that has anything to do with the date slip (which  
from all reports, it doesn't).
