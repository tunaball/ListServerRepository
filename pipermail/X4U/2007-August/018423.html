I just looked through all of the documentation regarding producing a  
greeting card in iPhoto 08.  Nowhere in the documentation does it say  
that you can print your own.  I guess you can, but they're not going  
to come out correctly.  Do you not see the button at the end that  
says &quot;Buy Card&quot;?  I believe that Apple feels, and rightly so, that  
they can produce a much better product for you than you can at home.   
However mistaken that concept might be:  a lot of us have HIGH  
quality printers that give excellent results.  But it seems as though  
they want you to let them produce the card(s) for you and them ship  
them back.
Now I have used their services in the past to order prints, a  
calendar and one of their books.  What came back (in about 3 days or  
so) was very high quality output.  So, yes they do a very good job.   
But should they take the ability for us to produce this same output  
at home?  I think the answer is no.  I thought the whole idea was  
about choice--fine, we should ALSO have the choice to produce our own  
output, but this seems to have been limited with the release of iLife  
08.  Though there are vast improvements, I think it would be wise to  
hold on to your copy of iLife 06.
