I think this is a clear &amp; accurate analysis indicating the problem.  
Thank you for posting such an informative report - it helps us very  
easily help you.

The IP can - and in this case should - be changed on the printer.

How much do you know about IP addresses &amp; subnet masks?

The printer &amp; the Mac's ethernet port should be on the same subnet,  
but a different one from the airport. All should be allocated private  
addresses, such as 10.x.y.z or 192.168.x.y

In System Preferences &gt; Network on the Mac DON'T TOUCH ANY OF THE  
AIRPORT SETTINGS, since the user has never complained of his internet  
failing. Check that the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0

Providing the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 for the Airport then this  
will work, otherwise come back to me:

In System Preferences &gt; Network on the Mac go into the WIRED ETHERNET  
and set the IP address to be 192.168.99.42 with subnet mask  
255.255.255.0
Set the printer's IP to be 192.168.99.105 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0

Configuration should now be straight-forward.

192.0.0.192 seems to be some kind of &quot;special&quot; reserved IP address  
for printing (or advertising printing services on the network)? - I  
have never encountered it before and have always simply assigned a  
proper IP address to it as described above. This is a good &amp; correct  
practice - I don't think there's any advantage - and possible  
problems - trying to match your Mac's IP address to that range.

There is a menu option on the printer to print a sample page which  
shows it's default paper size, lots of other stuff, and the full  
network settings.
