If you read the posts, you will find that not all Word users are  
having problems with Word's launch speed, or overall speed.  Only a  
very few.  As with any program that folks have problems with (and  
Word isn't, by far, the only one), there are known ways to fix those  
problems...and then the problems are gone.

I offered to help with this.  It's easy to fix.

You literally said that you (and all other Mac users!) would rather  
complain about Word than fix it.  I don't think that's true about all  
Mac users.  And, I wonder about anyone who would rather complain  
instead of get their work done...

Folks here responded by saying that I'm trying to tell all Mac users  
to use Microsoft products, and that I'm trying to speak for all Mac  
users.  That isn't at all the case.  In fact, I don't think that  
anyone who does not need a high-end word processor should be using  
Word at all.  And if someone does use Word, they should get some  
training to learn how to use it, rather than have to fight with it  
and complain about it.  Training is easy to find, and inexpensive.  I  
gave a suggestion on where to get that too.

I  think that some folks are blind with Microsoft bigotry, and too  
caught up being mindless Apple fan-boys.  Personally I like to get my  
work done, and I'm happy to help those who want to do the same.
