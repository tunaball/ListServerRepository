Apple has stated that they are in the Blu-Ray camp, but they appear  
to be waiting for the standards war to shake out, and for hardware  
prices to come down, before offering hardware that supports either  
standard.

A winner in the standards war is by no means certain at this point.

Don't they already?

A couple of manufacturers are offering players that support both  
standards already, but they are expensive.  The two sides don't  
currently seem amenable to coming up with a compromise standard with  
room for both.

&gt;<i> 3) What platforms would other users purchase?
</I>
Currently Blu-Ray has an arguable lead in the war in that Sony is  
behind this standard and millions of customers already have Blu-Ray  
players in their homes in the form of a Play Station 3  console.   
Sony also is one of the major content providers in the movie  
industry, owning Colombia Pictures, which gives them an advantage in  
pushing their standard.  In addition, Blockbuster recently announced  
that they will only be carrying Blu-Ray DVD's, not HD.
<A HREF="http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/17/blockbuster-chooses-blu-ray-is-the-">http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/17/blockbuster-chooses-blu-ray-is-the-</A>

Microsoft and Intel back the competing HD DVD format.  Given the  
virtual monopoly position that both enjoy, they could decide to make  
HD DVD the de facto standard for PC's and then easily enforce it by  
only offering PC software and hardware products that support HD.   
Microsoft could also tilt the advantage the Blu-Ray currently enjoys  
by including a HD DVD player in a future version of the X-Box.

So, for now, it is too early to bet heavily on one over the other.
