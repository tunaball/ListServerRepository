Okay, whatever programs you choose (she for server, you for client - 
I like using her Apple Remote Desktop (in the Sharing system pref) 
and Chicken of the VNC or VNCthing or OSX vnc as the client (your 
end) ) will probably tell you what ports need to be forwarded. I do 
it on my iMac by going to Applications/Utilities/Airport Admin 
Utility, where can set up &quot;port mapping&quot; under the Configure tab in 
the Port mapping subtab.

She needs to know her local IP address (which is under System 
Prefernces/Networking/TCP-IP/
and her router's IP address. Probably the easiest way to get that is 
to go in any browser to:
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.whatismyip.com">http://www.whatismyip.com</A>&gt;

She needs to forward any traffic on the VNC port from the public IP 
address to her private IP address (10.0.1.x). The 10.0-.0.1 I somehow 
doubt is her actual personal IP address but might belong to another 
device on her network.

Here's a URL that talks about this:  &lt; 
<A HREF="http://www.realvnc.com/support/portforward.html">http://www.realvnc.com/support/portforward.html</A>&gt;

I gather that the ports that need to be forwarded to her own private 
addres are:  5900 and 5901. I&quot;m sure someone else will chime in and 
correct or expand this information.

But the idea is that she needs to tell the router to take any traffic 
to the VNC ports and route it to her personal IP address.

If she is not connected wirelessly, then I'm not sure what utility 
she should use for doing the port forwarding. Maybe in a browser 
connection to the admin page for her router?

How IS she connected to the internet?
