</I>Excuse me, I've been using the Mac Platform since 2001.  I may not  
have been using it as LONG as some of you but I certainly know quite  
a bit about it and how the various applications on the Mac work.
Excuse also the fact that since I switched over to using only Intel  
based Macs and have noted how much faster and more responsive a  
program written as a Universal Binary runs and reacts, that I am  
somewhat put off with any company that can't have the decency to  
update their software to suit MY computing needs.
While many of you have expressed your various NEED to continue to use  
Word and other Office 2004 applications, I do not have that need.
I used to use Outlook, Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint et al, back  
before I switched, once again in 2001 (That six years for anybody who  
can't do the math), as it was the accepted standard on any PC.
We Mac users, however, have a CHOICE in regard to what software we  
use.  I have chosen to abandon Office 2004 and am now using Mariner  
Write and Mariner Calc as VERY ACCEPTABLE substitutes for Word and  
Excel.
So, Mr. Singer, while I appreciate your concern that I might not  
understand the workings of a computing platform that I have been  
using for the past 6 years, let me assure you that I am fully aware  
on what is going on behind the scenes.
Microsoft is concerned that their new version of Office (which I have  
seen already in Vista--that being Office 2007) might not function as  
well as they would like.  Believe me, having seen Office 2007 running  
in Vista, I am none too pleased with the MAJOR changes that have  
taken place.  I hope that you are aware that many documents written  
using Office 2003 (PC edition) are no longer compatible with Office  
2007 because of the restructuring that they have done?
I believe the Mac Community will be in an uproar when Office 2008 or  
2009 or 2010 actually comes out and learns that nothing that they  
previously composed is compatible.
So, I will close by stating that I do &quot;think different&quot; and will not  
be one of the sheep being herded over to Office 200? by the likes of  
you.
