I'm not convinced of this particular influence, although I'm  
obviously not able to comment from personal experience on a US  
perspective. And obviously the US is the biggest and most influential  
market. The PS3 is lagging behind the Wii in sales and here I even  
know of people using them with standard-def tellies - in gaming it's  
often said &quot;it's the games, stupid&quot; which sell the platform. Plenty  
of people who have bought into the whole hi-def telly thing only have  
720p sets, and I'm unconvinced of the advantage of hi-def content on  
those, compared to a 576p DVD viewed through a good upscaler. Finally  
the majority of PS3s are bought for the kids and middle-aged parents  
have no interest in them - for these folks DVDs already offer all the  
convenience they need and hi-def formats offer little additional  
advantage over VHS.

&gt;<i> Sony also is one of the major content providers in the movie  
</I>&gt;<i> industry, owning Colombia Pictures, which gives them an advantage  
</I>&gt;<i> in pushing their standard.  In addition, Blockbuster recently

Indeed. There were rumours a while back about Walmart offering a $299  
HD-DVD player, placing an order for 2million units. Although this  
rumour was subsequently scotched - and reduced to a statement that  
Wal-Mart merely inquired about a Chinese manufacturer's ability to  
&quot;provide a schedule&quot; along with &quot;cost and quantity&quot; details - it  
would significantly change the landscape of the format war.
<A HREF="http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/26/fuh-yuan-retracts-299-wal-mart-hd-">http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/26/fuh-yuan-retracts-299-wal-mart-hd-</A> 
dvd-statement/

IIRC I've read that - perhaps due to the licensing restrictions &amp;  
costs of the two formats? - HD-DVD is a more interesting &amp; practical  
proposition for Chinese mass-manufacturers, so if they were to get  
production capacity ramped up quickly enough it would stuff Sony &amp;  
their Blu-Ray plans. The studios will sell movies on whichever format  
consumers are able to view, and if HD-DVD players were to outsell Blu- 
Ray by a factor of three or four then even Sony's film-making arm  
will have to come into line.
