&gt;<i> I'm a tech for our publishing co, and besides print media, we also own a small radio station. My area of expertise is in print media, but I'm interested in getting into video. Our primary goal with video at the time being is to supplement and enhance local news articles on the radio station's website with 1-2 minute video snippets using our Youtube account. I am considering some of the consumer camcorders since they are relatively inexpensive and I could easily afford to outfit several reporters and sales representatives. I'm guessing the high end several thousand dollar a piece cameras would be over kill for our needs. We do use a Flip Video camera for a few things, but I'm wanting something with a decent traditional optical zoom.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anything I should consider when purchasing a consumer level camcorder? I'm leaning towards the Canon and JVC models. I've checked Apple's iMovie 09 compatibility list of recorders they've tested with iMovie, however, I notice that the current models on display in area stores are a bit newer than the ones listed on Apple's list. I'm guessing new versions should work OK? For most stuff, I'd probably be able to use just QuickTime to clip and save just the section of video I want, and use iMovie to add some transitions and intros if I want to get a little more polish.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The primary editing machine will be my MacBook Pro. I've added extra memory and have a largest hard drive available from Apple. It is a 13&quot; model that is hooked up to an external 24&quot; WideScreen LCD when I'm in the office. It has the SD memory card slot, should I take that into consideration when choosing a camera? I'm running Snow Leopard.

We have reporters using Canon HF100 cameras, with the Canon Wide Angle adapter installed. We chose those because they were cheaper than their bigger brother (HF11) with the onboard memory, and they have lots of manual capability, plus have Microphone in and Headphone out.

This camera uses SD cards to store data, and when we are done shooting I just burn a DVD of the card for archival purposes. Because of this, I would limit your SD cards to 4-8gb, to fit on a DVD. Otherwise someone might use up all 16GB of the card and you would have to figure some other way of archiving. Works pretty well.

SD slot on board is nice, but not necessary, as SD card readers are about $15.
