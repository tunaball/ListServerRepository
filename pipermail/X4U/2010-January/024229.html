One secret was to run the 'macsbugs' debugger (I think that's the 
right name.  When running it, I could kill most programs that crashed 
without taking the system down.  Another thing was to always have a 
current backup of your system disk, and if a &quot;upgrade&quot; made it less 
stable, back it out.  One of the big things, and this is something I 
do with Mac OS X as well, is to avoid 3rd party extensions.  I also 
stripped the OS down to the absolute bare minimum, so that it only 
had what I needed.

The end result, a rock solid Rev.0 G4/450 AGP (and when I say Rev.0, 
I mean so early it shipped with System 8.6, rather than 9).  I can't 
remember at the moment if I stayed at 9, or I made it to 9.1, I know 
it wasn't quite as current as it could have been as that made it less 
stable.  IIRC, the only reason I even moved to Mac OS 9 was for 
iTunes.

I found that they lack of true multitasking could be used to my 
advantage.  The app I was actively using tended to get an unfair 
share of the CPU, and yet stuff got done in the background.  What is 
not to like about that?

I also dislike how there are a lot of unnecessary features in Mac OS 
X that you can't really turn off.
