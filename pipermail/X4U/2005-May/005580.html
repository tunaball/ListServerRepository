<PRE>10.3.9 broke java...even with apple's fix there are widespread 
problems accessing certain websites. i've got the shops we support 
frozen at 10.3.8.

are your users logging in with admin privs? if you're running classic 
on your build, all bets are off. too many issues with classic.

&gt;<i>Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>LOTUS NOTES
</I>&gt;<i>Anyone else using Lotus Notes for email on 10.3.9? I recently upgraded and
</I>&gt;<i>found it broke my Secure Client. I found a Apple chat session showing the
</I>&gt;<i>fix but haven't tried it yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>When I connect my PBook 15&quot; to work's network in the morning and begin
</I>&gt;<i>surfing emails I have found that moving from one email to another causes
</I>&gt;<i>the clock to spin. It will eventually time out with an error that it
</I>&gt;<i>couldn't find the server in a specific amount of time. I can also hit
</I>&gt;<i>command-period when the clock is spinning and it brings up dialogue - user
</I>&gt;<i>interrupted error. However I can then immediately click on another email
</I>&gt;<i>then back onto the one that I was trying to view and I see it promptly. If
</I>&gt;<i>I move on quickly to other emails I can get through a few before it begins
</I>&gt;<i>timing out again. If I sit on a single email for a 30 secs or more it will
</I>&gt;<i>time out again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Having to force stop, click away then back on the email I want to read is
</I>&gt;<i>frustrating and time wasting - especially when I have hundreds of email to
</I>&gt;<i>get through. Quitting/relaunching Lotus Notes doesn't make a difference.
</I>&gt;<i>Usually a restart will get it performing properly again but this morning I
</I>&gt;<i>had to restart twice before it would behave. Seems like something is not
</I>&gt;<i>waking happy when I wake the PB first thing in the morning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This clearly began happened after upgrading to 10.3.9.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>JAVA CHAT
</I>&gt;<i>Last night my wife was using my 15&quot; PB at home to log onto her Uni site to
</I>&gt;<i>do a Java-based chat session with the teacher. However, after logging into
</I>&gt;<i>the room she was not able to submit chat text. It showed she had entered
</I>&gt;<i>the room, in fact she left the session then came back in but was in the
</I>&gt;<i>list twice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>She moved back to our home Mac (still on 10.3.7) and her chat went fine.
</I>&gt;<i>She has used my Mac before the 10.3.9 upgrade in this same chat room and
</I>&gt;<i>all went fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have already run the security update and the Java update for 10.3.9 but
</I>&gt;<i>I may still be experiencing java related issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Any thoughts on either issue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Coj
