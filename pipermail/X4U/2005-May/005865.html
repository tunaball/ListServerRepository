I don't know, is it?  My guess is it uses up some 
amount of resources.  I also rather assume that 
it's impossible to disable Expose.  I can live 
with that, what I really want to disable is 
Dashboard.

The point is that there should be a way to 
disable these features that users consider 
worthless, and I don't mean some weird hack, it 
should be included with the base OS.

Huh?  The Developer Tools are part of the base 
OS, however, they're not installed by default. 
The price therefore is my finding the time to get 
the DVD back out and figure out how to install 
them.

The Installer should have figured out that had 
the Developer Tools installed, and asked if I 
wanted to install them.  I'm fairly sure, they 
aren't even an optional choice.

It sounds more like you were waiting on Tiger to 
upgrade.  In my case I bought the hard drive so I 
could easily back out of the Tiger upgrade if it 
broke to many things.  Sure it's unfair to say 
that the upgrade cost me $320, however, like I 
said, I'd have been better off spending that 
money on more RAM rather than 10.4.

Having said that, &quot;Spotlight&quot; did help me find a 
MS Excel file last night, since it allowed me to 
search for all Excel Workbook files.  Was it 
faster than just going and looking for it?  I 
quite honestly don't know about that.  I had to 
wait while it went out to lunch on me, the 
interface seems a bit of a mess.
