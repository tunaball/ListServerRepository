<PRE>Have you actually used Tiger? I find it's much faster than Panther.  
Spotlight is very useful. I've found it works much better than the  
old find. I don't seem to have a problem with it bogging down as I  
type. The way it organizes and displays results works much better for  
me. Widgets are kind of fun but no big thing. I finally feel  
comfortable switching to Mail. It now mostly fits the way I work.

I have found that each successive iteration of OS X has been an  
improvement. I understand that you are asking a genuine question. Let  
me pose one in return. Why do you feel that Tiger may be sub par?
