Why not?

</I>
To each his own conclusion-you've already decided there aren't any
improvements. Start with
&lt;<A HREF="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars">http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars</A>&gt;. There are many,
beneath-the-hood improvements, even if the eye-candy doesn't appeal to you.

&gt;<i> In fact, all I see is some &quot;gussy-ing up&quot; with
</I>&gt;<i> knick-knacks that seem to only serve to bog down the OS and the user
</I>&gt;<i> experience. What am I missing?
</I>&gt;<i> My concern is that if we Mac users blindly jump on sub-par updates,

</I>&gt;<i> particular about what we accept as upgrades to our Mac operating
</I>&gt;<i> systems.
</I>
You assume too much and have predisposed conclusions. Why do you think
upgrading is &quot;blindly&quot; jumping in? Your choice to upgrade or not-no one's
holding a gun to your head and making you do it.

&gt;<i> I liked Jaguar, and I like Panther better than Jaguar. Does any Tiger
</I>&gt;<i> user like it better than they liked Panther? Why?
</I>
 If you were happy with Jaguar, why did you switch to Panther? Use the same
decision process to decide whether or not you want to go from Panther to
Tiger.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not intended as a rant, rather, it is put forward as concerned
</I>&gt;<i> discussion. Please address it as such. Thanks.
</I>
