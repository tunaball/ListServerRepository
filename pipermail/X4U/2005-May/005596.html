<PRE>Tiger finally arrived from Amazon yesterday afternoon, so you know where my night went.

I also experienced some unexpected disk space issues.  I did install the additional drivers and languages, but the languages were already there, and the print drivers were only a few hundred meg according to the installer, so it shouldn't have been an issue there.

Also, it said it was going to need 2.9 GB, and I originally only had 2.9GB available, so I moved some 1.3 GB off to external backup drive, leaving with 4.something, which was plenty.  

The problems, swapping/paging, slowdown, started happening as it was importing mail from Panther Mail.app to Tiger Mail.app, (I had a LOT -- will need to clean that up), and as it was indexing for Spotlight.  I got a warning that I was getting low on space, took a look and I had like 230 MB available !!!  Holy lost sectors, BatMan !!  So moved off more stuff to the external and it is happier now.  Don't know what is the available space right now, it was 2am when it was done, and I didn't look, and I am not home now.

But bottom line, there was over a gig available beyond what it said it needed for the install and during import of mail messages and indexing spotlight it went down to 230 MB, so my guess is that is where it went.  

Mail **is** a heck of a lot faster now, and that spotlight indexing information has to go somewhere.

This is on a G4 Cube, 450MHz, 832MB RAM, 80 GB Seagate B'cuda V, BTO ATI Radeon 32MB.
