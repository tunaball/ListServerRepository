Wayne,

Well personally the three things on the client side that sold me were:

1. iChat's expanded feature set. I have several clients who are 
already saving money with the 4 way video conferencing option.

2. Spotlight. Allows clients to search drives quickly for data that 
might not be otherwise easily found.

3. Automator (AppleScript on steriods). Which lets some of my clients 
easily automate workflows without getting bogged down with 
AppleScript coding.

On the Server side:

1. ACL's which let you fine tune who gets access to what.

2. Software Update server. Which saves bandwidth because you only 
download the update once rather than once per machine.

3. iChat server.

I think those updates outweigh the work involved in the transition 
from Panther to Tiger (I prefer the erase and install route - which 
requires backup but is a lot smoother in the long run) and having to 
wait for some products to release &quot;Tiger ready&quot; versions.
