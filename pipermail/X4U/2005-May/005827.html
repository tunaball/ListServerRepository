<PRE>I had this same kind of thing happen with x.3.8, x.3.9 fixed it.  Put  
a CD in, it never mounts or spins up.  On the previous problem there  
never was a fix and it wouldn't recognize any discs.  I found out  
that if I put the Tiger DVD in the drive, then rebooted, it would  
recognize and mount that disk, but if I eject it, it won't recognize  
there is a disc in the drive again.  It doesn't work with any CDs  
though and thats the only DVD I have so far.  Occasionally, if I  
booted with the Tiger DVD in the drive, after trying a CD and  
failing, I could put the Tiger DVD back in and it would recognize it  
and spin up/mount.  Not every time though.

This is on a Pismo, 400mhz with 512MB and a 60GB hard drive that has  
otherwise worked great since I got it in December.  I was trying to  
get a Lombard setup for the mrs, so I had the Lombard drive in my  
Pismo to load Tiger on it, but I couldn't load anything else.  This  
drive swapping thing did work though, to install Tiger on the Lombard  
BTW.

Anyone else had any problems like this?
