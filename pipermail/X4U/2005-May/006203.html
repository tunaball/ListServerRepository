<PRE>John Boccio said:

&gt;<i>I have a LaCie 200 GB firewire drive that has gone kaput.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It just clicks for a while as it tries to mount and then asks to
</I>&gt;<i>be initialized.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It cannot be seen by Diskwarrior or Data Rescue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I need to get about 100 GB of data .WAV files off of this disk, if  
</I>&gt;<i>possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Any recommendations about people who do disk recovery.
</I>

Data recovery services usually open your failed hard drive under clean 
room conditions, take out the platter, and put it into a device that can 
read it.  It really isn't hard for them to recover your data, but they 
sure do charge a lot of money to do so.  Usually in the thousands of 
dollars range.

Drive Savers is the best known of the drive recovery companies that 
specialize in the Macintosh, but they are far from the least expensive.
<A HREF="http://www.drivesavers.com/">http://www.drivesavers.com/</A>

I do know of a reasonably priced hard drive data recovery service.  Vogon 
International has created an &quot;end user program&quot; so that regular users 
have access to data recovery at better rates than businesses would be 
charged.

The program is called AuthenTec. It is only for individuals, or very 
small home businesses. 

There are 4 conditions to meet to take advantage of this program.

1. One drive per recovery.
2. The Disk can't have been taken anywhere else, or the mechanism opened.
3. Windows or Mac only. (No linux.)
4. It has to be an individual or very small home business.

They have a two stage recovery program. Recovery using the consumer 
AuthenTec process is what they jokingly call &quot;The slow boat to China&quot; 
program.  (It isn't fast, but it is less expensive than their ordinary 
service and other services.)

Stage 1 is free, and is the Diagnosis. You will be quoted a price to 
recover your data, it can take up to 1 week for diagnosis. Since you are 
getting a &quot;best efforts&quot; and a &quot;when we can fit it in&quot; recovery, you 
won't get overnight service, but if you need that, you can pay the full 
price.

Stage 2 is after you accept their quote. When you get their quote, which 
is usually between $350 and $700 dollars, depending on the complexity of 
the recovery, you can accept it, or have them send your disk back to you 
untouched. if you accept their quote, it will take about a week, worst 
case 2 weeks, to get your disk recovered. So most recoveries will take 
between 2 weeks to 3 weeks to get your data back. 

The good news is that, at this price, the same Vogon engineers 
that do professional recovery for large corporations work on your drive, 
using the same clean rooms, etc., it is just that they don't do the 
recovery on a priority basis.
