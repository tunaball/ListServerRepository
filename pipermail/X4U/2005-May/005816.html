Oh, I'm sorry... it was I who completely missed it.
Basically, you're asking: &quot;apart from Dashboard Widgets, what other 
files types might Safari be erroneously considering safe to open?&quot;

I think was your use of &quot;malware widgets ... in 10.3.9&quot; which confused 
me - in any case, the answer is &quot;none that I know of&quot;. It seems to be 
the case that security vulnerabilities are often the result of more 
factors which seem unrelated, and which render the vulnerability 
non-obvious when viewed outside of the larger context.

In this case the problem is the result that the Safari developers 
consider Dashboard Widgets to be safe, but the Dashboard developers 
decided that they should be run with only a single click. Thus you 
could get in the situation where a website installs a widget and you 
click on it in Dashboard to see what it does, only to have your browser 
hi-jacked. This is very much compounded by the fact that Dashboard 
widgets are non-intuitive to uninstall.

If you discount the application-bundle-masquerading-as-an-MP3 trojan, 
then I can't think of anything in 10.3 which behaves this way.
Personally, I think that could have been exploited much further, and 
that it displays a similar level of required user interaction to many 
Windows trojans (which I deal with on a daily basis), but experts 
disagree with me 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.sophos.com/virusinfo/articles/macmp3.html">http://www.sophos.com/virusinfo/articles/macmp3.html</A>&gt;.

But it's also my opinion that the authors of malware &amp; viruses often 
posses a deal of imagination &amp; ingenuity, and have a knack for 
perceiving these flaws in the relationships between interacting 
programs that security experts might envy. I don't think Mac users are 
likely to become aware of what proportion of security issues are 
inherent in target systems relative to those that are largely social 
engineering (read as &quot;stupid users&quot;, but remember that we're all stupid 
sometimes) unless the Mac gains a considerably larger market share or 
becomes otherwise more interesting to malware authors.

Stroller.
