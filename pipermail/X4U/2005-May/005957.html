I know its a personal preference, but I have to say it seems weird to 
me. Its like saying the iPod and iTunes are two parts of a whole, while 
I see them as two completely separate entities that work well together, 
as well as working well with other apps and devices. Maybe iTunes 
should be renamed iPodWare.

Bottom line is I would never have thought to go to iTunes to sync my 
Address Book or my calendars.

&gt;<i> They've basically seperated the control logic for the various sync 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff to be connected to applications.  It does make some sense..
</I>
I'd say its more accurate to say they've linked the control logic for 
any given device to a single piece of software. So if I want to sync my 
Address Book, I don't use the Address Book app, I use the app 
associated with the device I'm using (iTunes for iPod, .Mac for .mac). 
And therein lies part of the problem IMO. If I want to sync my Address 
Book, there are at least two different places for me to look.  BTW, 
what app handles syncing to a cell phone (I still haven't been able to 
load Tiger, so I can't look yet)?

Its really just a different way of grouping functions, it just seems a 
lot less intuitive to me.
