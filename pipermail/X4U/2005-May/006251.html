<PRE>Rad,

If you go to the Activity Monitor in the Utilities folder you might be 
able to see what processes are running hot when you're not doing anything.

Try cancelling processes until the network activity (light) drops off. 
Pick on apps that use the network first. If you eventually cancel 
something you shouldn't have a restart will get you back to square-1.

Coj

You can pop open the Network Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Network 
Utility) and use the Netstat portion (or just use the netstat command 
in Terminal).  That will tell you what computers you are currently 
connected to and what ports they are connected to.  Once you find the 
port, you can look it up (in /etc/services or at a ports database on- 
line) and see what application/protocol is being used.

To really see some of the traffic, I'd use tcpdump.  However, it's 
not terribly &quot;user-friendly&quot; if you are used to GUI-based apps.

Do you have your OS X firewall turned on, to prevent unwanted traffic?
