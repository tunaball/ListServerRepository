        I just checked to see if this idea is correct.  It is not for  
my setup, but it gave me another idea.

        I had just downloaded my mail a few minutes before reading  
this.  I connected up again and checked webmail to see if message  
were still on the server.  They were not.

         However, Stroller's idea led me to figure out something  
else.  Mail downloads all messages first.  Then it goes back right  
away and deletes from the server the messages it has just  
downloaded.  If it gets interrupted for any reason, it does not  
delete what's on the server.  Next time Mail goes to the server, it  
deletes only what it downloads in that session, not anything else.   
If anything gets missed, Mail seems to have no way to go back and  
delete it.

     Every time Mail has failed to delete message from my server, it  
has always been when it was interrupted for some reason.

     It could be that something is interrupting Mail on your  
machine.  It could be that the connection is being shut down too  
quickly.  It could be something within Mail itself.  It could be  
something weird about your ISP that makes Mail think the connection  
closed.

     Next time you download mail, open up the Mail activity viewer  
window.  Watch after the download to see if it says that it is  
deleting messages.
