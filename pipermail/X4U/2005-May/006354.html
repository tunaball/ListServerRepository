<PRE>That depends.... I've moved many OS9 users over to new Macs and simply 
dragged their Files/Folders over (including the OS). As a practice I would 
keep the partition names the same as before but the operators would often 
still have to re-create aliases and their Quark files would most often 
need their links re-established. I think most often their Launcher items 
wouldn't work (which are no more than aliases).

This has lead me to believe that perhaps more than just the file path 
(name structure) is being used with either aliases or Quark links.

Why it works some times and not others I don't know... perhaps it also has 
something to do with the OS9 hidden file &quot;Rename and Move&quot; or whatever 
it's called. If a folder is moved it is recorded in this hidden file. 
That's why, when you move a folder (within the same partition), Quark can 
still find the links. You have to move images out into a completely 
different folder for the links to be broken.

Anyway, I'm rambling... as usual... so I'll leave it there.

&gt;<i> -  I know that simply dragging the entire system to a different 
</I>partition
&gt;<i> could screw up the alias relationships ... Right?
</I>
Wrong.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Q: -  is it true that if I did drag the entire system 9.22 to a 
</I>different
&gt;<i> partition - and then named that partition exactly like the old partition
</I>&gt;<i> name ( and changed the old one to something else) -   Would this 
</I>preserve
&gt;<i> the system alias relationships?
</I>
Not required.
