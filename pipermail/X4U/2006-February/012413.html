<PRE>Here's the link at version tracker:

What's new in this version:
When entering transactions in the register, Quicken sometimes  
performed slowly on systems running Mac OS X 10.2 and 10.3. This  
issue has been resolved.
Stability improvements were made to prevent Quicken from quitting  
unexpectedly when editing a payee name (while the split is displayed)  
after editing the category and amount for a split line.
Stability improvements were made to prevent Quicken from quitting  
unexpectedly when launching or during data file conversion on systems  
running Mac OS X 10.4 or later.
Stability improvements were made to prevent Quicken from quitting  
unexpectedly when launching with certain internal files corrupted.  
The files in question are now repaired if necessary and Quicken  
launches as expected.
When canceling a Quicken Bill Pay payment, the payment would be  
incorrectly marked as a sent payment in the register. Quicken now  
correctly marks the cancelled payment.
When using Quicken Bill Pay, rules concerning postdated payments were  
sometimes evaluated incorrectly. This issue has been resolved.
When downloading transactions the Accept All button would become  
inactive after using the Accept button. This issue has been resolved.
After enabling an online account the Download Transactions window did  
not refresh properly. This issue has been resolved.
Quicken sometimes quit unexpectedly when creating a Smart Payee after  
deleting an online-enabled account. This issue has been resolved.
When selecting a downloaded transaction in the Download Transactions  
window, Quicken sometimes failed to copy the transaction to the  
register section of the window. This issue has been resolved.
In some cases investment transactions would reappear in the Download  
Transactions window after being accepted or deleted. This issue has  
been resolved.
In some cases the split ratio for downloaded stock split transactions  
could be reversed (i.e. 1 for 2 instead of 2 for 1). This issue has  
been resolved.
Quicken incorrectly displayed split transaction information for  
investment &#8220;Buy&#8221; and &#8220;Move Shares In&#8221; transactions under certain  
circumstances. This issue has been resolved.
Quicken now prevents disabling online functionality for an investment  
account if there are unprocessed transactions in the Download  
Transactions window.
When using the Scheduled Updates tab of the One Step Update window,  
clicking the weekday buttons rendered the buttons unreadable. This  
issue has been resolved.
When running a scheduled update, Quicken sometimes created and copied  
a backup file to .Mac when the Back Up to .Mac feature was enabled.  
This has been corrected so the backup is no longer created in this  
situation.
When using the Move Transactions window, some buttons overlapped  
register fields. This issue has been resolved.
You can now paste into the Number field of checking registers.
The File &gt; Open Recent menu item did not display a submenu when there  
were no recent files to display. This issue has been resolved.
The Help menu now includes a link to the Quicken for Mac user forums.
Stability improvements were made to prevent Quicken from quitting  
unexpectedly when deleting a transaction from the Calendar.
The Add Note feature of the Calendar did not work properly for some  
customers. This issue has been resolved.
When entering transactions from the Calendar, some buttons overlapped  
register fields. This issue has been resolved.
You can now delete multiple transactions at the same time from within  
the Calendar.
The Export Report to Excel functionality has been improved for better  
compatibility with Microsoft Excel.
When exporting a QIF file, the custom export options for Securities  
and Security Prices were reversed. This issue has been resolved.
Stability improvements were made to prevent Quicken from quitting  
unexpectedly when saving a copy of the data file. This issue has been  
resolved.
The &#8220;Margin Interest&#8221; investment transaction type did not work  
properly for some customers. This issue has been resolved.
When displaying security detail graphs, a notation has been added to  
indicate when a stock split occurred.
Tax rates used in the Tax Planner have been updated.
Quicken has been updated to check with a new server for information  
about the availability of software updates.
