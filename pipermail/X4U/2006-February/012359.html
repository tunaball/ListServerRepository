Everytime a synopsis like yours impels me to read a Dvorak article I  
end up feeling dirty and used.
His naff opinion columns are ALWAYS fireless &quot;smoke&quot; - hot air, in  
actual fact - for the reason that they're intended to be.

Dvorak is a professional troll; did you not notice when reading the  
&quot;article&quot; that there's more advertising than content on that page?  
This is how Dvorak makes his money - he is very good at making his  
writing both inflammatory and superficially credible, thus fuelling  
gossip and pagehits. It's very easy to see this pattern in Dvorak's  
stories, but in order to do that you have to read several of them  
first, thus improving his marketability to advertisers. Meanwhile  
discussion of his speculations promotes him and his site; pagehits  
result in a cycle which is either virtuous or vicious, depending on  
whether you have shares in pcmag.com or whether your internet life  
has been interrupted by his trolling.

I want to pick up on _just one_ point in his article, and will leave  
you to do analyse the others should you have the time, inclination  
and experience at Dvorak-trolling to do so. &quot;Bigger companies than  
Apple have dropped their proprietary OSs in favor of Windows&#8212;think  
IBM and OS/2&quot;, he says. Yeah, right, mate. Think too SGI &amp; Irix.

Whenever I read some of Dvorak's tosh I feel like I've wasted several  
minutes of my life which could have been FAR more productively spent  
darning socks. And now I've wasted MORE time responding to it! And  
I've promoted his site in doing so, adding momentum to the cycle I  
mentioned above. See??!? I feel dirty and used!! ARRRRG!!!

Reading Dvorak is the internet-equivalent of watching Celebrity Big  
Brother on TV.

Stroller.
