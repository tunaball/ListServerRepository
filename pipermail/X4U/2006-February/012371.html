<PRE>Help ?

I ran iSync to sync up my address book and iCal with .mac  yesterday.
It appeared to lock up.. was running for a VERY long time.  I think  
at some point I tried to cancel it.
I went into the .Mac preferences to check what I had checked.  ical,  
addressbook was selected and ran it again. and it appeared to run  
just fine.
I remember checking my iCal app and all appointments were still listed.

But I went to add something to the Address Book today, and it's empty !

Anyone have any suggestions ?    and NOOO  I don't have a &quot;backup&quot;  
handy.

I believe my computer at work and another computer at home although  
not exactly &quot;current&quot; is pretty current and most &quot;new&quot; contacts are  
on my iSync capable phone as well. (my phone does not however have  
ALL contacts, just a subset.

I'm hoping to use my computer at work to retrieve ALL information..    
I think it still has everything. unless I ran iSync at work yesterday  
as well.. can't really remember.

just wondering if anyone has any suggestions as to 1.  what went  
wrong ?   and 2.  does MacOSX keep some back up copy handy for just  
such an emergency ??

Yes I should of had a back up handy.
