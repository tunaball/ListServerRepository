<PRE>On the original basic question of how safe is it to leave a Mac on 
24/7, I can provide anecdotal evidence.

I bought a Mac 7300 when they were new, thus Feb of 1997.

It ran as a desktop for a year, and then graduated to being a mail 
server and software router for a network for another six or seven 
years. So that was a total of 7 or 8 years of running 24/7 without 
any hardware problems.

We have an eMac that has been running 24/7 since they were new.

And my mini runs 24/7 except when powered down to haul it from 
part-time mediator private SOHO to Church part-time job. So it 
restarts twice a day, having been powered down in between of course 
for about twenty minutes, on each of 4 days each week. Other than 
travel time, it has been running 24/7 since they were new. It has had 
one hard drive replacement under warranty. It is paired with a 
MicroNet back-up drive that has been running whenever the mini is at 
the SOHO, but shuts itself down when the mini is aware. The MicroNet 
drive was defective on arrival and replaced, but has been going 
strong since.

Peace,
Ted
