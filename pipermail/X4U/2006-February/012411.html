I am a little surprised, but found Linda's explanation to be most 
informative, and should have considered the fact that many would have 
both.

There is also a lot to be said for comfort, familiarity and 
ease-of-use.  I know someone that does a lot of graphics work on one 
of the Charcoal Firewire iBooks under Mac OS 9.  I've actually been 
recommending they hold off upgrading and going straight to an Intel 
based Mac.  It's worth remembering that the step from Mac OS 9 to Mac 
OS X is expensive both in the terms of the learning curve, and in the 
terms of the new software that is needed.  At this point, I really 
feel that anyone still on Mac OS 9 should take a careful look and 
decide if they can hold off on upgrading till the move to the Intel 
Architecture is complete.

For that matter, I occasionally use my PowerBook 540c running System 
7.1 to do some work, the main reason I keep it around is I 
occasionally need a 68k-based Mac with a floppy drive.  It's a very 
strange requirement in this day and age, but the point is that 
sometimes people have an actual need for old hardware and software. 
Another example is that I've still not resolved a problem keeping me 
on Mac OS X 10.3.9.  I've also got one graphics application I 
regularly use that will make moving to Intel difficult for me, unless 
I can get it running on an emulator that emulates classic Mac's, as 
the app is over 10 years old.
