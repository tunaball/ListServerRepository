<PRE>Hi all.  I have a G3 iMac (333 MHz, running Mac OS X 10.3.9) whose  
display failed.  I removed the processor / drive bay unit and the  
power supply board and found that it would not boot up without also  
attaching the display boards.  (In fact, the power on / sleep LED is  
also connected through the display board.)  I have two questions to  
ask the group.

First, I have been able to power the units up on the desktop (with no  
case or display) and I can network to it, I can mount the drives on  
my remote Desktop (G5 iMac running Mac OS X 10.4.5) and I can also  
SSH into the machine.  What I would like to do is get something like  
Share My Desktop to run and configure it to accept a connection from  
the G5 iMac using a VNC Client.  I do not know enough about the  
command line to do this.  I have transferred the application and even  
started it running, but it won't accept the connection from a VNC  
client on the remote G5 iMac.  Is there a better way to do this  
Without connecting a display to the G3 iMac?  (I do not have any  
display to use.)  My goal is to be able to run the machine remotely  
via the G5 iMac display, keyboard and mouse.  (I do have a keyboard  
and mouse on the G3 iMac, if that helps.)

Second, I would like to eliminate the need to keep the display boards  
connected.  Does anyone know what signals need to be spoofed?  I.e.,  
which pins need to be jumpered?  I would like to ultimately have only  
the processor board / drive bay unit, the power supply board and the  
power on switch and LED (plus the speakers &amp; microphone, perhaps, but  
they are no problem).

Alternatively, does anyone need any of these working components?   
This project has no obvious long term practical motivation.  I also  
have the complete housing, with all of its parts (blueberry?).

I am on digest, so copying my e-mail address &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x4u.html">shindell at mac.com</A>&gt; would  
be very helpful.  Thanks!
</PRE>
