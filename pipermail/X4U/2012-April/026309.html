&gt;<i> While I have no doubt that Flashback is real, and that it is a good idea to do all that you can to protect yourself from it, I'm beginning to think that much of this scare was hype invented by anti-virus software firms in Russia, from whom the original report eminated.
</I>
And you'd be wrong.

&gt;<i> Some research on the Web turns up reports that the &quot;600,000 infected machines&quot; written about may not have necessarily been Macs.
</I>
And that &quot;research&quot; is likely wrong.

&gt;<i> The problem is that when there is a panic about a new virus, there will always be a few folks who aren&#8217;t deep thinkers who will rush to tell you that they have been infected
</I>
And there are many people who *are* &quot;deep thinkers&quot; who do think about these things and have reported seeing the trojan in the wild.

&gt;<i> Also, the media has reported that &#8220;security experts&#8221; have confirmed that Flashback is a huge threat. There is a problem with consulting with security experts. I call it the &#8220;to a hammer, everything looks like a nail&#8221; problem. These are folks who have been trained to recognize the millions of viruses that exist for Windows.
</I>
Except for the Macintosh Security experts I spoke to.

&gt;<i> To them, everything in the entire world is a huge security threat. I've never heard of a security expert who has said: &quot; Just relax; start worrying if and when there are verifiable reports of computers being infected.&quot;
</I>
Just because you've never heard of them, doesn't mean they are not out there. I interviewed one on Friday about exactly this issue:
&lt;<A HREF="http://yourmaclifeshow.com/inthenews/2012/04/06/interview-rich-mogull-discussing-flashback-trojan">http://yourmaclifeshow.com/inthenews/2012/04/06/interview-rich-mogull-discussing-flashback-trojan</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> I wouldn't be surprised if, after all is said and done, that not a single one of us will be infected by Flashback, and not a single one of us will know anyone first-hand who has been infected by it.
</I>
Wrong again.

&gt;<i> Macworld now has an article about Flashback:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.macworld.com/article/1166254/what_you_need_to_know_about_the_flashback_trojan.html">http://www.macworld.com/article/1166254/what_you_need_to_know_about_the_flashback_trojan.html</A>&gt;
</I>
Didn't you just say, &quot;There is a problem with consulting with security experts.&quot; The guy who wrote that article, and who I interviewed, is the foremost Mac Security expert in the community.

&gt;<i> I hope that you find this message useful.
</I>
Not particularly.
