<PRE>Shawn, why don't you just present an opposing point of view and back it up, instead of getting all snarky!  You guys disagree, fine, ask your questions and present your evidence, ask him to do the same. You come off as less than &quot;followable&quot; by your presentation.

Just my 2&#231;.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While I have no doubt that Flashback is real, and that it is a good idea to do all that you can to protect yourself from it, I'm beginning to think that much of this scare was hype invented by anti-virus software firms in Russia, from whom the original report eminated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And you'd be wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some research on the Web turns up reports that the &quot;600,000 infected machines&quot; written about may not have necessarily been Macs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And that &quot;research&quot; is likely wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is that when there is a panic about a new virus, there will always be a few folks who aren&#8217;t deep thinkers who will rush to tell you that they have been infected
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And there are many people who *are* &quot;deep thinkers&quot; who do think about these things and have reported seeing the trojan in the wild.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, the media has reported that &#8220;security experts&#8221; have confirmed that Flashback is a huge threat. There is a problem with consulting with security experts. I call it the &#8220;to a hammer, everything looks like a nail&#8221; problem. These are folks who have been trained to recognize the millions of viruses that exist for Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Except for the Macintosh Security experts I spoke to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To them, everything in the entire world is a huge security threat. I've never heard of a security expert who has said: &quot; Just relax; start worrying if and when there are verifiable reports of computers being infected.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just because you've never heard of them, doesn't mean they are not out there. I interviewed one on Friday about exactly this issue:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://yourmaclifeshow.com/inthenews/2012/04/06/interview-rich-mogull-discussing-flashback-trojan">http://yourmaclifeshow.com/inthenews/2012/04/06/interview-rich-mogull-discussing-flashback-trojan</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wouldn't be surprised if, after all is said and done, that not a single one of us will be infected by Flashback, and not a single one of us will know anyone first-hand who has been infected by it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Macworld now has an article about Flashback:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.macworld.com/article/1166254/what_you_need_to_know_about_the_flashback_trojan.html">http://www.macworld.com/article/1166254/what_you_need_to_know_about_the_flashback_trojan.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Didn't you just say, &quot;There is a problem with consulting with security experts.&quot; The guy who wrote that article, and who I interviewed, is the foremost Mac Security expert in the community.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope that you find this message useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not particularly.
