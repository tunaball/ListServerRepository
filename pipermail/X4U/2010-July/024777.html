<PRE>Thanks for that, Nick.

You know, I've tried that a few times in the past and, even after the reboot, nothing would happen. Every time I wanted to check the volume it would warn me that Windows needed exclusive access to it and ask if I wanted to schedule it to scan after the next reboot - and so the cycle would continue until I gave up rebooting.

Just last night I discovered why it may have been so troublesome... Whenever I'd click on the volume to get properties on it a window for that volume would be open - and of course windows then thinks something on that volume is active. So, last night I got properties for the volume, closed all open windows for the volume and it finally scanned through. Before that I also ran a utility called CheckDisk (which took all night) so I'm not sure which one fixed my problem but this morning I was luckily able to see all my missing files again -yipee!!!!!

My IT guy at work also recommended using a FREE utility called Recuva - which I've used before and forgot about. He also recommended against using USB volumes when doing lots of heavy crunching type work. He said the Firewire drives were much more stable for long sustained data transfers. I knew FW was faster in the long run (slower burst but higher sustained transfer compared with USB) but I didn't know about its stability. This is the first USB only drive I've purchased. In the past I'd always go out of my way to buy FW400 or FW800 drives but I actually didn't think such a beast was available for the DW MyBook range - until just after I bought it... D'oh!

So, a happy ending, with the file recovery at least - this time...

Chrz,

Brett

</I>&gt;<i> Inside of XP, get properties on the volume, and then click on the Tools tab or something like that. Inside that you should be able to check the disk for errors. Also, check the 2 check boxes in the lower part of the window. It will probably want to reboot. Let it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I recently bought a 2GB WD My Book USB Raid drive to store my video files on from the set top box and video camera. I formatted it as a 1TB NTFS mirrored RAID so that it could be mounted on the set top box for file transfers &amp; streaming video off the drive, etc. I used iNTFS to enable Snow Leopard's ability to read/write to NTFS volumes and have happily been working with it on my Mac for a few weeks now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A couple of days ago, I began using MPEG Streamclip to convert a buncha video files down to iPhone size for viewing on the train, however, yesterday I noticed that the main folder of videos, it was doing the batch processing from, had become empty - all the video files in it just disappeared.... poof!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tried turning on invisibles and couldn't find the files anywhere on the volume. When I selected all files/folders and got Info it said the files selected totalled 129GB but when I get Info on the whole volume it shows over 300GB in use so it seems like my files are there somewhere but they can't be seen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tried mounting the USB drive on my MBPro running bootcamp (WinXP) but same thing there too - empty folder... even with showing hidden files. And again, in WinXP it says the volume is using over 300GB.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, now I'm hoping to find a utility (free if at all possible) to check the directory of this volume to see if it has become corrupted and hopefully fix it, or at least find a file recovery software to locate and copy the missing files off.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess if I can't fix the directory I'll have to pull everything off and reformat... I dunno if I have the space on my other volumes to safely store them while I scrape it down.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Your help is MOST appreciated!!!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
