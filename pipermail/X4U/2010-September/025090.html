<PRE>G'day all,

I found a little utility called iNTFS which is freeware and simply enables the built-in ability of 10.6 to WRITE, yes write to NTFS volumes. I think it's an AppleScript which very quickly enables/disables the NTFS write ability.

Apparently Apple haven't enabled it and are keeping it quiet because it's not fully working yet. I was using it for a few months and ended up paying for a commercial software called &quot;NTFS for Mac&quot; because the folder directory kept becoming corrupted where the contents would just disappear on me. I'd have to connect it to my WinXP boot partition and fix the volume before the contents would re-appear.

NTFS for Mac seems much more stable and it also provides a repair utility which works seamlessly inside Apple's Disk Utility.

If I was in a pinch I'd use iNTFS just to quickly copy something on and off NTFS volumes (of course on OS 10.6 only) but if working directly off the volume or more demanding drive requirements I won't trust it.

Cojcolds

ps. For some reason I couldn't get MacFuse working...

He brought me his portable USB hard drive from his Windows pc to me, but I got some kind of &quot;can't write to this volume&quot; error message when I tried to copy his videos to his drive.  I have no trouble reading the contents of his drive.  It has his iTunes music on it so he can take it with him to the bar where he DJs.  The drive had plenty of free space and I didn't use any kind of DRM on the video files.  Does anybody have any idea what is going on and what's the easiest way I can give him his videos?  I thought it would be easier to copy the files to his hard drive rather than burning a bunch of data DVDs.  Thanks.
