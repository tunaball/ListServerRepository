<PRE>Greetings
Same email address for 15 years, small company . Their not allowing   
my mail service unless  the POP 3 address and the SMTP sender is  
them. No different SMTP address is allowed . This is crazy as it cuts  
me off from my e-mail, I have always used different smtp senders.  
Luckily I am in a location for about 3 months. Unlucky,  there could  
not be a worse time in my life for email problems to happen. Now I  
can take my Pismo and use it to get my e-mail as I have dial up  
access to this ISP. Long Distance but only short  checks.

  I am currently using a G4 PPC 1.67 lap top. 2 gig memory  Plus a  
Pismo 500 1 gig memory,  Both lap tops  have 10.4.8 family pack,   
Both  using Mac Mail, set up to use my Airport extreme with modem and  
Ethernet cables and antenna port.

If I get  all the mail into the Pismo with a dial up connection every  
couple of hours and download all that mail into one Mac Mail account  
and one mail box, called say, the Pismo Mail IN.  Is there a way that  
I can then send or retrieve that mail from the Pismo into my G4 Mac  
Mail  account and all the G4 filters I have set up will work and see  
this as just as normal incoming mail and be filtered correctly into  
the G4 mail boxes.

  They both run  on my  airport. The Pismo will have to go dial up  
land line to retrieve the mail.   I could cut the land line once I  
did a mail check and go back on the Airport if that is easier for  
transfers. I get about 350 emails a day usually in one big slug at  
the end of the day . The mail systems on the G4 work most excellent .  
As does the Pismo. But I need the power and files on the G4 makes it  
the one to be sending a whole lot of stuff out.  I can put down the  
15 year old address outgoing on the G4 no problem just not receive  
mail on it from that address, they do not want their server to be  
used for mail only. Geez I am paying full price, $19.00,  what if I  
surfed for 10 hours, the usual time I am online a day. I figure it&#8217;s  
a deal for them.  I have never had a problem but they sold out to  
some bigger company.  I will have to switch, but not just now.

  I also have a .Mac account but I am on a slow DSL, so that is  
limited to an always have address and backup has been real  
funky.        Mail From the 10.4.8 Pismo to the 10.4.8 G4 and  
filtered as I have That account set up already.  Oh please something  
simple.

Thanks for any ideas or help on this.

Geoff
