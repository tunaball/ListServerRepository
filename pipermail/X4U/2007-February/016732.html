That was the whole point. I was providing a 
working printer with cartridges in it almost full 
plus an extra set of cartridges. I myself have 
taught kindergarten and fourth grade in the U.S., 
admittendly before the situatino in this country 
was as awful as it is now. The point is that YES, 
I thought an teacher would be grateful to have a 
few hundreds pages of printing offered free 
before the printer had to be disposed of because 
the district would/could not afford to replace 
the ink. I was offering hundreds of pages of 
printing for free.

&gt;<i>Using an inkjet on a regular basis is likely

</I>&gt;<i>especially considering the number of old HP 
</I>&gt;<i>Laserjets kicking around. HP specified their

</I>&gt;<i>you'll often find them being thrown out with 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;only&quot; half a million pages on the clock (you 
</I>&gt;<i>can determine the page count by printing a test 
</I>&gt;<i>page from one of the menus). These are therefore 
</I>&gt;<i>being disposed of with only about &quot;10 months 
</I>&gt;<i>use&quot; (at the specified duty cycle) and a 
</I>&gt;<i>cartridge, which you can pick up brand new on 
</I>&gt;<i>eBay for about &#163;20, will do 20,000 pages, IIRC.
</I>
What does that have to do with it? I had a 
printer primed to print hundreds of color pages 
for FREE. Then throw the unit away when it needed 
new ink.

&gt;<i>And yes, I was surprised to find that teachers 
</I>&gt;<i>around here are paying for supplies out of their 
</I>&gt;<i>own pockets. By the last month or half-term of 
</I>&gt;<i>the school year the photocopying budget in our 
</I>&gt;<i>town is exhausted and the only way teachers can 
</I>&gt;<i>provide printed hand-outs for the kids is to 
</I>&gt;<i>produce them at home. :(
</I>
Yes. It's been going on for years. When our 
daughter was in locals schools a decade ago, we 
were regular asked to send her to school with 
paper, pencils, colored pencils, protractor, 
scratch paper, regular pencil, pencl sharpener, 
and many other things. Plus there were fund 
raisers throughout the year. And this is is a 
rather high-middle-class neighborhood of San 
Diego.

So anyway, my printer.  Who care what 
replacements cost if someone is offering hundreds 
of  pages free and no requirement to renew when 
the printer runs out of ink?

They STILL are not allowed to accept the donation!?

And meanwhile as a parent I had been required to 
provide supplies worth pennies plus participate 
in fund-raising drives for minor supplies??!!
