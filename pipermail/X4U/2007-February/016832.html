<PRE>Hiya Linda,

Thanks for responding. I used to have a HP LaserJet 5MP which I was able 
to plug into the Airport (with bandaids and shoestrings to get it 
connected via USB) but it was DOG slow.

After we acquired the Brother my preliminary testing came up with no joy. 
Direct connection was the only way. I haven't tried it for a while but 
thought I'd ask here before wasting further time.

Unfortunately the two machines which share the printer are laptops so 
permanently sharing the printer off one machine is not practical and it 
would also require that the connected Mac always be running.

I'm looking for a solution where I can connect the Brother directly via 
the USB port in the Airport and have it visible to both laptops.

Cheers,

Coj

Is there a way to get my non-PostScript USB Brother HL-1240 laser printer 
to be shared through my Airport Extreme for wireless printing? 

Currently we plug it directly into the Mac which needs it at the time. 

Leave it plugged into one Mac, and on that Mac, under Sharing pane, check 
&quot;Printer sharing&quot; on. Other Macs on the network should see it under Shared 
Printers (turn the triangle) in their printer lists.

We do this here at home with hubby's photo inkjet, which isn't a 
postscript printer.

We also have both a PS HP and a non-PS HP laser hooked via Ethernet into 
our router, and all computers can hit those, too. If your Airport Extreme 
has a USB port, you should be able to plug your Brother into that in the 
same way, but it sounds from your note like you might have tried that and 
had no joy. Is that right?

peace,
Linda
