You would wish that a teacher print out an entire learning module and  
then dispose of the printer?
I do not know this particular model, but it is often the case that  
with many inkjets it's cheaper to replace the printer than to buy new  
cartridges!

Using an inkjet on a regular basis is likely just not cost-effective  
for a teacher, especially considering the number of old HP Laserjets  
kicking around. HP specified their workgroup models (such as the 4 &amp;  
5 and the 4000 series) at 65,000 pages per month IIRC, and you'll  
often find them being thrown out with &quot;only&quot; half a million pages on  
the clock (you can determine the page count by printing a test page  
from one of the menus). These are therefore being disposed of with  
only about &quot;10 months use&quot; (at the specified duty cycle) and a  
cartridge, which you can pick up brand new on eBay for about &#163;20,  
will do 20,000 pages, IIRC.

And yes, I was surprised to find that teachers around here are paying  
for supplies out of their own pockets. By the last month or half-term  
of the school year the photocopying budget in our town is exhausted  
and the only way teachers can provide printed hand-outs for the kids  
is to produce them at home. :(
