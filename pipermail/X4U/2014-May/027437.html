<PRE>I own a copy of Adobe Creative Suite Premium CS6, and I have Photoshop CC and Lightroom 5 via the Creative Cloud.  The only other tool I'll likely use via CC is InDesign, and then I'll probably just get it for a month or two at a time.   Though since last October I've really been too busy with my day job to work on my creative projects, so I've not been able to start work on a couple of photography books I want to work on in InDesign.

Realistically, even if I was to go for the full suite via CC, there wouldn't be that huge of an increase over what I was paying for CS Premium upgrades, and the monthly $50 payment would probably be easier to deal with than the big $750 (or whatever it was the last time).  My main problem is that Photoshop and Lightroom are the only apps that I see a need to upgrade every time, or nearly every time.  I could be a few versions behind with the other apps most of the time and be happy.  As a result I've felt quite stung due to having moved to CS Premium (prior to the original Creative Suite, I had individual copies of many of the tools).

Truth be told, I'm far more upset by Google's acquisition of the Nik Suite, and what they've done with it, than I am about Adobe CC.

&gt;<i> What do you all think about Adobe's move to sell their Creative Suite in the cloud? We are a small Mac shop in the newsprint publishing business, and we have 4 workstations and have been running CS3 on OS X 10.6 and 10.7 (I've also tested CS3 on a Mavericks machine at home and the stuff we need works fine). Photoshop and Acrobat Pro are the main Adobe programs we use. Multi-Ad Creator is what we use to build ads and paginate. Our business has grown to the point where we are going to need to add an additional workstation, possibly two. The old days of grabbing last version at a blowout price as everyone upgrades to the latest and greatest CS is over, as obviously Adobe has decided the Creative Cloud is where they want their business to be. Boxed copies of CS5 &amp; CS6 (heck even CS4) are at a premium, because they are like rare antiques now! LOL
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Long term I need to consider dumping Creator and switch to an all Adobe workflow for building ads and laying out pages. That would be a major hurdle, is that I and the rest of the designers know Creator extensively, using Illustrator a little to clean up camera ready ads that really aren't, and we use InDesign not at all, so there would be some retraining issues.
