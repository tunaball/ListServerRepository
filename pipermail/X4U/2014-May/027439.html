No doubt, you are absolutely correct. In fact, Photoshop is the only app in the universe that has any number of Photoshop-only features.  Having a print background, I resonate strongly with your point about CMYK/

However, for the many other workflows out there which are RGB-only, including some which have print as the destination, there are a handful of alternatives to Photoshop.

Pixelmator, IMO, by far and away is the #1 alternative for OS X. GIMP is another, and works on the 3 major platforms. Acorn has many fans, and there are probably a few more titles.

I would heartily encourage any Mac user to seriously investigate Pixelmator. It is an *extremely* capable raster editor, creative tool with many of the must-have features found in PS. The development team are aggressively updating and evolving the application, and even helping to re-define the lines between raster and vector. One of few developers who truly &quot;get&quot; the OS X power and experience. Plus, it's only $30. That's about a week's worth of lattes&#8230;you owe it to yourselves!!

I do not know why no other applications work in CMYK, unless it's that many of these alternatives are less than 10 years old, and whose developers have decided to pursue web/interactive as their target customers. After all, we are told, print is dead and the web is the future, despite all that stuff still being printed, perhaps off shore&#8230;who knows.

Freehand is the only other app I can even think of which was not Adobe (at one time) and which supported CMYK. I remember searching once for methods of taking RGB files to CMYK. There are some workflows involving colorsync, but I got the feeling that &quot;CMYK&quot; if not proprietary to Adobe, seems to be Adobe's game&#8230;

Weird, as CMYK existed before Adobe's founders were even born, but post-computer age, CMYK appears to be locked up by one company. Perhaps others can weigh in on this?

I'd certainly like to know more about this.
