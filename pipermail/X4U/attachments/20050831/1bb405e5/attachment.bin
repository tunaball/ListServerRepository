To the list:


here is what have done to get the video to play at least 50% of the
time...


I searched my hard drive and trashed everything associated with Media
Player.


I then restarted and reloaded version 9.


I then launched version 9 and minimized it.


Then I launched the CNN video I wanted to see, and lo and behold...
saw it!


I cannot guarantee that what I did will wrok for you, and I have no
idea if it will work tomorrow, but………


Oh, BTW, some suggested I just turn on CNN.


I live in Turkey, and CNN is not here. Hurricane Katrina really did a
number on the Gulf area, and I have friends there. Trying to get a
handle on the damge, as I am unable to contact them by phone. I hope
they are well. Time will tell...

news videos

</bold>

To the list,


I cannot seem to view the various news feeds from CNN and other
stations that require the windows media player 9.0


Now, I am running a mac, 10.3.9, have player 9.0, and all software is
up to date. I have a dsl connection.


I have tried viewing the video both with the player not active, as
well as active.


Safari is java enabled.


is there something else I have to do to view the videos?


Thanks in advance!


Lee
