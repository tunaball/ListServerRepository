Terry,


An hour or so later I decided to read the Help and see if there was a
solution.  I was told to copy the folder where I had copied the
content of that folder.  Maybe there was an invisible file I don't
know, but after I copied the whole folder I got everything.  Then at 2
AM it was time to go to sleep.

One malfunction tough.  The front Firewire connector crashes
sometimes.  I connect an HD to it and after a while I get the message
that removing that HD might damage it.  It's incorrect removed.  I
don't do anything.  The Mac does it for me.  I now use the connectors
on the back of the screen.

Copy the files from ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook to the
same location on your new machine
