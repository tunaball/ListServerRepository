<<Do you have any plugins installed in Safari?  If so, this was well
documented, and updated plugins for most are available.

Thanks Neil, missed the one about the plug-ins.  Found the
"<fixed>AcidSearch.bundle", but have not removed it. Will do the
10.3.9 upgrade on Sun.


Thanks again to all for the help.
