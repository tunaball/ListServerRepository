I used to sew before I got involved in painting and computers.  My
suggestion is that she go for a lesser model ($500-$800) to see if she
"really does" want to take it up again.  Then she could sell it and go
for the other model.  My sister sews a lot, and she spent less than
$500 for hers.  It would be sad to spend that much and then find out
she couldn't get full use of it.  Maybe even an estate sale, or used
higher end model would work out.

discuss

what can be done with an attached personal computer, but the software

apparently is Windows-only, the Husqvarna company ships the  

software on 3.5

inch floppies, AND uses a hardware dongle for license verification.  

Does

anyone know whether this is beyond the ken of Virtual PC and a USB  

floppy

drive?

I know that some USB hardware dongles will work with VPC, but you'd  

be better off contacting the manufacturer first before making that  

kind of investment...
