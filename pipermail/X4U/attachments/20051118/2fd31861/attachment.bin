John and all,


wav files work! Mp3 files do not!


aiff files also work, and can use itunes to convert mp3 files to
aiff...


Cannot get any of those sound files to show up in the "Sound" portion
of the System Pref file so cannot use them as a system sound...


Thanks to all for your help.

Lee

I tried to find where the "base" sounds (Sosumi and al..) are filed
and could not. I searched by name, and even searched for invisible
files.


No luck


Can someone help me please?

Try dumping your sound in ~/Library/Sounds

If you don't have a Sounds folder simply create one. I don't know if
an mp3 or wav file would work but .aiff does.


Those "base" sounds reside in Macintosh HD/System/Library/Sounds by
the way. Don't put your sound in here. Keep it in your users folder.
