Can you elaborate on this? My Mac meets Apple's published requirements
for running Tiger, but doesn't have a DVD reader. Does this mean I
could get CDs to install it from?

From the Apple Store website:


<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param><smaller>Tiger ships on a DVD,
but if your Mac doesn’t have a built-in DVD-ROM player, you’ll need CD
media. When you buy Mac OS X Tiger, you qualify to purchase Tiger CDs
for only $9.95.

There's a PDF form that you need to download and fill out. It requires
you to send in the install DVD and and $9.95 and they will ship you
back the install CDs.
