Kodak.com & Snapfish.com.  I prefer the quality of Kodak, I can tell a
difference.

I've enjoyed using iPhoto to order prints and posters from Apple's  

print service.


I also use ezprints.com for uploading images to have like t-shirts  

and Coffee Mugs printed up etc..


does anyone know of any alternative sites or services or macosx  

application.  that works with any other service... that provided both  

prints and novelty items like coffee mugs and t-shirts etc..  ?
