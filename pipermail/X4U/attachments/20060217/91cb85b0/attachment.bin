Thank you Stroller, I for one appreciate your time and comments!

<excerpt><fixed>Whenever I read some of Dvorak's tosh I feel like I've
wasted several  

minutes of my life which could have been FAR more productively spent  

darning socks. And now I've wasted MORE time responding to it! And  

I've promoted his site in doing so, adding momentum to the cycle I  

mentioned above. See??!? I feel dirty and used!! ARRRRG!!!


Reading Dvorak is the internet-equivalent of watching Celebrity Big  

Brother on TV.
