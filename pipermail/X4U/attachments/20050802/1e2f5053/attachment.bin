I hope this isn't too simplistic; I am still using Mail 1.2.5(v553). 
Opened the <underline>Sent</underline> file and clicked on the "TO"
tab at the top, thus alphabetizing all the messages.  Selected 12
messages and dragged them to the mailbox I created for them.  The "TO"
heading switched to my name because now it reads "From", but it works
and all the messages are in the separate mailbox and have retained the
proper subject line, date, and time.

Hello:

	Unfortunately, Mail does not have "outgoing" filters, it only filters 

"incoming" mail.  The best way to do it that I have found, and what is 

recommended in the Help file, is to set yourself as a BCC on all 

outgoing messages, and filter them when they come back in.  A copy
will 

still remain in the Sent box, but your incoming copy will be sent to
the 

mailbox of your choice.


	I feel the same way, and it is something that I consider "basic",
which 

is very much missing; along with multiple boolean expressions in
filters 

(i.e. all messages that come from X OR from Y, AND have subject Z.)


	dZ.

<excerpt>Hi Folks,


Can anyone help me with a mail filtering question. I run Mail 2.02 on  

10.4.2. I have filters set up for all my mails. For incoming mails 
they 

work like a dream, but for outgoing mails, they do not. I have  tried 

both setting up an additional filter criteria such as if > from  

contains > John > filter to mailbox John, + if > to contains John >  

filter to John. But my outgoing mails still all sit in the "Sent" 
folder.


Alternatively I have set up a separate mail box, i.e. Joe In and Joe  

Out, as a child of the former and then set the filter rule to > if to 
> 

contains > John > then move message to > John Out. But the mails 
still 

sits in the Sent box.


This has been my only complaint about Mail which I have used ever 
since 

OS X came out. Previously I used Eudora.

I feel I am missing something simple and would appreciate any help.


Thanks,


Roy
