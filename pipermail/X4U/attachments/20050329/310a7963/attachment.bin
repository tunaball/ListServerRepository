<color><param>0076,0053,0251</param>Kewl, something I can answer!  If
you put a space in front of the first word of the file, it will
automatically go to the top of the list in the folder.  You can do
this with several, but it will maintain a numerical or alphabetical
order.</color>

<excerpt><excerpt>If I had a folder2 inside of folder1


-  And I set the display = view as list

-  Then I click the triangle to expose the contents of folder2

-  I do not know how to do the following: - to grab a file from

folder2 and

move it UP A LEVEL inside folder1... Does anyone know how to do this?


-  Currently - the only way I know how to do it is to open folder2 as a

separate window - and then I am able to drag the file as I please -

however this is more cumbersome than I had hoped.  Any ideas?
