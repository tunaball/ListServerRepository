Hi folks, hope someone here can help me.


A friend has a G3 iMac and uses imSafe to back up, but it has recently
started misbehaving. Specifically, it allows her to select a folder to
back-up, but when she goes to select a destination, the programme
crashes. She called me, and I tried all the usuals, including dumping
preference files, cleaning caches etc., to no avail. I then installed
Deja Vu preference pane, and to my surprise I had exactly the same
result, with a crash on selecting the second folder (regardless of
whether I selected the Target or Destination folder first.) My
curiosity aroused, I downloaded PsyncX and had exactly the same
result. 


However with Silverkeeper and iBackup I had no problems, but neither
of these apps are up to what she requires in terms of automation etc.,
and especially with no back-up sets.


I created anew user and tried all of the above... and guess what: No
problem whatsoever.


So, unless I miss my guess, something in the User Folder is causing
these guys to crash on selecting the second folder, but I've no clue
what. Any ideas?


Thanks in advance...
