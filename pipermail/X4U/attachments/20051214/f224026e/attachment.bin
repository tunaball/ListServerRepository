I hope someone is up tonight.  I installed Tiger on my G-3 iBook.  At
first I got only Dawin kernel panic.

Then I installed again, and used Archive and install.  That worked,
and now I <underline>can not get the Password to work</underline>.  I
have used the install CD to repair all permissions twice (also did
that before install).  Have tried admin password, .mac password, key
chain password, vault password, and even LapCop password.  Nothing
works.  Also reset Root password with the CD.  It still won't let me
in.  All my info is still there--checking Disk utility on the install
CD.

	I am on digest, so if you can email me directly I'll be your friend
for life.
