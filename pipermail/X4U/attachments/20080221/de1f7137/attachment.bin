<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>OK..well that is a pretty
useful tidbit...I must confess that I did not know that about Aperture.


I wonder if Matt is near an Apple store? Around the time I was
deciding to get Final Cut Pro, I was in my local Apple Store, where
they had scads of Macs loaded up with a nice variety of Apple software
titles, including FCP. Now, Aperture was not a shipping product back
then, but it is now, and I would think that it'd be part of the
software complement featured on floor models of computers at Apple
Stores these days..


So, maybe the best thing for him to do would be to skate in and try
his important apps on actual shipping Macs in the Apple Store. IIRC,
they even allow customers to install software they use but which isn't
on the in-store computers; those computers are set to re-set
themselves in the wee wee hours, so that anything installed on them or
created on them is wiped; the computer reverts to the install it was
set up with. He might want to phone first, though..just to make sure
it's cool.

<excerpt><fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>In his original post
Matt made this requirement for Aperture performance: "when
straightening a photo I'm willing to slow down and be more deliberate,
but not willing to lose track of when the computer has caught up to my
input". Therefore he needs to look at GPU before he looks at CPU.</fontfamily></excerpt>
