I also had the same experience about the change in iDisk' size. After
checking the .Mac home page, I found the following message.

Mail and iDisk combined storage space for full membership has been
increased to 250 MB. Default settings are 125 MB of mail storage and
125 MB of iDisk space, and you can designate the storage to fit the
way you use your .Mac account.

do with the increase in the size of iDisk's storage.

<excerpt>Yesterday my iBook started doing something strange. A little
dialog box appears

saying "iDisk size doesn't match the size of your computer's iDisk,
you won't

be able to use your iDisk till this is fixed." When I click ok my iDisk

unmounts from the desktop and then remounts. And starts working as
always then

about 30 mins later it does the same thing. Anyone else have this
problem ever?
