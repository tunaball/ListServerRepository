<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>one more thing to tack on, I
want to heartily second Eugene's suggestion to look at Apple's refurb
units...


it's actually the first place I go when considering new
Macs..excellent value, that machine has been QC'd twice, and qualifies
for apple care.


a very good idea to consider seriously...
