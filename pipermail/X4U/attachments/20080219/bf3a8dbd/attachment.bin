<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>I have had outstanding luck
with a pair of G4 Mac minis, each with 1-gig sticks. they're the
1.42Ghz models, with Superdrives and Airport, and were the best Mini
available at the time.


Now, I have endured some degree of ridicule because I use these little
guys for doing massive 3D rendering, for editing video using Final Cut
Studio and for doing all manner of photoshop, iTunes ripping/playback,
2-D design and illustration, etc.


But I am here to tell you that those little machines cut timber.


Not as fast as the new intel minis or more powerful Macs, but more
than enough  to handle movie-playing, itunes chores and the other
things you describe. A new intel mini with 1 gig of ram is about $600.
Add an external Firewire 7200 rpm drive as your boot volume for that
machine, and you have a very capable unit which is small, quiet and
which will put a smaller dent in your wallet than other new macs and
some used ones will.


I assume you have a monitor...


just my 2 beans
