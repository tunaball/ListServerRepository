<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>Hi, Cindy;


I also have a Pismo which I use wirelessly and have had pretty good
luck with the D-link DWL-122, which I got in the neighborhood of $50
or $60 back in 2003.


It works fine with one exception: when you are finished with your
wireless session and want to unplug the DWL-122, you have to either
shut down or restart the Mac and unplug it before it finishes
rebooting. Otherwise, you'll get a Kernel panic, which will force you
to power down or restart anyway.


I did a little poking around online for a solution to this problem,
and there seemed to be none, so, it's something I live with.


HTH,

<excerpt><fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>My granddaughter has
my Mac Pismo Powerbook. It doesn't have an airport card. She wishes to
connect wirelessly to the family's Linksy WRT43G Wireless-G 54 Mbps
Broadband Router. Would one of the Wireless USB USBCV Tools work with
this computer? If not what do you suggest.

Thank you,  Cindy Moore
