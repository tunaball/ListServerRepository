Could it be that your firewire drive needs a firmware update?

<excerpt>hi all,

i have a problem with my PPC 9600/OS 9.1 and two firewire hds
connected to it, that is,

i can't copy files to and from the two firewire and the internal hds,
i mean can transfer 

small files of say 4 kb like aliases but when i try to pass larger
ones the copy window 

stuck and freezes the mac which i have to restart; i can copy files
through the internal hds 

with no problem and the strange thing is that the same error comes
also when i try to transfer 

files from one firewire hd to the second and vice-versa. i thought
<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>the culprit was the firewire 

card so i tried with another card of another brand but the issue is
still there. 

when i bought the first firewire hd, which i didn't reformatted or
initialise, it worked fine 

till remained the last 20gb disk space; then i bought a second one of
another brand

thinking there was something wrong with the first but unfortunately
the problem remains.

i also reinstalled a fresh OS 9.1 with no help.
