<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>Nanc </fontfamily>thanks for
ur replay,

i'll check for the <fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>firewire
drives firmware update, but could it be that both

the two drives need a firmware update?


Ted thanks for ur replay,

i hope both the firewire LaCie Porsche 250 and the SQP 160 have the
Oxford

chip set, btw your hypothesis that the two drives could send and
demand data 

too fast for the card to handle seems to be a good one for me, but
what can be

done as a workaround for this issue? is there any software around that
can slower

the firewire drives data transfer?


Chris thanks for ur replay,

4 of the internal hds are connected to an Adaptec 3940UW and i thought
it could be

something wrong with it, but the fact that the transfer fails also
with the 5th drive

connected to the mac internal scsi chain makes me think different
about it.


i have a G4 connected to the 9600 through ethernet and i also tried
this operation

from here with the result that both mac freezes. btw i can freely pass
files

to and from all of the 9600 drives to the G4 hds.</fontfamily>
