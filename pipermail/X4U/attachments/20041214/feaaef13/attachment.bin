to access from the Mac on a server or are

they trying to access the C drive of a particular machine? Are they

Windows 2003 server? Pre Win 2003 servers are accessible from OSX but
2003

or higher are not without specialized software.

Richard, et all;

	This is the third time I've tried to reply to this post.  My previous
two tries have not shown up in  the archives as yet, so I'm trying
again.

	They're trying to access a windows 2000 server serving multible
directories.  I think I just need to get the correct SMB syntax to
include the username and password in the url call; should it be in the
form of "smb://Serverename/Directoryname:username:password" ?
