Any suggestions?


How far back do you have to go to find a Mac that can read a DD disk?
I have an old 180c powerbook at my parents' house somewhere.

</bigger></bigger>Reader ....  has a stash of old floppies that
contain fonts from Adobe, Agfa, and other companies. It's bad enough
that the fonts are stored on this prehistoric media, but said media is
of the 800KB variety. He wonders what course to take. <bigger><bigger>


</bigger></bigger>I'm afraid that the answer is to find an old Mac (an
SE on up to a beige Power Mac G3 will do the trick), insert the
floppies into that Mac's drive, create disk images of the floppies,
and then copy the images to the current Mac. Third-party USB floppy
drives support 1.4MB HD floppies but not double-density 800KB disks. <bigger><bigger>
