I know I already asked this question recently.   

with more information about Tiger coming out, I was hoping maybe
someone might know the answer to this.

I was able read this tidbit on Apple's website about their VPN

</smaller></fontfamily></bold><fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param><smaller>Automatically
establish a VPN connection when a firewall protected service is used
for specific domains.

<bold>VPN Settings

</bold>Enjoy new VPN options: stay connected to a VPN server when
switching user accounts or logging out, and direct all network traffic
through the VPN connection.



</smaller></fontfamily>It says "new VPN options"    just wondering if
anyone could tell me what those new options are ?  what different
means of connecting will it have compared to their old VPN client ?
