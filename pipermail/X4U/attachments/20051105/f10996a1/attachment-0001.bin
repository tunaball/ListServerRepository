</color>Control-Spacebar shortcut for Opening Itunes

</bold>

Dear list,


when I hit "control key" and the spacebar together, Itunes launches.
(Running system 10.3.9.)


Where to I go to turn off this "feature." It is not listed in Keyboard
shortcuts menu and a search of the help guides did not turn up a thing!


Hints?


Thanks!


Lee
