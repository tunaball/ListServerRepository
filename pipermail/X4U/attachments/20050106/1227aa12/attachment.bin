<bold>OS X + telephone systems


</bold>Does anyone have a recommendation for telephone system(s) that
OS X will work with?

We are a small office of ten people  all on OS X and our current
telephone system supports six telephone lines. We are planning to
expand ( more users and more lines) and add voice mail. All the
telephone systems that we are familiar with; seem limited to offering
additional features(such as recording the time spent on a call and
having the computer dial the number for the user or displaying the
caller's name and number) in Microsoft  Windows format only.
