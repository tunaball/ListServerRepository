<excerpt>I found a way to put the dock at the top from Mac OS X Hints
for Jaguar (chapter 3) by Rob Griffiths, edited by David Pogue, I did
a google search "OS X dock at top" and got the whole chapter! You use
terminal:


1. Open Terminal.


This program is in your
Applications<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>¡÷</fontfamily>Utilities
folder.


2. At the % prompt, type this: defaults write com.apple.Dock
orientation top (and

then press Enter).


See page 5 for an explanation. In this case, you¡¦ve just issued the
magic command

that puts the Dock at the top of the screen.


3. Quit Terminal. Then, to make your change take effect, quit the Dock.

With OnyX from Titanium Software at <<http://www.titanium.free.fr/>
you can move the Dock around at will without going through the above.
