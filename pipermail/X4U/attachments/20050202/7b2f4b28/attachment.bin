that the growing number of iPods on Microsoft's main campus: "To the
growing frustration and annoyance of Microsoft's management, Apple
Computer's iPod is wildly popular among Microsoft's workers. 'About 80
percent of Microsoft employees who have a portable music player have
an iPod,' said one source, a high-level manager who asked to remain
anonymous. 'It's pretty staggering.' The source estimated 80 percent
of Microsoft employees have a music player -- that translates to
16,000 iPod users among the 25,000 who work at or near Microsoft's
corporate campus. So popular is the iPod, executives are increasingly
sending out memos frowning on its use."</fontfamily>
