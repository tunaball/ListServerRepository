<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>I personally have no "great
hard drive" stories...


Had a Lacie which puked after about a year or two...started acting
wierd and made ill-sounding noises which no Utility or reformatting
cured.


Just went thru a bunch of Western Digital "My Books."  Two of them
started acting up within a week of purchase, and a 3rd was dead out of
the box...wouldn't even power up.  I have 2 other My Books; one serves
as a boot volume for a mac mini and seems OK; the 4th is for storage,
and I'm not 100% sure it's ok...less than 1 month old. Thank goodness
they're from Costco, so I don't have to get saddled with some
expensive doorstops.


I have 2 Seagate Free Plays or whatever they're called. Seem ok as
drives, but they *insist* on going to sleep as I'm working (but if
I've done nothing for 5, 10 minutes), but that seems to be a "benefit"
which the HD industry wants us to have far more than just a simple,
basic, fast, reliable drive that is <bold>just</bold> a drive and
doesn't think or squirt out eye candy.


This is kind of a rant, but, I don't need "smart" hard drives to
decide when I want them to sleep, I don't need Drives which can do
backing up, and I don't need a hard drive to have an armada of lights
like you'd see in the helm of the Starship Enterprise.


Hey, HD  Industry:  how about you nix the fancy lights and "smartness"
and just deliver reliability and performance??


good gravy!

<excerpt><fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>I'm curious if anyone
has any comments about the reliability of external HD's, especially
the Lacie, and Western Digital models.  I really need a couple
external drives for photo vaults, and am trying to decide if I should
buy something, or build something.
