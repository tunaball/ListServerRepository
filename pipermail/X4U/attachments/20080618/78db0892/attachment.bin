Very cool...I like the sound of that.

Between 1st-Gen and 2nd-Gen G5 iMac, are there any caveats? Sometimes
the first-gen comes with some nasty bug, worked out by the time the
2nd-Gen is released...


sometimes not...

Disconnect everything, lay screen down, loosen (but don't try to
remove!) 3 screws, remove back cover and stand as one piece. Observe
all components in plain sight!


The later iSight equipped models are much harder to disassemble and
reassemble, never mind accessing the drives. Only the RAM is easy on
those machines!

terms of Hard drive replacement as well? or, does the RAM just happen
to be located internally near where the iSight camera pokes thru?
