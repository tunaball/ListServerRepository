Greetings,


Anyone know how in Tiger to turn on the "Require password to wake...."
permanently via System Administrator perhaps?


In Panther it was possible to login as root and go to
"./System/Library/Frameworks/Screensaver.framework/Versions/A/Resources/EngineDefaults.plist
" and change the askForPassword to the value 1 (via TextEdit).  This
would make any user put in a password to stop the screensaver and wake
the computer.  We would set the screen save to 5 minutes for security.


Also, any idea how to permanently turn off Bluetooth and access to it?  


Thanks in advance.
