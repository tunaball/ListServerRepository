 I can't get Windows Sharing working properly (first time I try).

<excerpt>

The checkbox for "Windows Sharing" in Sharing is checked, and there's
a Public folder in the Home of user foo. There's a label when you
select Windows Sharing that says that the computer will be accessible
to Windows users as \\computer.name\foo. The firewall is off in all
the services.


Nevertheless, when we try that address from the XP of a coworker
(computers connected through the company's LAN) an authentication
dialog shows up and I can't even log in with the very user foo. Is the
expected usage not to have an authentication dialog at all?


Searching the web I founded screenshots of Jaguar with a checkbox
"Allow this user to log in from Windows" in the user profile panel,
but I can't find it in Panther.


Anyone got it working? Any hint?

</excerpt><fontfamily><param>Helvetica</param>Since our server is pure
wintel operating system, I had to configure my network prefs to suit
the server demands. What we did was simply feeding the server name and
login password into my shared folder in our server. From system prefs
and network should be found required fields to be filled with windowz
information. 

Now on those shared resources are in my dock, where pointing those
they get the authentication automatically from my keyring. Works very
fluently and seemless with our network at the headoffice. Connection
is tcp-ip cable.
