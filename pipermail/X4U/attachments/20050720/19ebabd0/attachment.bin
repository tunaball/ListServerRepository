I experienced this sometime ago - but have only come across it once.

  A quick google turned up this page:

 From what it says here, I wouldn't worry about it, but would perhaps

follow the advice if it were to happen enough to be annoying.

Good luck!

there is an option to "Always Check for World Leaks"

I imagine you have this enabled.

night when coming back to check my G3 iMac for email, there was a

Safari message box on the screen saying that I had a "world leak" and

that I should report it to Apple.  iMac is on DSL through D-Link

wireless router.  I check Sherlock AppleCare and Apple Support and can

get no hits on the query.  This sounds very ominous; what's up with

this?
