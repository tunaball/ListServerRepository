http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/ would be the usual place. Look under

I have one of these drives, and although I haven't tested it
extensively it seems to work. I have it in an external firewire case,
and after a recent 10.3.x update it started to play DVDs. If I open
iDVD without it plugged in I get an alert saying "Your Macintosh does
not have a supported superdrive", but not when the Pioneer is
connected.


I bought this drive on the basis that previous Pioneers were
recognised as "Apple shipped / supported" (indeed mine now shows up
that way in System Profiler) and it is firmly my belief that a Mac
will mistake it for a factory-installed SuperDrive.


Stroller.
