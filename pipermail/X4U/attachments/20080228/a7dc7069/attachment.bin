<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>Would it be possible, when
launching a new thread to actually compose a fresh, brand-new email
with it's own Subject line and addressed to the group, rather than
replying to an ongoing thread?


the main reason for starting your <bold>own</bold> thread is
functional; people who organize by threads like to have all the
same-subject mail in a thread, without having others muxed into it..


Sorry if I sound harsh; I don't intend to, but let's use the power of
the great OS X to keep mail threads separate.


thank you!
