Is there any way to remove a "half" CD from my CD drive? It's the kind
that looks like two sides of the CD have been sliced off. I foolishly
inserted one into the slot of my G3 iMac.  It doesn't show up and will
not eject.  Do I need a repairman now?  I tried the paper clip thing,
and the restart holding down the eject key.  Nothing.  Thanks for your
input!
