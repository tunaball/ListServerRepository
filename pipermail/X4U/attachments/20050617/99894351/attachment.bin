I have been reading all the posts about wireless hacking with
interest, having just set up a D-Link wireless router on my iMac
ethernet so that I can use my iBook elsewhere in the house.  


Most of what is posted is over my head, but I keep reading, knowing
that some will sink in or make sense.  How is it that Smith Micro and
others advertise the WiFi finder?  Are these free and non password
protected?  When in NY a few days last month, I turned on Airport and
had a choice of about three wireless connections, none of which were
hosted by the hotel I was in.  All I did was click and connect.  When
I was in Florida in April, someone in my daughter's neighborhood had a
Linksky which I was able to connect to as well.  I did set up a
password on my D-Link, but the iBook doesn't seem to need it when I
open and turn on Airport.  Does this mean anyone can connect to my
wireless?  


When driving through Sacramento, there are various wireless networks
showing on Airport, but all seem to need a password.  Is it worth
while to buy a WiFi finder?
