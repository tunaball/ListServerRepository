I have a couple of new friends Tom Karns and Mac McIlvan--thanks guys. 
After resetting password on the install disc, I had to put "root" in
for the name, and that finally worked.  I have set up separate user to
log in and will set up a new administrator account.

Thank you,

Vicki


<excerpt><fixed>I hope someone is up tonight.  I installed Tiger on my
G-3 iBook.  At 

first I got only Dawin kernel panic.

Then I installed again, and used Archive and install.  That worked,
and 

now I can not get the Password to work.  I have used the install CD to 

repair all permissions twice (also did that before install).  Have 

tried admin password, .mac password, key chain password, vault 

password, and even LapCop password.  Nothing works.  Also reset Root 

password with the CD.  It still won't let me in.  All my info is still 

there--checking Disk utility on the install CD.

	I am on digest, so if you can email me directly I'll be your friend 

for life.
