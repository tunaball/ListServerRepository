 I was 'forced' to upgrade to 10.4.3 and since then the fans on the G5 
GHz dual have been coming on much more often. I seem to remember this 
being discussed a while back and a solution suggested. Could someone 
remind me what the 'solution' was.

Unplug the machine for a couple minutes.


Set processor to Automatic in Energy Saver Preferences

actually you should set to "highest" to prevent the runaway fan issue.

Applejack. Fans would not shut off.


Solution was to shutdown and then unplug the machine for 15 or 20
minutes; worked like a charm.


If that doesn't work, try resetting the PRAM (holod down Option key+
apple key+P+R at start up and wait for three or more bongs) or the
NVRAM (option+apple key+O+F at start-up; release the keys when you see
writing on the screen and

wait for the writing to stop loading, then type each of the following
(press Return at the end of each line):

reset-nvram

set-defaults

reset-all

Then hit Return to reboot the computer will boot.
