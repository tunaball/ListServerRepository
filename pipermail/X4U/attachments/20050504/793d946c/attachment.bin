OK, don't laugh too much...


Has anyone tried Tiger with Classic; imparticularly Adobe Pagemaker
6.5 or 7.0 - does it work AND does it work well?


I have to tell you, I just got Tiger in the mail and am scared to
death to load it - most of my files are Pagemaker, and I don't want to
be forced (yet) into converting them to InDesign.


If anyone is using Tiger with Classic Pagemaker, have there been any
problems at all?


As usual - THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!
