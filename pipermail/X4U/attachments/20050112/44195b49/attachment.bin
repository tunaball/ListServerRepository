You got me there.  I didn't ask my question clearly at all.  What I
meant to ask was whether or not a portion of the space can be used for
data storage, while a portion of it can be used for mp3s.


Thanks for the info though:)

I have been putting off purchasing a flash drive, waiting for a good
deal...but can't wait much longer.  I already have an iPod...but if
the iPod Shuffle can serve the purpose of a flash drive, and offer the
