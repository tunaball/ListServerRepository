Mail 1.3.11

OSX 10.3.9


Any idea why a Mail account would display this message when clicking
back to it after checking another account?


"<italic>The message from Brandi Armstead
<<brandi@corporateexpressions.cc> concerning “[Fwd: FW: YOUNG~ CRG
Office BC Proof]” has not been downloaded from the server. You need to
take this account online in order to download it."


</italic>This happens frequently.

Our DSL is always on, connected, working fine, etc...


I'll read messages in our Work Mail account, switch over to check mail
in another account, & when I go back to the Work account, I get a
variation of the above error message, referencing whichever message I
click on. (and -every- message I click on!) None of 'em are readable!


I can go back to the other account, (& several others, actually!) &
all still works fine, but when I go back to the Work account, it's
unusable!!


I have to Restart Mail to access the Work account again!


I think it's font related, but can't pinpoint anything. Sometimes it
works fine, sometimes not... 

(I'm in printing & use SuitCase to activate fonts all day, but rarely
mess w/ System fonts!)

I rarely have time to troubleshoot - production environment, y'know -
I just quit & restart Mail a dozen times a day!


Any ideas?

Thanks..

Tim
