who has big problems with QT for windows, and wondered if anyone here
could suggest how he could get it straightened out.


below is part of a chat conversation about the issue.


thanks for any tips!

FRIEND you check all the files it should associate with it but it
doesn't do it and plays mp3 on a website when you tell it specifically
not to @$#%@# do it

ME so, it doesn't play the media you want it to?

FRIEND it plays stuff i don't want it to even though in the options i
put no no no to every file type

ME right, so yer problem is where it comes to QT playing what you want

FRIEND- yeah like when i click a link with an mp3 qt starts up when i
told it not to

FRIEND- so i have to copy link location to winamp instead</bigger></fontfamily>
