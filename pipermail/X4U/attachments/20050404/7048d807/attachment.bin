Let me apologize first off for this non X post but I'm not sure who
else to ask.


I'm trying to get a USB card to work on my G3 Powerbook (WallStreet)
under OS 9.1. According to the manufacturer's web site (card's at
home, I don't remember their name) I have to make sure the USB support
extensions are in installed in the System Folder. They provide a link
to Apple's download page for USB Adapter Card Support. On the download
page it states that the installer will place the following files in
the extensions folder.


<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>	▪ 	USB Support

	▪ 	USB Device Extension

	▪ 	USB Software Locator (requires Mac OS 9)

	▪ 	HID Library

	▪ 	Serial ShimLib

	▪ 	USB Mass Storage Support

	▪ 	USB Mass Storage Extension


But it also includes this warning.


<bold>Important</bold>: Mac OS versions 9.1 and later include a later
version of this software. Installing USB Adapter Card Support 1.4.1
over Mac OS 9.1, 9.2 or later could result in the USB adapter card not
working.


I have OS 9.1 installed but from the above list I can only find HID
Library and Serial ShimLib in my extensions folder. Are the other
files missing or does OS 9.1 have them incorporated somehow within the
OS and no longer require the extensions? I'm not sure if I should try
the installer or not.


Suggestions?</fontfamily>
