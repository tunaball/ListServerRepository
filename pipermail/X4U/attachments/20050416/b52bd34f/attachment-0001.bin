<excerpt>A friend of mine, took a working iSight, and tried hooking it

says the green light on the iSight comes on, indicating it has power.
But when they go into iChat, all the video options are grayed out.
Acts as though there is no iSight connected.    Any suggestions ?

Don't the eMacs come with a G4 ?
