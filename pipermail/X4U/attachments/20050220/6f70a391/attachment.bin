<excerpt>I've seen Apple talking about running the new PowerBooks in

older ones in that regard? I have a 15" 1.25 GHz from 1 year ago and
I'm trying to figure out if I can safely run it in lid closed mode
without overheating.

A simple search of the AppleCare knowledge base for "powerbook lid
closed" will return
