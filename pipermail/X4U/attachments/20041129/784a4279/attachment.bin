This might be the third time I've a Firewire problem.  On a G3 I had
to buy a card, and for a G4 it was under warranty.

<excerpt>One malfunction tough.  The front Firewire connector crashes
sometimes. 

  I connect an HD to it and after a while I get the message that 

removing that HD might damage it.  It's incorrect removed.  I don't do 

anything.  The Mac does it for me.

Paul,


I'm no expert in the area, but it sounds to me like a hardware issue,
that the port is losing contact with the disk. I wonder if there's
something loose in there? (How's that for hi-tech talk!)
