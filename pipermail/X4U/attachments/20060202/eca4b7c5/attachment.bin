It is a long thread but insightful.


It states a problem with iTunes 6.0.2.

I had the same problem and put the old iTunes "pkgs" in a folder I
created, "Removed Receipts."

Once I had only one iTunes pkg in Receipts I could run the Disk
Utility Repair Permissions.


Good Luck

<excerpt>Hi all,


Dual 1 GHz G4 Quicksilver running 10.3.9.


I've been having lot's of computer delays lately (spinning beach
balls) so I decided to run Disk Utility to see if it would help. When
I run Repair Permission it gets about a third of the way through then
I get the following message...


Disk Utility internal error

Disk Utility has lost its connection with the Disk Management Tool and
cannot continue. Please quit and relaunch Disk Utility.


I've quit DU as well as restart the computer. I even tried booting
with Command-S and doing a "fsck -fy" which said the disk was OK. But
I keep getting the same message. Anyone have any suggestions?
