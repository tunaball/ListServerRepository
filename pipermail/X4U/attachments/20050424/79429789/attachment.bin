<color><param>0000,0000,0000</param>Since you have 10.3.8 on the
external drive you have a few relatively easy options. 

1. If possible boot from the 10.3.8 drive and run the updater again
choosing that drive as the one to install to

2. Use a program such as Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the drive you
have already updated to the external firewire drive.

Question, now that 10.3.9 is out, is there a way to update my external

firewire drive w/o reformatting it ? I currently have 10.3.8 on the

firewire drive.

Firewire drive - LaCie external 120 GB (400 speed)
