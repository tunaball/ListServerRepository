I've been using Skype to talk to my brother-in-law in the Netherlands
with a lot of success.  However, my wife is quite phobic when it comes
to new technologies.  I have seen adapters that connect a "plain
telephone" to a USB cord, which then allows you to pick up a handset
and make a call as usual, but of course, of the many products out
there, none appear to be specifically Mac-compatible.


For example:


http://www.pcphoneline.com/skype    and click on the

Skype Gateway</x-tad-bigger></color><x-tad-bigger>"</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily></bold>


Has anyone used a solution out there that they know works with OSX? 
Something inexpensive? ;-)  I like the idea of a USB connection rather
than one of those ethernet phone boxes.

downloading Skype and then figure out a "time to call schedule".

The latest version adds itself to your Startup Items so you're able to

see if your contacts have their computers on. I've only played with it

using the mike and speakers in my AlBook12 -- not the best way, but it

works okay in a pinch.
