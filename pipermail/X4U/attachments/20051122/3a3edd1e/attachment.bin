Stroller and the list,


It turns out that I neither mp3 nor wav show up.


So, imported the sound into ITunes and then exported it as an aiff
file.


Still did not work.


Went and downloaded "aacConverter" and converted the wav file to a
"aif" file.


Dumped that into the sounds folder and that worked!


Thanks for the help, and the hints!


Lee

Adding a sound...

All the .aiff files in ~/Library/Sounds/ show up in System Sounds for
me. Maybe you should reboot?


Stroller.

aiff files also work, and can use itunes to convert mp3 files to
aiff...


Cannot get any of those sound files to show up in the "Sound" portion
of the System Pref file so cannot use them as a system sound...

Try dumping your sound in ~/Library/Sounds

If you don't have a Sounds folder simply create one. I don't know if
an mp3 or wav file would work but .aiff does.
