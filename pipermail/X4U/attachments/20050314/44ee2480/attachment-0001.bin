Hello Gurus

 

one of my macs...

an iMac G4 with a screen on a stick..

is doing something unusual..

 

it is running

OSX 10.2.8

 

and apparently decided sometime on thursday

not to allow me to drag icons on my desktop anymore..

actually I can't drag any icons anywhere..

makes copying files from disks...

and placing my icons in fun positions..

and dragging stuff to the trash impossible..

 

the mouse works....its an apple optical..

 

everything else..the doc...etc the superdrive..

you name it...it works..

just can't move files by dragging and dropping

can make aliases....copy and paste...

 

can't click and drag...well I can click...and it hilights

the icon...just can't move them or do anything with them

can click on files where they are and open them...

menus work....even volume lever drags up and down...

 

so I don't think its the optical mouse..

 

did I or someone inadvertantly lock icons or something?

 

any ideas.?
