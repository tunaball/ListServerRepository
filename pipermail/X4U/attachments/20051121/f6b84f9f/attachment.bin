I recently had this same problem on my G3 iMac, and received good
advice here.  Nothing worked, and it now is holding the mini
CD<underline> and</underline> a full size CD with double stick
tape--we tried everything.  Neither are "recognized." Not being able
to find a reasonably priced replacement, I found an external CD RW for
$2.99 on ebay with a firewire connection and will use that until one
can be found and replaced internally.  My old G3 has limited value, so
didn't want to spend a bunch to replace it right now.  The external
drive works very well, a bit noisy, but at least it works.

<excerpt>Unfortunately, the *G5* iMac doesn't have a bezel that flips
open.   

It's slot-loading.

Even though the old iMac DV's were slot loading, they still had a a  

hunk of plastic covering and forming the opening, and an eject hole.  

The trick is being able to see in there and find it (two paperclips  

to hold things open and a kid holding a flashlight).


I've never seen an optical drive without a manual eject hole. Doesn't  

mean they don't exist, I've just never seen (or heard) of one.
