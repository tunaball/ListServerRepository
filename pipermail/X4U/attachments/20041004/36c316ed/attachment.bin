Actually the tech note says that :

by damaged or incompatible software or, more rarely, damaged or
incompatible hardware."

Though a kernel panic can be caused by a software problem, it is much 

more often caused by a hardware problem. Usually bad RAM (usually
third 

party RAM) or a bad USB hub or USB device.


Have you installed more RAM, or added a USB peripheral, recently? 
Remove 

them and see if things clear up.
