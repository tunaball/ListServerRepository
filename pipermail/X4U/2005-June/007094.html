Security isn't something that most users are aware of, until it's 
pointed out to them (as Mr Wieber's neighbours have done - others have 
pointed out that less conscientious kids may download movies &amp; warez on 
open networks). Security issues are just easy to resolve on wireless 
networks, if you know how, and as long as you're running a decent o/s.

For most of my customers rewiring is not an easy option. I live in a 
planned town, in which most of the houses are less than 20 years old, 
and many of my customers live homes which are kept spotlessly (dare I 
say, soullessly?) tidy. Ethernet wiring is not installed in even our 
current mass-produced homes (which nowadays I find strange, to be 
honest), and for the likes of my mother wired ethernet would require 
replastering the walls and perhaps wallpapering. Ethernet cable 
skirting the door-frames would not be considered &quot;acceptable&quot; - since 
many ISPs advertising internet connections for multiple computers only 
support a single model of router, they usually support a wireless model 
for this reason.

Older homes around here often have tatty telephone extension cables 
tacked to the wall, but those were all done a few years ago, before 
DECT cordless phones became cheap, or for the benefit of a dial-up 
modem for the computer in the spare room.
