The PowerPC had an emulator so that all 68k apps worked reasonably  
well without any re-compiling.

However, apps that were eventually re-compiled did run faster. So, if  
Apple did switch CPU's I'm betting that this would be the same path.  
All existing software would run fine on the new CPU, but newer re- 
compiled software would run faster.

And more speculation here, all exisiting software, if it is written  
in Cocoa may not even need recompiling as it is supposed to be pretty  
'portable' as long as the underlying software knew what to do with  
the API calls coming from the software.  And this is pure  
speculation, as I am no programmer.

But, it's definitely too soon to tell, as all this is just conjecture  
on a rumor.
