Think of it as plumbing. It you want to get a lot of water from A to 
B, you need a wide pipe. A bit of microbore (1/4&quot;) pipe in line with 
a 2&quot; pipe gives microbore flow. Mac Mini is microbore in line with 
1.5&quot;, G5 Mac is 1.75&quot; in line with 2&quot;. (Just a rough idea, don't put 
figures to this). The computer example is different because a CPU 
doesn't need a constant supply of data to do useful work whereas the 
plumbing does.

All a 64bit CPU has over a 32bit one is a wider address bus, and in 
some cases a wider data bus.

A wider address bus means that the memory address space is bigger. 32 
-&gt; 64 = vastly bigger. If you're running a large Oracle database you 
can hit the 4GB limit of a 32bit CPU. This happened years ago on 
Sun/HP/IBM and they went to 64bits. If Apple is going to go after 
this market, it has to use 64bit CPUs.

A wider data bus means that more bytes can be transferred into/out of 
the CPU at once. This does increase speed if the data is in a form 
where this is useful. Usually these bytes are going to/from a disc 
which is a serial device at the read/write head level and is much 
slower and so getting more bytes in/out of the CPU doesn't help. For 
fast source/dest devices it can help if all the bytes are needed. If 
the device can only handle 8/16/32 bytes at once, it still takes 
8/4/2 shots to get all 64 bits there.

When Sun went 64 bit, a lot of their users thought it was faster - 
until they timed it.
