<PRE>I've gotta ask... do your clients know of your benevolence with their 
networks???

What about the personal risk of giving someone easy access to your IP 
packets while you're internet banking or using your credit card for a 
purchase?

Do you back up your computer's data? I'm sure you do. Why? Because you and 
I know it's too late to wish you had after your drive is dead. Similarly, 
it's too late to wish you had &quot;closed off&quot; your network after you find a 
huge sum of money has arrived on your credit card - that you can't account 
for.

As for others using (or mooching off) your internet connection, I know my 
mum has a download threshold and then her bandwidth is severely choked for 
the rest of the month. She wouldn't bee too thrilled to find out that it's 
because of a neighbour she keeps exceeding her limit and dramatically 
slowing down.

And what if they are downloading a huge file on your network, that's gotta 
slow you down anyway, right? You paid for a specific bandwidth and you're 
not getting what you paid for.

But if your clients clearly know that you are leaving their networks open 
and they know the risks, then there's no argument from us, is there?

.....

Having an open network is not illegal but should in 
fact be done so that society will more quickly have a high quality 
wireless mesh network throughout our communities. Else, we have no 
need for libraries or parks. Everyone should buy their own books and 
mow their own lawns and build their own basketball courts.
