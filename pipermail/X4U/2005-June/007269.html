<PRE>Michael Elliott asks if there are free alternatives to
the popular iChat/AIM site, chatfinder.com, and there
are a few.  There are free alternatives to just about
everything depending on what inconvenience or risk
you're willing to tolerate.  I joined when it was
still ichatfinder.com but it changed to chatfinder
when AIM became compatible with iChat in 2004. 
Chatfinder.com is a fascinating window into the
internet chat world that is not driven by porn, sex,
or greed.

Let's say your local Apple Store guy talked you into
buying an iSight camera.  Once you hook it up and
marvel at your own image, you realize that you don't
know anyone else who uses iChat or AIM.  Ooops!  Now
what?  

When iChat AV was first introduced there were at least
a dozen sites where you could pick up a screen-name or
two and try it out.  Unfortunately, &quot;video-chat&quot; for
some people, cloaked in the anonymity of the internet,
means adult entertainment and that is what you found
on most of them - trench coat guys.  Let's face it,
without income no one can operate a free service for
very long.  Most bombed quicly. Here's the shakeout
two years after the iChat AV intro...

www.myisight.com is the only other iChat screen-name
&quot;directory&quot; besides chatfinder.  It is untended and is
a collection of the refuse of the internet - some
truly &quot;unusual&quot; people.  It will take adding at leat
50-60 names to your buddy list before you find someone
online but it is free and functional if your personal
time and your self image are both worthless. Ages 13 +
and your best chance to chat with an undercover law
enforcement official. 

ichatters.com is a collection of chatrooms, adult and
non-adult, but there are adult lurkers in the
non-adult rooms. Email confirmation is required to
join.  Surprise!- guess why it's free?  The owner also
runs porn sites so you may see a a lot of adult spam
for the rest of your life unless you use a throwaway
email address. At last count, he's collected 25,000
email addresses at a lower cost than buying lists. 
Note the glaring omissions in the privacy policy.  If
any site asks you to download a &quot;little program&quot; to
make the site work better - don't!  If your just
clowning around or you're broke and want to chat with
others who are down on their luck, this site is an
option.  Ages 18+

chatfinder.com is a searchable directory with real
time member online status, a list of everyone who
looked at your profile, and about 50 other chat
features including live technical help with iChat.  It
is professionally managed - that means that most of
the creeps have been waved off to myisight.com or
ichatters.  You won't find &quot;hotbabe4U&quot; on chatfinder
or even a vulgar four letter word.  There's no adult
content and every photo is screened and edited.  Dull?
 Not exactly.  There are actually some intelligent
people trying to communicate with other intelligent
people (SETI for iChat?). Some speculate that Apple
quietly funded this site to encourage iSight sales. 
But, like all quality services (think .mac), there is
a fee ($7 per mpnth or $40 per year) although the free
basic service does have some value.  If you don't
usually mingle with internet drifters and can afford
to be selective, this is your place... it's worth it. 
Note that the paid upgrade automatically renews
(posted on the site) but you can easily cancel
renewals with an email to support.  Ages 18+

With four party video chat introduced with OS X 10.4
Tiger, the fun with iChat AV is just beginning!
