I've been using PBs as my main Macs for a few years, like the other 
posters I never shut them down, even while travelling. I can't 
remember the last time I shut one down actually. I dont bother saving 
everything or quitting everything or whatever, either, when putting 
it to sleep. That'd take forever. ;-) I do however do regular 
automated backups to an external HD.

And like the others I've occasionally encountered the same problem of 
it not waking up when I open the lid, even after some key presses.

Here's what I try, one of them will usually work ... if none work 
then I press control-option-power on (that's the shortcut, right? I 
forget) for a hard reboot (last resort of course .. only needed to do 
this about twice in my life).

- Shut the lid again, wait a sec, open it again.
- Press and hold for a few seconds on any key
- Press and hold on the Brightness button (F2) ... I read this 
somewhere and half the time it works
- Press on the Power On key ... doesn't reboot it, but sometimes 
wakes it up, like a glass of cold water poured over its head
- Check the light at the end of the power cable going into the Mac 
... it should show yellow (charging) or green (fully charged). If you 
don't see any light at all, it's not plugged in all the way or it's 
not getting power from the outlet it's plugged into. The Mac won't 
wake up if its battery is depleted and it's not getting power from 
the plug. (This just happened to me just yesterday in fact ... plug 
wasn't fully seated into the Mac and it had been like that for about 
a long time I guess. I pushed it in another 1/4 inch, it turned 
yellow, and I could wake it up.)
