Just as another data point, much of that software is several years  
old too. Why does that matter? Because much of it runs just as well  
under VPC as it does on a Windows machine. My sister (a PC family)  
and I had a little &quot;competition&quot;  a couple years ago. She had her  
Dell P4, I had my G4 Quicksilver with VPC. Our kids brought home all  
kinds of games from the public library -most Windows games generally  
requiring Win 95/ME. I was able to run just as many PC games as she  
could. Yes, some of the &quot;newer&quot; ones were noticeably slower on  the  
Mac, but then she couldn't run any of the Mac games.

Now if we're talking about software written in the last couple years,  
the story would be completely different. But partially because of  
that little experiment, I always wonder if its true when someone says  
their PC will run more software, or they have to have a PC to run  
some legacy app.

Just some food for thought. If you're really going to be running a PC  
only app for your livelihood, I'm not going to say a PC isn't your  
best choice.
