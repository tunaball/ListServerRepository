<PRE>Look Jeff,
Apple is not going to offer SLOWER Macs via Intel processors. They  
will offer FASTER Macs always. It starts with a killer PowerBook  
based on Intel Dual Core Yohah processors running @ 2.5 GHz by  
January 2006 at the latest.

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=21091">http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=21091</A>&gt;

I too will not be giving up my NEW (not a demo not refurbished) dual  
2.5 G5 I got for $1999 at Fry's last Saturday. ; ^ ) And I already  
had a dual 2 G5 I bought a year ago for the same price from Apple  
refurbished.

But it's ain't wicked fast at ALL. I am currently watching it creep  
along at what will be several hours crunching a broadcast digital  
video recording in SD with my EyeTV 500 into a DivX avi file under  
Panther 10.3.9/QT 6.5.2 'cause the DivX plug in for Tiger/QT 7 isn't  
ready yet.

There is no way I am going to want to keep this DOG any longer than I  
have to so I can encode and transcode video way faster than it takes  
today.

I agree that PPCs are fast and that would be true for me all the time  
were it not for the fact that I am heavily into video transcoding and  
compressing as well as audio recording. For multimedia applications  
like these, there is no such thing as fast. It's still a major  
waiting game over here Jeff.
