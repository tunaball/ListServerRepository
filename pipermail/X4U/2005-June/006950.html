Since you say you have looked for a substitute, you may want to 
consider hiring help.

My firm has been constructing true cross platform applications since 
1998, and I have been &quot;in&quot; software for twenty years. If you have an 
application that doesn't run on MacOS, give me a call. I will review it 
with you and offer an estimate to create a &quot;work-alike&quot; application. 
Typically we can satisfy a large percentage of customer requirements 
with existing modules, or there are open source projects that can be 
customized for you, so the cost is far less than building everything 
from scratch. With the estimate in hand you can analyze your specific 
business case.

Will it cost more than QuickBooks?
	Yes.
Will it take years and cost millions?
	No. (Apologies to Randy for the contradiction)
What if it does?
	Then we don't do it. We are not shy about shopping the project with 
your permission so there may be a way to get it done.

Obviously we are not the only firm involved in such work. I am certain 
many on this list are just as capable. In today's flat world the 
opportunity for modest financial success with a small number of users 
is very real, unlike days of old (circa 2001, for example) when the 
tools were awful, geeks thought they were gods and everything was 
proprietary.

Onward,
