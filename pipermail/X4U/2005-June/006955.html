Yes John - that's actually what my situation was several years back for some
crazy reason ...

&gt;<i>If that was the case and other
</I>&gt;<i> preferences files are read only, you have severe permissions problems with
</I>&gt;<i> your setup. AFAIK, they should all be read &amp; write for you (the admin user
</I>&gt;<i> and your username group)-at least that's what mine show.
</I>
 I noticed something else that maybe you can shed some light on ... For a
very long time now, when I save a Web-page in safari, the save window opens
very slowly - then I save - then it closes slowly also...

*  as of this morning - after applying some of the changes in this thread -
which basically amounted to  fooling with this preference text:

 &lt;key&gt;WebKitHistoryAgeInDaysLimit&lt;/key&gt;
 &lt;string&gt;365&lt;/string&gt;
 &lt;key&gt;WebKitHistoryItemLimit&lt;/key&gt;
 &lt;string&gt;9999&lt;/string&gt;

-  and trying some of your ideas and the terminal:

defaults write com.apple.safari WebKitHistoryItemLimit 1000

... *  then I am happy to report that the safari save window has gone from a
dead slow crawl to lightning fast!!!!

Q:   the question I have is why did this happen? Since I believe my old
WebKitHistoryItemLimit was something small like 200 (verses some incredibly
large number) ...  I don't know how this would affect the  save window...
Any ideas? Even more importantly -  if this happens again in the future -
how can I fix it again?

Also -  I am keeping my fingers crossed - but it appears ( prior to this
thread) -  that the latest version of safari has fixed longstanding bug:

-  let's assume we had a Web-page listing lots of other Web page articles -
( such as a Google search results page)
-  I would sometimes command click from the main page, on 10 or more of the
links - opening up 10 separate pages -  then I would go through them one by
one and hand save each individually ...  The bug was - that sometimes
randomly in the middle of trying to save - safari would crash -  no
particular order or reason ...  Now this problem has seemed to vanish - but
as I said I am keeping my fingers crossed ...

...  Many times I submitted a bug report to Apple - maybe they finally
listened


Thanks for your help - RevDave
