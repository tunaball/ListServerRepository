<PRE>At 4:52 PM +0200 on 6/8/05, Oskar Lissheim-Boethius spoke about Re: 
[X4U] Apple's move to Intel chips...  It's all about DR thusly:

&gt;<i>You left the Wintel platform for Mac recently? One of the big 
</I>&gt;<i>benefits with this platform is that you _can_ actually do just this. 
</I>&gt;<i>At least with Mac's that can run OSX which iMac's from 1999 still 
</I>&gt;<i>can do. And with some hacks you can get 10-year-old computers 
</I>&gt;<i>running it. It's _very_ cool.
</I>
I just took my last Mac that does not run OS X natively out of 
service -- at 11 years of age it was churning along as a mail server, 
working just fine -- I just decided with a cable connection at both 
ends of my work journey, that relying on &quot;outhouse&quot; servers was good 
enough. And at 11 years of age I finally began to wonder about its 
durability. During one hardware crisis (in another box) at about 6 
years of age it was temporarily someone's desktop work station.

I find it extraordinary that at the moment our oldest daily use Mac 
is about 4 years old -- extraordinary that it's so new while being 
our oldest.

One of the features of Apple market share has always been that while 
its customer base is very loyal, their returning to buy another one 
has always been slower than on the PC side. Thus the installed and 
utilized share of the market is quite higher than the sold-last-night 
share.
