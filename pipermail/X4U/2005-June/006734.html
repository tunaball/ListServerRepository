<PRE>Sure, and I agree that Apple is right not to promote OSX as a  
solution for generic PCs. I'd even strongly support them in  
emphasizing the benefits of Genuine Mac on a marketing level. But  
there's a continuum between not-supporting and actively blocking, and  
I'll still be disappointed if they put serious engineering resources  
into preventing unsupported installs. (Not that I expect them to care  
much about my opinions, except maybe when I'm ready to pull out the  
checkbook....)
