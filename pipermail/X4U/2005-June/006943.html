Yeah, um, as I said I lived on the Windows side of things for several  
years now and only recently came to the Mac, and haven't missed  
anything.

But that mouse illustration was good, I may use it sometime ;-)

At least Judi made an effort to answer the question as to WHAT APPS  
they are talking about, rather than devolving into a &quot;Mac stuff is  
better&quot; vs &quot;Windows has more stuff&quot;

Ah yes... now voice recognition I will definitely grant you.

The stuff that Judi mentioned I don't even have on my PC.  I've used  
Trillian before but I never got into &quot;I have to be in 7 different  
chat forums&quot;

Anyway, if anyone has *SPECIFIC* apps that they miss on Windows  
(there were a few), I'd love to see that.
