<PRE>Yes, this is what I was seeing in the new move.

Think about it.

Apple allow OSX to run on another platform.
Many existing users decide not to upgrade to a new Mac but get a cheaper 
alternative PC.
Hardware sales for Apple drop.
Sale of OSX rises a little as people who own a PC give it a go but know 
(or find out too late) that most of their existing software won't run on 
it.

or

Apple don't allow OSX to run on other platforms.
Apple designs a Mac that dual boots OSX and Windows giving them direct 
acces to the PC market. Perhaps they even market the machine as &quot;Get the 
best of both worlds&quot;
*Existing* Mac user base remains relatively same as they like OSX and 
can't use it elsewhere.
PC users learn that they can buy the beautiful, reliable and fast Macs and 
still be able to run their existing software on it.
Apple's hardware sales increase.
PC users have their first play on OSX coz it came bundled with the Mac.... 
and like it!!!

Of course if Microsoft feel threatened they can always revise their future 
Windows upgrades to rely on a hardware setup/chip/whatever that the Mac 
doesn't have in order to run.

Personally, I see doors opening for us.

I was also thinking that Virtual PC could be a thing of the past but the 
one thing Virtual PC does offer that &quot;dual boot&quot; doesn't is the ability to 
have both platforms running simultaneously, without having to boot in and 
out of different OS's.

Now, if Apple can get OSX to be able to run Windows based apps natively in 
OSX then that will really be SOMETHING!

Consider: these Macs will run Windows directly, not in emulation. 
Hence a Wintel dependent shop that appreciates industrial design will 
have the chance to buy Apple and change nothing else. The highest 
quality Windows box you can buy. Wintel folks can buy Apple.

Mac-centric folks can still buy Apple. And an Appletel  box  can run 
Windows software in an Mac-centric shop. No one needs Virtual PC.

Hmmmm.
