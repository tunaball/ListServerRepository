Well, while something like that would be well and good, and the  
overall cost (as opposed to leasing the service from the ADP folks)  
it would seem to be that to have access to the data from the  
automobile builders themselves, for a single shop, could run more  
than what we pay now.
Remember, this app has all the vehicle repairs parts and repair times  
built into it, and is updated monthly.
As a application builder, it would seem to me a better idea to  
approach the insurance companies to see what their requirements are,  
and go from there.
As was mentioned, even by name, State Farm controls how we upload  
data to them.
Now, there are 3 different companies that sell the programs, ADP,  
Mitchell, and I forgot the third. I would think that an enterprising  
company would take it upon themselves to make and market one.
Since no one has, it is my guess is that ADP, Mitchell and the last  
one got out, made the program and sold it as a Windows based program.
The light at the end of the tunnel, I believe, is that ADP is going  
to a web based format. I am sure they will require IE latest version,  
so I will see how that works out. But, if Safari works well enough,  
we MAY be able to get into a Mac after all.
In THAT case, I will begin to sell my services to the repair shops  
and see if I can move some Mac's, since all other things being equal,  
and knowing what I do about the needs of a body shop, a Mac would be  
better!
