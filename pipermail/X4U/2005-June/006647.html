    Torvald's response came quickly and succinctly. &quot;My main machine
    these days is a dual 2GHz G5 (aka PowerPC 970)--it's physically a
    regular Apple Mac, although it obviously only runs Linux, so I don't
    think you can call it a Mac any more ;)&quot; he wrote.

    &quot;As to the why...Part of it is simply that I wanted to try something
    else, and I felt like there were enough people testing the x86 side
    that it certainly didn't need me. Part of it is that I personally
    believe there are two main architectures out there: Power and x86-64
    are what _I_ think are the two most relevant ones, and I decided
    that I had to at least check the other side of it out seriously if
    I really believed that,&quot; he wrote.

    But the kernel guru sought to stop any potential accusations of
    favoritism in their tracks: &quot;And don't read anything really deep
    into that--Linux supports 20+ architectures, and the fact that I
    personally think that two of them are more likely to be the most
    relevant really doesn't mean all that much. It's just a personal
    quirk of mine.&quot;

    As it turns out, this key figure behind the Linux insurgency is
    probably not all that different from any other technology enthusiast.

    &quot;Oh, and part of it is that I got the machine for free,&quot; said
    Torvalds. &quot;I'm really a technology whore.&quot;

Can we quit the ill-informed speculation now please and JUST WAIT UNTIL 
MONDAY????   ;D

Stroller.
