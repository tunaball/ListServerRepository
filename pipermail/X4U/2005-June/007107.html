<PRE>WiFi finders come under the category of a tech-no toy.  They may be  
fun to play with, but for most people they are totally unnecessary.  
(A friend of mine has one on his keychain.)  If you open up your  
iBook can can see what open networks are available.

There are open networks every where. Usually this is because people  
forgot to or didn't know how to turn on security their wireless  
router. However you should be aware there is some risk in joining a  
untrusted (unknown) network. This can be either wireless or hard  
wired. These networks can be setup to listen in to your connection to  
steal person information (passwords, credit card numbers, etc..).

Your home D-Link Router supports the nominal encryption schemes. If  
your password was setup to support one of them, than you network is  
probably ok. They'll break into open network down the street ;-). The  
reason it doesn't ask for a password at home could be that it did  
once and saved it in your computers password keychain. You've just  
forgotten about it.  However if what you are calling a password is a  
SSID or network name, then you are running a open network to the  
thanks of some neighbors.
