Well, I would, but it seems I can't access it either. I'm not a  
subscriber, so I don't know exactly how I was able to view it before,  
but it didn't occur to me that it was restricted that way since I was  
able to read it.

If I remember correctly, the article was simply pointing out that in  
Apple's documentation about creating Universal Binaries, there was  
mention of Intel's 32-bit architecture, but no mention at all about  
64-bit. I think they were assuming that meant that at this phase, at  
least, 64-bit was possibly not part of the plan.

Since then, however, I've read a lot of additional speculation, most  
of it suggesting that it's too soon to tell - and that perhaps part  
of the reason Apple is planning a &quot;bottom up&quot; strategy for the  
changeover (i.e. lower spec hardware first), is that it gives more  
time for Intel to come up with the &quot;right&quot; processor for the &quot;pro&quot;  
level machines, including being 64-bit.

I'm not aware of any official announcements on any of this.
