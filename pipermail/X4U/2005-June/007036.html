I would bet that he got just what he thought was best.

2 thoughts on this thread. One is that the people who respond to a 
thread like this will most always feel that security is a necessity. 
Those that believe is mesh networks don't bother to speak up against 
the foil hat types.

What I am getting at is that I've set up over a hundred wireless 
networks for my business clients. On every one of them, I've set them 
up as open networks. Not a single client has ever had a problem with 
this type of setup. They locked down their servers and computers and 
knowingly have their internet connections open. My philosophy is akin 
to the fact that we don't lock up our water hoses in front of our 
homes, so why do we lock up our wireless internet access? The 
borrowing of our internet access costs us no more than when someone 
borrows a drink from our water hose. My business clients enjoy the 
ease of access for new equipment and also for guests when they visit 
the business.

I set the SSID of my clients networks to a code that tells me which 
network it is (usually a location code) and then I append my phone 
number with area code (since there are lots of area codes in my 
client region). This enables anyone with a question or problem of 
administration to contact me. The only contacts I've ever had were 
from some wanting to be helpful geek to might call me and ask me if I 
know that my phone number is being broadcast on my insecure network. 
I laugh and say yes it took a moment of my time to make it happen and 
how might I help them. They never have any real reason to call other 
than to advise me that I am running an insecure network (hence the 
comment about who usually replies to these threads). Again, my 
clients have never had a problem (admittedly that they know of) but I 
like to think I'd know about it since I am their network admin.

My point is, open your network and share. The world is a better place 
when people share what they have extra of and won't cost them 
anything to offer to others in need. It may also help you someday as 
you roam around with a Powerbook and need a signal. Thankfully the 
paranoia of insecure networks escapes most people's attention and the 
default settings from the manufacturers allows me and others like me 
to catch a signal without too much trouble. But why are people so 
interested in making sure that no one benefits from their surplus? 
You do understand that the 'thief' must be within a hundred feet of 
your exterior walls right? Are you really thinking that there are 
that many thiefs who want to harm you that are that close to you? If 
so, I'd move to a different home.

Don't worry. I forgot your name too!
