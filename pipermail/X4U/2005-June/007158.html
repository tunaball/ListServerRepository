<PRE>I've had my 17&quot; pb since March and never shut it off. I just close  
the lid and sleep it for it's daily trip back and forth to the  
office, as well as a recent trip to Seattle. I only reboot for  
updates when required. I would think you should expect the same  
reliability of the latest revision pb. I did, however have a rev. A  
Titanium that occasionally would not wake up properly, but even that  
wasn't very often.
