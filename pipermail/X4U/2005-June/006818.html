Yes, that is what he *showed*... and I suspect that's probably what  
was in the box, a Pentium4 3.6Ghz -- although I also suspect that  
Steve has enough pull at Apple that the About this Mac could have  
said whatever he wanted.

I found another link to the story I saw:

HD for Indies ( <A HREF="http://www.hdforindies.com/">http://www.hdforindies.com/</A> ) quotes AppleInsider:

AppleInsider | Extremely powerful Pentium system used to demo Mac OS  
X on Intel It's believed Apple required an extra boost in the quad- 
pentium system to highlight Rosetta, a dynamic binary translator used  
to convert existing PowerPC binaries to run on the Intel platform  
transparently to the user and in real-time.
- now it looks like Apple might have been demo-ing on a quad  
processor system after all. I don't trust that this is right, but  
it's worth finding out the truth.

But the AI article - <A HREF="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1117">http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1117</A>  
- is no longer there.

Not to be a conspiracy theorist or anything ;-) (my tendency would be  
to trust that what we were shown was accurate) but it seems a little  
odd that AI would just delete the story rather than write that they  
had confirmation that it was just a single Pentium4 in Steve's demo  
box -- or at least a retraction saying that they had no good  
confirmation of it being anything else.

There's always such fun, second-guessing, and general FUD just before  
and just after a keynote from Steve!
