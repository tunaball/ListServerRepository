	You're right, twice.  	There is a check box.  And it does have to do 
with your new ISP.

	I'm having the opposite problem.  I want my ISP to offer this service 
and they don't.  I'd try yours but we're evidently on different 
continents.


	The checkbox is hard to find.  Open system preferences.  Click on 
network. This should give you a list of networks (Internal modem, 
airport, etc)

	Click on the list item Internal Modem.  This should give you a screen 
that includes a bar divided into PPP, TCP/IP, Proxies, and Modem.

	Click on Modem.  This should give you a screen that has a checkbox 
about two-thirds way down the page that says &quot;Connection notify me of 
incoming calls while connected to the internet.&quot;  Uncheck this box or 
chose one of the options below it.

	As I understand it, the service that your ISP offers is called &quot;Modem 
on Hold.&quot;  Supposedly, you should be able to interrupt your internet 
session, answer the call, then go back on-line without having to hang 
up your internet connection.  I have never done this, but that's the 
way the theory is explained.  You might ask your ISP how it works.  It 
could be a good deal.
