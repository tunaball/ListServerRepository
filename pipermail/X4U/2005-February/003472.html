RevDave,

Here is what I posted to this list on this subject in July 2003:

&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Don't know if TAC has a solution yet but this is on the Apple 
</I>&gt;<i>discussion list and its bit me too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I had my iSight &quot;daisy chained&quot; via an external (powered Iceberg) 
</I>&gt;<i>FireWire drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My PB G4 (1Ghz / 1GB, 10.2.6) was running a little low on free space 
</I>&gt;<i>(512Mb free) when suddenly the FireWire drive disappeared off the 
</I>&gt;<i>Desktop accompanied by the warning about it not being correctly 
</I>&gt;<i>removed. I didn't drag its icon to the trash, nor did the drive's 
</I>&gt;<i>power supply fluctuate. (Other posters to the Apple Discussion list 
</I>&gt;<i>didn't mention low free disk space on the internal drive.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>When I rebooted, OS X politely told me that the drive was unreadable 
</I>&gt;<i>and did I want to initialize it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway I now have a very sad drive (Disk Warrior 3 can't see it, 
</I>&gt;<i>Disk Utility can see it but can't fix it and Norton's System Works 2 
</I>&gt;<i>and 3 don't get anywhere either). I tried getting to it via OS 9 
</I>&gt;<i>(who said a dual boot machine was no good) but no joy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've dropped the drive off to get a quote on data recovery.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway I don't know if its a coincidence or if iSight doesn't like 
</I>&gt;<i>to share FireWire connections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Given the the drive had its own power supply I'm not sure if a 
</I>&gt;<i>FireWire hub would improve things (besides its another mess of 
</I>&gt;<i>cables on the desk).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Maybe iSight 2 needs a separate power supply (or to daisy chain off 
</I>&gt;<i>the PB's AC adapter)?
</I>
This is what one of my technical contacts at Apple suggested (no 
admission of guilt etc.):

&gt;<i>You'll probably find that the problem is caused by the iSight's 
</I>&gt;<i>power requirements. As far as I know, it needs to be connected 
</I>&gt;<i>directly to  Mac in order to obtain enough voltage to work properly. 
</I>&gt;<i>Chances are what has happened is that because the iSight was being 
</I>&gt;<i>daisy-chained off the icecube, it was trying to obtain power from 
</I>&gt;<i>the icecube case, therefore putting too much load in the case. If 
</I>&gt;<i>there are enough firewire ports available, try connecting the isight 
</I>&gt;<i>directly to the Mac, failing that, try a powered firewire hub.
</I>
There was much discussion on the Apple Boards about it at the time.

I recovered the data and always use a powered FireWire hub with my 
iSight if I ever want to use another FireWire device on my 
PowerBook's single port.

As far as I know there has never been a patch for this issue (unless 
it was part of the iSight UPdate 1.0.2 rolled out in February, 2004).
