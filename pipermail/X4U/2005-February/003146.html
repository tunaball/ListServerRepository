<PRE>Hello,

I'm using 10.3.6 and Mail.app.

Yesterday I sent a whole bunch of individual emails to my mother. The 
emails were photos sent thru iPhoto 4's email button. Each one was 
about 500kB.


When sending these photo's, many got returned to me as undeliverable 
because &quot;The user(s) account is temporarily over quota.&quot; My mom uses 
Adelphia cable.

When they got returned to me I deleted them all, because I decided to 
just put them on a CD and bring them over to her house.

However, two to the emails returned to me I can't seem to delete. When 
I hit the delete button, the headers for them in the viewer window get 
greyed out, but the emails stay in the folder. They don't appear in the 
Trash folder in Mail.

Furthermore, the Delete button know becomes an Undelete button.

If I try to drag them to the trash folder I get an error message that 
says &quot;The destination mailbox does not exist&quot;.

Although it does exist 'cause everything else gets deleted just fine.

I can drag them to another mail folder, and it will transfer OK, but 
the original still stays in the first folder.

If I press the newly created Undelete key, the header becomes bold 
again.

Rebuilding the mailbox doesn't seem to help.

Can anyone offer any suggestions?

Thanks,

David
