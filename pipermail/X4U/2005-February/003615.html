<PRE>Further to the note below, I have just discovered that if the owner of the 
volume is set to Administrator (my login account name)rather than &quot;root&quot; 
(whic is the default) and I save it then I'm able to press the &quot;Copy&quot; 
button to apply to enclosed items.

However, I still don't know if I'm going about this the right way.... &lt;8-}

        Subject:        [X4U] OSX Server Permissions help


Hi all,

I'm moving our OS9 AppleShare IP Server over to OSX Server. I'm mostly 
there but have run into an issue.

I have created all my user and group accounts and I've set up share points 

with relevant group access to the parent partitions but there are specific 

folders within each volume that require different permissions.

For example, I have a &quot;Base Arts&quot; folder (that houses all our templates) 
and the group CREATIVE has read only permissions but the BASE ARTS EDITORS 

group needs read/write access.

When I'm inside Workgroup Manager do I set the group to BASE ARTS EDITORS 
with read/write permissions then leave Others to Read Only or is there a 
more appropriate way?

Also, if I was to set this parent folder called &quot;Base Arts&quot; to Group: BASE 

ARTS EDITORS Read/write and Others: Read Only, how on earth do I set the 
enclosed items to be the same? There is a &quot;copy&quot; button next to &quot;Copy 
these privileges to enclosed items&quot; but it is greyed out. The only other 
way I have been able to adjust permissions on sub folders so far was to 
get Info on the &quot;Base Arts&quot; folder in the Finder and set them there, 
clicking the &quot;Apply to Enclosed Items&quot; button. Unfortunately, the group 
name doesn't get copied but the privilege of Read/Write does.

I'm concerned I'm gunna mess it up doing it this way but I have to be able 

to change privileges to enclosed items otherwise the editors are not going 

to have read/write access to the folders they need, right?

Further to this I just discovered that our partition called &quot;DESIGN FILE 
SHARING&quot; (where we do all of our shared work) is set to Group: CREATIVE, 
read/write (as it was set in Workgroup Manager) but all the sub folders 
are group: unknown , Read Only. There are hundreds of files/folders in 
this volume that I need to be able to change all together to the right 
setting.

I'm sure I'm going about this the wrong way. Until now this way has worked 

for me under OS9's AppleShare IP server setup.

Thanks for your help!

Cheers,

Cojcolds
