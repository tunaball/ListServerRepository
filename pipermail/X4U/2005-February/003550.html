If you were buying a laser-printer then I would agree absolutely with 
you that HP is the way to go - indeed, if you have the space then you 
could do far worse than buying a secondhand Laserjet 4 or 5 just for 
your B&amp;W printing. The cost of having a second printer would pay for 
itself within the period over which you'd consume just a few black 
inkjet cartridges.

As far as colour inkjet printing is concerned, I'd urge you to look at 
the Canon Pixima range. I did a lot of research before buying my first 
colour printer last fall &amp; ended up with an IP3000. I paid c &#163;80 for 
mine.

It has one black &amp; three separate colour cartridges, each of which can 
be purchased &amp; replaced separately - ink levels in the clear-plastic 
cartridge are detected optically, so there is no electronics in them 
preventing you from using unbranded replacement refills.

The heads are not in the cartridge, and I had believed that they're are 
also a separate component &amp; separately replaceable, but I am unable to 
find references to verify this. However I don't think the Pixima will 
clog the way your Epson has - it can be set to sleep after 5 minutes 
without use, and it'll wake automatically when you start to use it. 
Mine must easily go for 2 weeks at a time between uses, and the forums 
at &lt;<A HREF="http://club.cdfreaks.com/">http://club.cdfreaks.com/</A>&gt; are full of disappointed Epson users 
raving about these Canons.

All the Pixima range do duplex printing, although if you're US-based 
Canon have disabled the ability to print directly on CD due to patent 
issues. If you want better photo quality the IP4000 has a fifth 
cartridge with a second shade of black; personally I'm quite happy with 
the quality of print from the IP3000 - I'm probably not very demanding 
about colour photos (they look great to me!), but I'm happy enough with 
the black text &amp; colour letterheads when I print business letters.

Whilst I salute you for being prepared to pay extra for quality - I 
wish more of my customers were the same - this is stunning value at 
$62.95 from Newegg.com. If you need any more convincing, read Amazon's 
customer reviews &lt;<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/5qzyh">http://tinyurl.com/5qzyh</A>&gt; where it gets an average of 
5/5 stars.

Stroller.
