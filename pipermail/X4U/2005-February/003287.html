We run 4.11 under Classic at my work every day, unfortunately. There 
are a few issues that you'll have to work around.

First, it won't work if the user running it doesn't own the folder and 
have write permission on all of the files in it. On the plus side, you 
don't need to run Quark's nasty installer for each copy you need on a 
given machine. In addition to the staff member's user, we have an IT 
user with administrator privileges on each machine, and keep the master 
Quark copy for the machine in IT's Public folder. Then when Quark 
inevitably screws up a user's copy, they know to delete their copy and 
go into ~it/Public and copy the QX411 folder from there into their own 
user's Applications directory.

Secondly, the fonts all look like crap, but it turns out you can still 
run ATM in your Classic System, and that half-fixes the problem. You'll 
still occasionally need to zoom out and zoom back in to force it to 
regenerate the font glyphs, but that usually fixes the problem. We do 
have a problem where Classic will occasionally appear to lock up every 
few days, but I can't tell if it's just Quark being crashy or because 
we're using ATM which isn't technically supposed to work at all.

Palettes occasionally vanish. if a palette is not completely on top of 
a Quark window, it will occasionally disappear. You have to close &amp; 
reopen them by the menu to get them back. I think it's easier to just 
stretch the Quark window to completely cover the screen, but my 
Production guys can't stand that.

Quark windows sometimes don't realize they've been clicked on if you 
try to click them to bring Quark to the foreground when you're working 
in a native OS X application. Command-tabbing out of Quark and then 
back will usually make Quark realize it's in the foreground.

I don't know if this will do any good for 3.31, but we're able to do 
production work with 4.11.
