<PRE>The IT folks here have the same bias, although they do allow our Macs on the
network but they tell us they, &quot;look the other way&quot; which pisses me off but
what can you do. They've never had a problem with a Mac.



&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you kidding?  It has been my experience (and the experience of 2
</I>&gt;<i> relatives and 2 friends, all at different companies), that corporate IT
</I>&gt;<i> folks will refuse to allow Macs on their networks.  My mom has been
</I>&gt;<i> desperately trying to get her Powerbook online at her work, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;giver&quot; of IP addresses denies every request because they cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;proven&quot; secure since his tools can't scan her machine.  Even when some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of worm hosed all the PC's, she was forced to dial in to send an
</I>&gt;<i> important email (work-related).  When everyone else saw that she was
</I>&gt;<i> online via dialup, they used her Powerbook to access their webmail.
</I>&gt;<i> All except for Mr. Stubborn the IT Wizard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My dad, working at a bank headquarters (not a bank branch with money,
</I>&gt;<i> tellers, etc.), got laughed out of the building by IT when he suggested
</I>&gt;<i> that they let his emergency backup iBook on the network since his
</I>&gt;<i> company-issued machine had gotten infected on-site and was unusable.
</I>&gt;<i> He just wanted to send some excel charts to his supervisor.  He didn't
</I>&gt;<i> have dialup, so he got to wait until the next day to do his work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PC-centric IT folks know that 1) allowing macs on their networks breed
</I>&gt;<i> more macs and 2) more macs mean less need for their expensive @sses.
</I>&gt;<i> We know macs are about 10,000 times safer than PC's, using that as an
</I>&gt;<i> argument never works, it just pisses IT folks off the edge.  From my
</I>&gt;<i> experience, only PC's configured by the IT department and locked down
</I>&gt;<i> are the only machines allowed on the corporate networks I've been
</I>&gt;<i> exposed to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the rant.  One of us has some very abnormal business
</I>&gt;<i> computer-related experiences.  Perhaps you were being cynical when you
</I>&gt;<i> said &quot;If they've got a clue&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Peter
