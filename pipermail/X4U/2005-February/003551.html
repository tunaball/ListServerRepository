<PRE>Hah! I just ordered out a Canon PIXMA IP3000. What can I lose?
And, there sure are some happy customers!
One of them did mention the separate print head. I guess I'm going to 
have to contact Canon about that item, but for now, I'll be putting it 
into service in a couple of days.

Thanks for the reasoned response.
I'll report back...

</I>&gt;<i> If you were buying a laser-printer then I would agree absolutely with 
</I>&gt;<i> you that HP is the way to go - indeed, if you have the space then you 
</I>&gt;<i> could do far worse than buying a secondhand Laserjet 4 or 5 just for 
</I>&gt;<i> your B&amp;W printing. The cost of having a second printer would pay for 
</I>&gt;<i> itself within the period over which you'd consume just a few black 
</I>&gt;<i> inkjet cartridges.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as colour inkjet printing is concerned, I'd urge you to look at 
</I>&gt;<i> the Canon Pixima range. I did a lot of research before buying my first 
</I>&gt;<i> colour printer last fall &amp; ended up with an IP3000. I paid c &#163;80 for mine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It has one black &amp; three separate colour cartridges, each of which can 
</I>&gt;<i> be purchased &amp; replaced separately - ink levels in the clear-plastic 
</I>&gt;<i> cartridge are detected optically, so there is no electronics in them 
</I>&gt;<i> preventing you from using unbranded replacement refills.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The heads are not in the cartridge, and I had believed that they're are 
</I>&gt;<i> also a separate component &amp; separately replaceable, but I am unable to 
</I>&gt;<i> find references to verify this. However I don't think the Pixima will 
</I>&gt;<i> clog the way your Epson has - it can be set to sleep after 5 minutes 
</I>&gt;<i> without use, and it'll wake automatically when you start to use it. Mine 
</I>&gt;<i> must easily go for 2 weeks at a time between uses, and the forums at 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://club.cdfreaks.com/">http://club.cdfreaks.com/</A>&gt; are full of disappointed Epson users raving 
</I>&gt;<i> about these Canons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All the Pixima range do duplex printing, although if you're US-based 
</I>&gt;<i> Canon have disabled the ability to print directly on CD due to patent 
</I>&gt;<i> issues. If you want better photo quality the IP4000 has a fifth 
</I>&gt;<i> cartridge with a second shade of black; personally I'm quite happy with 
</I>&gt;<i> the quality of print from the IP3000 - I'm probably not very demanding 
</I>&gt;<i> about colour photos (they look great to me!), but I'm happy enough with 
</I>&gt;<i> the black text &amp; colour letterheads when I print business letters.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whilst I salute you for being prepared to pay extra for quality - I wish 
</I>&gt;<i> more of my customers were the same - this is stunning value at $62.95 
</I>&gt;<i> from Newegg.com. If you need any more convincing, read Amazon's customer 
</I>&gt;<i> reviews &lt;<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/5qzyh">http://tinyurl.com/5qzyh</A>&gt; where it gets an average of 5/5 stars.
