I have recently read (can't recall where...) that all is not well with 
one recent Security Update.
So, just as a heads up, I mention it. It might not be OSX 10.3.7 per se. 
It might be a glitch in the Security Update.
I don't know how or if you can undo a Security Update.

</I>
I don't use Mail, so perhaps that's why I have not experienced the 
universal slowness you mention?

&gt;<i> Each new connection to a web page

</I>
Yes, I agree. Other than some oddities, I like 10.3.7 a lot. It does 
seem a better OS incantation than the previous ones...

&gt;<i> I am using a 1.8 GHZ G5 with 1GB RAM. I updated all 3 of my FireWire 
</I>&gt;<i> hard drives (Granite Digital 120 GB, LaCie 120 GB, LaCie 250GB), and I
