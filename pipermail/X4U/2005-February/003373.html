<PRE>A friend of mine has 2 macs in his office -  and wanted to purchase a router
so that they could both be on the Internet and doing some file sharing. ( I
guess currently only one computer is on the Net -  the other is just a non
Internet Business Computer right now.)

I  suggested that his company might already be on a Bigger master router
system ( there are about 30 employees) -  and he thought that most likely
there was some previous system set up and that he was already receiving 1
Ethernet cable that was probably on that system already - he wasn't sure -
but that is my guess. However, he still wants to purchase a router to set up
these computers in his room.

So I am asking - is it possible to purchase a router and set up on top of
another ( bigger) router. Let's assume that the large office gets 1 T1 line
coming and - and goes to a master router - and one Ethernet cable goes into
his office.  Can I then attach his private router to the end of that cable
and set up a &quot; sub system &quot; for his 2 computers?

 thanks to advance for your help - RevDave
