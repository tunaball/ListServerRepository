Yes, this is possible. I would try just using a switch (or, less
desirably, a hub) first, especially if the network uses DHCP (and the IT
guys allow the 2nd MAC address on the network). That would make things
much simpler, and cheaper.

Otherwise, just setup the router to use NAT and the 1st router will see
the two machines as having the same IP address. Of course, this is easier
said than done and implementation depends on the router. And depending on
how the network is set up, you may end up with NAT upon NAT... (it works,
but can be ugly).

So, there are a lot of variables. Seriously, see if you can go the
switch/hub route first. Is there some reason he can't ask the IT folks in
his large office?
