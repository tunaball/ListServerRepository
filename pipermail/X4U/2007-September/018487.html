A while back a number of people commented on my problem and I think  
that I have traced it to iCal. I now have 2GB of memory on the G5 so  
the spinning disk and slowing down is less of a problem but on the  
office G4 with 1GB memory the problem starts the moment I launch iCal  
and goes on for a good 15 mins. According to the Activity Monitor  
SynchServer goes into overdrive. In the case of the G5 it swallows  
up  95% of the CPU (in the top pane) or 45% user (in the lower pane).  
As you can guess I don't really know what that means.

So on the G5 with the extra memory the problem has gone away but not  
on the G4 where this did not used to be a problem. I would be good to  
find a solution to this irritating issue.
