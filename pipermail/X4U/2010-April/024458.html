<PRE>The G5's OS was Tiger 10.4.8. I upgraded using the retail version of the Leopard Install DVD. It booted and seems to be working OK except for the upgrade issues.
The Combos for both the PPC and Intel are combined into one file.   

The installer that is on the DVD seems to work fine. The &quot;installer&quot; that I suspect is the problem is the installer that manages the upgrade process from the downloads. I'm getting the same symptoms from 4 different stand-alone upgrade packages downloaded from Apple.


&gt;<i> I suppose if you did a fresh install (or archive and install) of 10.5.1 and just ran Software Update it will give you pretty much the equivalent of a Combo Update&#8230;you might give that a shot.
</I>
Actually, this was my original plan but but after I had 10.5.1 installed and operating, I found the Software Update hung up in a very similar fashion to what I've been seeing with the stand-alone updates.

 I'm about ready to try reinstalling Leopard because I'm running out of useful ideas. Fixing permissions had no effect.

I'd really like to get to the bottom of this one!

</I>&gt;<i> I can't remember if the Combo Updates come in Intel and PPC flavors or if it's just a single combo update. If they're different and you used one you previously downloaded it might be an Intel version.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Neil -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	Thanks for the prompt response.  I now have Leopard 10.5.1 installed on the iMac G5. I too, rarely use anything but but the &quot;stand-alone&quot; software update downloads from Apple.  But now I am unable to get make any of the upgrades work on the G5 with the newly installed OS X 10.5.1. (Remember that I have done these very updates before on this computer)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have tried both the Software Update... route and about three of the applicable standalone updates. They seem to all hang up as the Installer app starts to work. None of my attempts have gotten even to the first window where I usually have the opportunity to tell it to &quot;Continue&quot;.  I do see in a couple of places that the installer app is not responding.
