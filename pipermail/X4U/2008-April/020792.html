I'm more concerned that SpamSieve will automatically consider  
messages with my e-mail address in them as bad.

&gt;<i>

Nope.  They are clearly an odd sort of e-mail message to attack anti- 
spam programs, not a spam spoof bounce.  I can tell by the fact that  
they aren't selling anything in the body text, and that I only get  
one or two a day, and they change every day within certain parameters.

</I>
I'm not so sure.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SpamSieve is still accurate enough for me, but more and more spam

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From what I've seen and heard, SpamSieve's accuracy over the past

</I>
My experience hasn't been the same.  I've had some clients report  
lately that they have abandoned SpamSieve, after several years of  
use, because it had become less accurate.  Some of my clients in a  
business setting have opted for challenge/response anti-spam services.

But, as I said, I still personally find SpamSieve to be a great  
program, and reliable enough to recommend.  But the war with spammers  
isn't over.
