I'm pretty sure that Cat 5 is within specification for gigabit - the  
differences between the 3 aren't really that significant.

My laptop has definitely configured itself to gigabit when connected  
to 25' - and probably 25m - runs.

You're unlikely to notice any difference between the three.

Honestly, this is unlikely to be important.

When I was at uni - perhaps 7 years ago? - I had a friend who still  
had a 10mBit card. Instead of transferring in less than 2 minutes, as  
I had come to expect - CD images took over 20 minutes (and perhaps  
nearer to 30).

Based on that back-of-a-fag-packet maths you can expect a CD image to  
transfer in under 12 seconds using gigabit, only for a DVD's worth of  
data are you up to 2 minutes again.

You're pretty much maxing out a fast hard-drive at gigabit, so -  
overlooking any thing else going on in your computer - you're  
probably not going to be able to wrap TCP header information around  
it &amp; still get it down the wire at the same speed. I think I've read  
of people being quite happy getting c 600mbps or 700mbps out of  
gigabit in the real world, although I don't know the details or if  
that's current.

Stroller.
