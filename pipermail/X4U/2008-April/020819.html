Interesting. Our whole family is considering switching from Sprint so 
we can buy iPhones. I have spent some time investigating plans and 
coverage. It does appear that in some areas of the country, the AT&amp;T 
coverage is better than other providers.

&gt;<i>Lastly, new and improved apps are going to be coming out for the iPhone.  It
</I>&gt;<i>wasn't a horrendously high fee to cancel service with Verizon and our AT&amp;T
</I>&gt;<i>bill is actually cheaper as they charge extra for things like web access and
</I>&gt;<i>email.  On the iPhone, it's free.
</I>
But what does that mean? Every user on your AT&amp;T account pays $20 a 
month for internet and email. That's not free, though it's not 
prohibitively expensive. I can just say that my sister doesn't want 
an iPhone and if she goes with us to AT&amp;T, her phone will cost about 
$10 a month (as an added user on our account), whereas the rest of us 
will pay about $50. So that's not free.

&gt;<i>  So, in the long run, the savings with
</I>&gt;<i>AT&amp;T will make up for the charge of canceling service with Verizon.
</I>&gt;<i>Just a few things to think about, hope this helps in the decision process.
</I>
I have another question, not from your post. Someone said that the 
iPhone doesn't have a QWERTY &quot;keyboard.&quot; Is that true? Yesterday I 
was waiting in the local mall for a jewelry repair so wandered (of 
course) to the Apple Store there. I played awhile with an iPod Touch 
and was surprised and pleased to see that it had a QWERTY &quot;keyboard&quot; 
I did not play with an iPhone. Is the iPhone's keybard different from 
the iPod  Touch?
