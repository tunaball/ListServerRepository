Those might have been &quot;adequate&quot; answers, but they weren't answers that fit
his situation. He gave an answer appropriate to his situation: using a PC
machine isn't what he had in mind.

Perhaps it's just you. I don't feel patronized by that remark. It certainly
isn't something a typical Mac user is familiar with. He didn't say it was
something a Mac user couldn't do, wouldn't do, or was &quot;above&quot; doing -- just
something they aren't familiar with.

&gt;<i> Oh! Obviously Mac users are too good for that sort thing.
</I>
That's your own chip on your own shoulder. No one said that Mac users are
too good for that sort of thing. He *did* say he didn't have a Windows
computer to use, but that's not the same thing.
