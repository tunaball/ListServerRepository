No -- hehe -- though Logic is no ordinary audio application.  It came  
on 7-8 DVDs and took _hours_ to install.  I think the program that  
bugs me the most is Numbers.  Could be its problems are more v1.0- 
related than the video card.  Seems like there have been other  
programs (Adobe CS3 Web Premium maybe?) where I suspected a video  
upgrade would help, but right now which one(s) escape me.

&gt;&gt;<i> You're right about _affordable_ cards.  The 9600 PRO/256 is the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did the graphics card upgrade for my G4/450 AGP, and it cost about

</I>&gt;<i> running now, as I upgraded a few months later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the way I use a computer, and 2GB kits nearing the $100 mark,

Same here.  At some point it becomes pouring money down the drain.   
Like you I hope for a couple more years out of &quot;BigMac&quot; before  
upgrading.
