It wouldn't do that unless the only messages from your address that  
you trained it with were spam.

</I>&gt;<i> Nope.  They are clearly an odd sort of e-mail message to attack anti-

I'm not convinced, but if you'd like to send me one (saved as Raw  
Message Source and then attached to an e-mail) I'd be interested to  
see an example of one of these.

&gt;<i> My experience hasn't been the same.  I've had some clients report

Well, all I can say is that not many people report to me that it's  
become less accurate, and that when they do we can almost always get  
it back up to the proper level of accuracy.

The most common causes of accuracy problems are probably (a) a change  
in the user's mail rules such that SpamSieve is no longer being  
applied to all of the incoming messages, (b) spam messages that made  
it into the inbox and that the user had deleted outright rather than  
training as spam, and (c) the user had setup and trained SpamSieve  
several years ago, and they're now receiving different types of spam  
and good messages.

There's usually a simple solution if they contact technical support.  
And, if not, I'd certainly like to hear about new types of spam  
messages.
