How can I put this...  You've got to be F***** kidding me!  You need 
a better graphics card for an Audio application?  Now I know I'm 
right, Apple is writing software such that you need to upgrade when 
you shouldn't need to.  That is just plain insane.  I can sort of 
understand the need to upgrade for Aperture, I can't see how any 
audio software needs better graphics, I can't imagine it needing to 
be much more graphically intensive than Peak 2 on an old 8500/180.

I did the graphics card upgrade for my G4/450 AGP, and it cost about 
$300.  I did it so I could use all the features of I think 10.3.  I 
should have saved the money and put it towards the G5 2x2 I'm running 
now, as I upgraded a few months later.

With the way I use a computer, and 2GB kits nearing the $100 mark, 
going from 5.5GB to a full 8GB is very tempting.  At the same time I 
can't help but think I should force myself to live in 5.5GB, and save 
the money towards an upgrade.  One of these days I'm going to want a 
new Mac Pro, probably about the time I upgrade from Adobe Creative 
Suite Premium to CS3 (or maybe CS4).  I'm doing some heavy Lightroom 
&amp; Photoshop CS work tonight, and typing this while I wait on the 
various steps.  So right now I'm wishing I'd already upgraded, but 
normally I'm just fine with the G5. :^)  I hope to get another year 
or two's use out of this system (and it's already 4.4 years old.

Zane
