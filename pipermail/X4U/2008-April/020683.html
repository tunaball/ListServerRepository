Looks like 128meg in System Profiler.

If that's correct, then that's probably the only realistic option as  
far as flashing is concerned - when I looked at the MacElite pages  
(the new name for the StrangeDogs boys) there seemed only to be this  
one particular card that worked optimally. Other cards were quirky -  
for instance a card with dual DVI out didn't work when connected to  
DVI monitors, but only when using VGA adaptors; other charismatic  
features were more problematic, IIRC. The 9800 Pro based on ATi's  
reference design &quot;just works&quot; - perfectly and the way you'd expect it  
to.

&gt;<i> I was lucky, mine started going out about a week prior to my Applecare
</I>&gt;<i> expiring.
</I>
My experiences with this G5 tempt me towards the full 3-year  
Applecare next time. I've always got it for laptops in the past, but  
working with PCs had led me to perceive towers as &quot;repairable&quot;. But  
the cost of Applecare makes a MacPro seem even less affordable. : 
(  It seems like plumbers &amp; builders can tell when the economy is on  
a downturn - all my customers are complaining of cashflow problems at  
the moment, and taking ages to pay their bills.

(Having said that, I just looked at the MacPro pages on Apple.com,  
and they're showing only a 1.6x or 2x performance increase against a  
G5 on many applications. Admittedly the G5 is a quad-core, but  
still... I guess I expected more, somehow. Maybe this'll make waiting  
to afford an upgrade less frustrating.)

Stroller.
