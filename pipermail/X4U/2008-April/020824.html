Frozen in *MY* context means waiting for a resource that will never  
be available. i.e. waiting on an read (or write) to a disk that was  
powered off (as an example). Yes I did get a spinning beach ball as  
you call it but to me that just means the application is not  
responding (for what ever reason). I was able to Force quit ICAL.  
There could be many different reasons for a spinning beachball  
(AFAIK) only Apple can tell you all the reasons. I would think you  
would have to know quite a bit of how interrupts are handle by the OS  
to even begin to guess what causes them. That, plus how dispatching  
is done by the OS.  I know that Apples is simple (compared to others)  
but not well documented (on purpose?). Other OS's (that I am familiar  
with) have clear concise documentation on dispatching and interrupts  
and &quot;other&quot; events that change the state of the OS. I guess that  
comes with maturity of the OS (in this context over 10 years) as  
people need to know (sometimes) that type of detail.
