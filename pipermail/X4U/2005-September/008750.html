<PRE>After about on hour of troubleshooting (repairing permissions, 
disconnecting peripherals, etc.) I have come up with nothing.  I booted 
from the TechTools CD, set the tests to run, and went to bed.

This morning, I checked the iMac, and found that it was asleep.  When I 
tried to wake it up, I got another screen with the rainbow lines.  The 
hard-drive did spin to indicate that it had woken up, but I couldn't 
get rid of the lines, and ended up having to cut the power once again.

I tried to reboot, and didn't get the standard chime, but instead a 
longer higher pitched tone and a blank screen (dark grey or black, it 
was hard to tell).  The hard-drive was spinning, but once again I was 
stuck.

I was forced to cut power and reboot yet again, and this time the 
process went fine.  I have now set the machine to not sleep (computer 
and display) and for the moment, things are okay.

I am now convinced that there is a problem, I'm just not sure what it 
is. Any and all suggestions are very much appreciated.

Also, I need to back up.  I have been far too lax with this.  I have 
some clients files backed up on my iPod, but I would like to get an 
external hard-drive and/or DVD drive.  Are there any deals out there?  
Suggestions on the best back-up methods?

Thanks,

Samantha



&gt;<i> I don't want to jump the gun and assume that I have a problem 
</I>&gt;<i> but...this is the one machine that I cannot afford to have a problem 
</I>&gt;<i> with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When waking my iMac G4 (512 MB RAM, 1GHz, 10.3.9) from approximately 5 
</I>&gt;<i> hours of sleep, I was greeted with not only a frozen screen, but one 
</I>&gt;<i> with thin vertical rainbow pinstripes and one thicker black horizontal 
</I>&gt;<i> line. Key strokes were unable to resolve the problem, and I was 
</I>&gt;<i> eventually forced to cut the power, wait a few moments, and restart.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Restarting was unsuccessful, and I got to a grey screen with barely 
</I>&gt;<i> noticeable grey vertical pinstripes, and was unable to proceed.  Once 
</I>&gt;<i> again, I cut the power, restarted, and this time everything seemed 
</I>&gt;<i> fine.  I've verified permissions and all is good, but I can't help but 
</I>&gt;<i> worry that there is an underlying problem that I am missing. I could 
</I>&gt;<i> survive without my laptop, but I rely on my desktop for work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone heard of such a thing?  I have googled it rather 
</I>&gt;<i> unsuccessfully. What else should I check to ensure that all is okay?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks a bunch!
</I>&gt;<i>
