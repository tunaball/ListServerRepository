<PRE>Stroller said:

&gt;&gt;<i> yeah, i heard some people on this list mentioning this. this friend of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mine still wants to give it a try though&#214;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Don't let her turn it on again, then!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you find yourself having `rm -rf really important stuff`or emptied 
</I>&gt;<i>the trash of really valuable files, power the computer off IMMEDIATELY. 
</I>&gt;<i>Don't use shutdown, just pull the power lead out the back or (with a 
</I>&gt;<i>laptop) hold down the power button for 3 seconds until it hard-powers 
</I>&gt;<i>itself off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Send the disk straight to a data recovery expert. It'll cost you 
</I>&gt;<i>upwards of a hundred quid to recover the data, but there are 
</I>&gt;<i>specialists who won't charge you unless they do recover useful data 
</I>&gt;<i>files. Vogon have a branches in the US now, I believe, or if you're in 
</I>&gt;<i>the UK contact me for the details of a little bloke who seems to have 
</I>&gt;<i>quite a good reputation. It's worth noting also that data recovery 
</I>&gt;<i>specialists seem to have discovered sliding pricing scales, so if 
</I>&gt;<i>you're a private individual who doesn't mind if the data isn't 
</I>&gt;<i>recovered for a week then it'll cost you much less than if you're a 
</I>&gt;<i>corporate customer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Cue replies of &quot;ignore Stroller's advice - just recover from a backup&quot;
</I>
No, I agree completely.  That is exactly the best procedure to follow if 
the lost data is very important/valuable. (And I, for one, don't see the 
need to chide someone for not having a backup *after* they have already 
lost their data. Losing your data is bad enough without folks giving you 
a hard time for not being careful.) 

However, if the lost data isn't very valuable, and you just want to give 
recovery a try without having to pay a huge amount of money to a recovery 
service, you may want to try:

Prosoft's DataRescue ($99)
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.prosofteng.com/products/data_rescue_info.php?PHPSESSID=78ad9999">http://www.prosofteng.com/products/data_rescue_info.php?PHPSESSID=78ad9999</A>
56ef83a2f6e57cb0266397f5&gt; 

DataRescue is much more effective in instances where a drive just dies, 
but it may have some limited effectiveness in your situation.

If you need a referral to a data recovery service that won't charge 
outrageous fees, let me know.
