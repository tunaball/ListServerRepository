I'll keep this in mind since I'm happy back at 10.3.9 :^)  I do anticipate
needing to upgrade at some point in the future.

&gt;<i> Tiger release was one of the rockier ones.  Zane's security  
</I>&gt;<i> observations are legitimate as are the usefulness of widgets.   
</I>&gt;<i> Someday widgets may be really cool, in the meantime they're stupid.   
</I>&gt;<i> You may like em, but you use your mac differently than me.
</I>
The security issue really bothered me, as they *should* know better.

As for usefulness, to me they're totally useless, but if implemented such
that they were on the same desktop as all your other apps, then I could see
them being of use (though I also dislike how memory hungry they are).

&gt;<i> Grandma likes her imac and tiger, but her head would explode if she  
</I>&gt;<i> encountered one of the many bugs.  The good news for her is- most of  
</I>&gt;<i> the bugs are &quot;esoteric&quot;.  This sleep problem does not seem to impact  
</I>&gt;<i> imac's.
</I>
INTERESTING!  So is the sleep problem that everyone else is having like mine
(where after haveing been up for a certain amount of time it doesn't like to
go to sleep on its own)?  Or am I experiencing a different problem?  It
sounded like the original poster had a slightly different issue.

BTW, here is an interesting/irritating tip for people running 10.3.9.  If
you have multiple users logged in at once, having any of them with it set so
you need to give a password to wake up from sleep or clear the screensaver,
can cause major problems.  The problem we saw was my account was password
protected for wake/screensaver, and the second wasn't.  After waking the 
computer up and switching to the second user, the computer would go back to
sleep after about 30 seconds.  Once it was woken up again it would be fine. 
As far as I know this is fixed in 10.4.

		Zane
