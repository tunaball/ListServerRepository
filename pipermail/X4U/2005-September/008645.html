Your boss's logic seems flawed. He says that apple would install a  
1900x1200 screen if one was available. Obviously, one is available  
because Dell is using one.

I think Apple rightly used a somewhat lower resolution screen on  
thier 17&quot; PowerBook to maintain usability for the widest gamut of  
users. I have seen those 1900x1200 resolution on 17&quot; screens also,  
and they can be dificult to view. Same goes for their 15&quot; screens  
that use 1680x1050.

Generally Apple uses a 106 PPI resolution on their panels. It seems a  
good balance between usability and resolution

Just because one 'can' do something doesn't make that a good reason  
'to' do it.

Good luck,
