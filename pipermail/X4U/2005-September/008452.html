</I>&gt;<i> Hi Adrian:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the past 5 years I've gradually upgraded my wife's single  
</I>&gt;<i> processor 500Mhz Sawtooth (a rare beast) and she has been thrilled  
</I>&gt;<i> with the results.  It's a very robust platform that responds well to  
</I>&gt;<i> incremental improvements.  She's a graphic designer doing a lot of  
</I>&gt;<i> with with the complete Adobe suite.  The operating system has  
</I>&gt;<i> generally kept pace with Apple's upgrades from OS 8.6 through 9.x up  
</I>&gt;<i> through 10.3.9.  We haven't yet converted this machine to Tiger as  
</I>&gt;<i> she's been on production deadlines for the last 6 months...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First improvement:  More RAM.  The system has had 1.5GB since late  
</I>&gt;<i> 2000 and it is the single most valuable upgrade you can make.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second improvement:  Upgraded graphics adapter to ATI Radeon 8500  
</I>&gt;<i> AGP.  We did this while she was still running OS 9 and it made a huge  
</I>&gt;<i> difference in Photoshop performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Third improvement:  Upgraded the hard disk to 120GB IBM (Hitachi)  
</I>&gt;<i> 7200RPM Deskstar.  The extra space was absolutely required, the extra  
</I>&gt;<i> speed was not really noticeable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fourth improvement:  Upgraded to an original Apple dual 500Mhz  
</I>&gt;<i> processor.  We did this around the same time as installing OS 10.2  
</I>&gt;<i> (we never ran Puma on this machine), and without a doubt dual  
</I>&gt;<i> processors make OS 10 run SO much better than a uniprocessor.  It was  
</I>&gt;<i> certainly faster than the 800Mhz uniprocessor TiPBG4 that I was using  
</I>&gt;<i> as my daily machine at this time running Jaguar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fifth improvement:  Upgraded to PowerLogix dual 1GHz processor in  
</I>&gt;<i> late 2004.  I found this for a good price as a discontinued model at  
</I>&gt;<i> OtherWorldComputing (OWC).  We're still using this configuration  
</I>&gt;<i> today, and its performance is so good that we have no interest in  
</I>&gt;<i> upgrading to a G5 anytime soon.  The performance running OS 10.3 is  
</I>&gt;<i> noticeably better than my current machine, a 1.2GHz uniprocessor  
</I>&gt;<i> iBook G4.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Planned sixth improvement:  If all goes well, over the weekend I'm  
</I>&gt;<i> going to install SoftRaid and put a second 120GB Deskstar in the  
</I>&gt;<i> system as a mirrored drive.  We've actually had it installed for a  
</I>&gt;<i> while as a clone drive for backups, but that's suboptimal for our  
</I>&gt;<i> application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I expect that this will be the last upgrade for this workhorse of a  
</I>&gt;<i> system, unless I can find a screaming deal on a &gt;1.7GHz dual G4  
</I>&gt;<i> processor module.  In most cases I've successfully eBayed the  
</I>&gt;<i> replaced component to defray the costs of the upgrade, so my total  
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade investment over the past 5 years has been &lt; $1000.  Hope this  
</I>&gt;<i> insight helps you with your decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jim
</I>
Thanks Jim. 

I have 768 Megs of Ram... I'll check out prices,,, and a 9200 AGP card 
via Ebay is on the way.  Jury is still out on the lower g multi vs the 
much higer g Single processor.  

Panther can indeed be had cheap so that'll be next.
