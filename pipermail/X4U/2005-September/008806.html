&gt;&gt;<i> I have to disagree. Here's how Prosoft describes Data Rescue:

</I>&gt;<i>Did you see that I pasted that exact blurb into my post? All of it points to
</I>&gt;<i>using DataRescue to recover files from a problem hard drives. Not one bit
</I>&gt;<i>says anything about undeleting Trashed files.
</I>

FWIW, a user in my local computer group trashed a bunch of files by 
mistake and he desperately needed to get them back.  Several folks 
recommended that he not do anything else with his computer until after he 
tried to undelete the files, and that he try DataRescue.

DataRescue didn't help.  At first it seemed as if he was able to get a 
bunch of his files back, but they were all fragments and unuseable.  

Apparently under OS X either trashed files are overwritten a lot sooner 
than they were under OS 9, or, once files are trashed, there isn't enough 
information left on the drive to accurately recover them without a 
third-party undelete utility already installed.
