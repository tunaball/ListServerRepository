</I>&gt;<i> waking the
</I>&gt;<i> computer up and switching to the second user, the computer would go  
</I>&gt;<i> back to
</I>&gt;<i> sleep after about 30 seconds.  Once it was woken up again it would  
</I>&gt;<i> be fine.
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know this is fixed in 10.4.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Zane
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>There seems to be an interesting time problem in 10.4.  For some  
people after two hours (from bootup) their computer freezes when they  
mess with anything full screen quicktime.  For others, after two  
hours their USB and Firewire conks out.  Others still, after 2 hours,  
computer no sleepy.  Near as I can tell, they all have this two hour  
or so &quot;time fuse&quot;.  After that time all hell breaks loose.  It seems  
confined to G5 towers, but particularly the SP 1.8Ghz G5.  I've seen  
sporadic reports on imac g5's, which is surprising considering the SP  
1.8Ghz G5 tower mobo is nearly identical to the imac G5.  The apple  
discussion board has a report of a user claiming the apple care babe  
said &quot;apple is aware of the problem and is working on the fix&quot;.  
(how's that for 5th hand info?)

Meantime, if you're running a DV-camera directly from iMovieHD and  
iMovieHD likes to crash on you, don't use the cameral control  
softkey's on iMovieHD's screen.  Switch to the native camera controls  
and the crashes will end.  There is a Firewire timing problem.

And if you want to use Tigers FAX capability- just don't.
