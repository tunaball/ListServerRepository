<PRE>I recently migrated from an iBook to a Powerbook. I used the Migration
Assistant and for the most part have been overwhelmingly pleased with
that utility. Everything copied over and has worked pretty much as it
did on the iBook, except for one thing, and that is bugging me.

I can not search mail before the migration. All of the messages are
there, but search doesn't look in them. I have archives going back a
few years and have always been able to rely on the mail search
feature.

I couldn't find anything in the help files that referenced this. The
closest I found said to sync the mailboxes, I tried it, but nothing
happened that I could tell. I see the rebuild menu option and have
been tempted to do that.

Does anyone have any ideas?

Machine specs:
15&quot; Powerbook, 10.4.2, 1.5GHz, 1.5GB

Gore was effectively marginalized by a party without a conscience and
kept press, they're going to be amazed that any of us had opposable
thumbs.
