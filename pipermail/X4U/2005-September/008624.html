Virus Barrier is a pretty impressive program, isn't it?

But before the other folks on this list start flaming me for scaring 
folks into purchasing anti-virus software that they don't need, let me 
once again restate my position:

I don't think that most Mac users need anti-virus software.  There are no 
OS X-specific viruses, and though there is some OS X malware out there, 
all of it is either easily handled without having to resort to AV 
software, or it is incredbily rare.

I use AV software myself because it is vitally important that my client 
files not be exposed to any sort of risk whatsoever, but not many other 
folks are in that position.  (I also use a UPS and multiple hard drives.  
I think that these have their advantages too, but not everyone needs 
these things either.)

So please don't think that I am advocating that you purchase AV software. 
 You probably don't need it.
