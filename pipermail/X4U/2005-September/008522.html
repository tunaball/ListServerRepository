&gt;<i>So.. don't be too harsh on CR, but it would be nice to see them print the
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;facts&quot; in addition to the horse hockey that people report.
</I>

It would also be nice to seem them print some user feedback and 
manufacturer feedback.  Note that there is no &quot;letters&quot; section in CR, 
and no provision for manufacturer feedback, or followups to correct 
misinformation.  This is CR's biggest problem; they don't take into 
account any third-party information or input and they don't correct 
incorrect impressions.  

I've purchased products that CR has recommended, and they have turned out 
to be garbage.  (Sometimes CR's error was that they probably didn't test 
the products for as long as I had, other times it was because they were 
looking at the wrong things.)  Could I write to CR and relate my 
experience with those products and warn others not to purchase those 
products?  No.  Could anyone else write in to CR to warn me about other 
products that CR made a mistake in recommending? No.
