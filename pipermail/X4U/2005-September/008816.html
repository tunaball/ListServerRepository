Well, you posted that your files were all recovered upon restart, correct?

So I assume that you aren't asking me how to recover your files.  Are you 
asking me how to protect your files from accidental trashing in the 
future, or how to recover files that have already been trashed, if it 
ever happens to you?

One very simple thing that you can do is to create a folder on the 
desktop called something like &quot;pre-Trash&quot; and use it instead of your 
trashcan.  After things have dwelled there for a good amount of time, and 
you are sure that you don't need them, you can trash them.

As for tools that will allow you to make it possible to undelete files in 
advance, I note that Prosoft has discontinued the Data Safety Suite and 
Data Recycler X, and that Symantec has discontinued Norton Utilities for 
the Mac.  I don't know if TechTool Pro can do this.  But I don't 
particularly trust TechTool Pro.  

It seems to me that the best course is to try and make sure that you 
don't accidentally trash things rather than to try and undelete them 
later.
