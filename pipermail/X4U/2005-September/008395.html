I've got an original G4/450 AGP (it is so old it was one of the few 
that came with Mac OS 8.6/G4), I can't do DP on it.  This was part of 
why I upgraded to a new system.

You're running Mac OS X, you'll benefit at least some as long as 
you're doing more than one thing at once.  Plus I believe some of the 
basic iLife apps can use multiple CPU's, I know Photoshop can.  I'm a 
strong believer in 2+ CPU's in a system, but that's because of how I 
use my systems (quite often I have one or more things running in the 
background).

I can't wait to see what Apple can do with some of the new Intel 
CPU's once they make the changeover!

</I>
Interesting point.  That adds $130 value to it.  You still need to 
think about RAM and whatever you might have internal on the Sawtooth. 
OTOH, you the smaller size of the Mini might have value.

</I>
Is it the OS, or the apps that feel slow?  On my system with 10.2 it 
didn't feel fast, but it didn't feel slower either.  What amazed me 
was how fast Safari was.
