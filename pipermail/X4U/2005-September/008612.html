I sort of started this sub-thread, in an oblique way, and I just 
downloaded the program Randy suggested, Virus Barrier X&#174;.
Might as well be as free from critters as I can _before_ I install a new 
version of MS Office 2004. Fence the pasture before you let the new 
horses out!

I did a scan of my H.D. first thing after installing it, and the enture 
scan took only a few minutes, so it's fast too! A good selling point.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I've found that the &quot;no viruses&quot; angle doesn't actually motivate a lot of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Windows users to want to switch.  Geeky Windows users don't really 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>consider viruses to be a big problem.  They just keep their computers 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>updated with the latest anti-viral software and patches and they are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>pretty safe.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Unsophistocated users of Windows are afraid of viruses, but I suspect 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that they would be afraid of switching to a whole new computer even more.
</I>

&gt;<i> Things like this just amaze me, and don't doubt it in the least, especially
</I>&gt;<i> after the subject of viruses came up a few weeks ago when talking to a kid
</I>&gt;<i> we hired recently.  He doesn't even run anti-virus software on windows, he
</I>&gt;<i> just reloads his system every couple weeks (that totally boggles my mind).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I stated in a thread here recently, one of my primary considerations in a
</I>&gt;<i> platform is security.  Data kept on a computer that is susceptable to
</I>&gt;<i> viruses isn't safe.  Furthermore, I don't have time to deal with fighting
</I>&gt;<i> the problem.  That's one of the main reasons I still use a Mac.  The other
</I>&gt;<i> being applications availability and my investment in applications.  Of
</I>&gt;<i> course I also feel Mac OS X tends to be more secure that some &quot;secure&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives such as Linux, but that it isn't secure enough.
