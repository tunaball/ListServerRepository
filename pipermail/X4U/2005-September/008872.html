<PRE>I needed to add a printer to my iBook (10.4.2, 1.3 GHz, 1.25GB). The  
printer was connected to my XP computer at work. It is an HP 4100 dtn  
that is currently bereft of its internal jet direct card. I have it  
connected locally to my XP computer via the parallel port. There are  
other network printers in the building, but this was the only duplex  
one and I needed to add it.

I found a hint on macosxhints.com, but for the life of me can't find  
the actual doc at the moment. It worked, and I was able to print my  
docs that day. It involved turning on printer sharing, aliasing cupsd  
(i think) in the Terminal window and using the CUPS gui interface  
through my browser. I defined a printer, used the FQDN for my XP  
machine in the URI and a few minutes later I was printing.

The problem now is that all of my printers are hosed and I can't use  
any of them. They might work once I get back on my corporate LAN, the  
ones in the building at any rate. All told I have about a dozen  
installed for use at work, home and school. When I look at the  
printer utility window I see the host defined for all the printers. I  
don't remember ever seeing the host defined in that window before. I  
cross referenced my B&amp;W tower (10.3.9, 500MHz, 1GB) and my wife's  
iBook (10.4.2, 700MHz, 648MB) and neither of those have anything in  
the host field in the printer utility window. The problem, as near as  
I can tell is the host name:  hspc157449.px.snds.com. I know what the  
domain suffix is, that's the domain suffix for my corporate LAN. I  
don't know what the hspc157449 name is exactly, but I think it has  
something to do with our DNS server, a Lucent QIP server. When I  
configure addresses in the QIP tool I often see something similar  
before a host name is defined for an address. I know that it is not  
the name of my XP machine, that's AB868703, and not the Samba name  
for my iBook, that's Loki.

I&quot;ve looked in cupsd.conf, client.conf and printers.conf and  
hostconfig and can't find any traces of the hspc host name. I've  
deleted and readded my home printer, connected to an external jet  
direct print server, but the song, err, host remained the same. I've  
looked at the help files for the print setup utility and it would  
only say that the host field &quot;displays the name of the computer  
that's &quot;hosting&quot; or sharing the printer.&quot;

I'm at wits end. Does anyone have any suggestions. At this point I am  
perfectly happy wiping out all of the defined printers and re-adding  
them as need arises. Any help would be appreciated.
