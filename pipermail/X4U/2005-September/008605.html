Years ago, I'd read that changes to the OS made writing viruses far more
difficult.  I'm not sure where I read this, it was likely in some developer
material.

Thanks, I've made it through the first page so far, it's interesting.

BTW, it might be worth noting that I've used a Mac for ~14 years, and owned
one for 10 years (purchased to run ClarisDraw and because of Windows 95). 
I've used and owned PC's for about 18 years, and have owned computers for
~24 years.  I've even worked with computers full time for the last 15 years
(and part time for 3 1/2 before that).  In all that time I've seen 2
viruses, one was on a PC floppy that someone I supported came up with (I
actaully had to clean it up using my personal laptop, as that was the only
thing with Antivirus software, this was about 10 years ago).  The other time
was 3-4 years ago when my wife managed to get one by surfing the Internet on
a WinME laptop.  I wouldn't consider running a computer with a MS OS on it
without anti-virus software and anti-spyware software on it (I've run
Anti-Virus software on them for the last 15 years).
