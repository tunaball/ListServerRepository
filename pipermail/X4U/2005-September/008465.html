It depends what services your provider supports.

You have long been able to get slow dial-up access using a mobile 
phone, but the current generation is GPRS &amp; 3G services which are 
faster and which are charged by volume of data, not by &quot;time online&quot;. I 
don't know exactly how much I pay for these sorts of services - I use 
them very little at present - but a UK provider Vodafone recently 
quoted me &quot;about &#163;3 per megabyte&quot; when I enquired on behalf of a 
customer this week. Better tariffs are available for volume users.

A friend recently bought a 3G mobile &amp; claims speeds of 100k/s or 
200k/s - comparable to broadband - but coverage for these services is 
(in the UK, at least) extremely patchy, so devices typically fall back 
to GPRS (at c 48kbps or speeds approaching old-fangled landline 
dial-up).

You can access these services using some models of PCMCIA card 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/07/vodafone_3g_mac/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/07/vodafone_3g_mac/</A>&gt; but also 
through most modern mobile phones. Once a bluetooth pairing has been 
made between the devices, the phone should offer internet connection as 
a &quot;service&quot; to the laptop. I have to say I haven't achieved this with a 
Mac myself, and if this is important to you I'd suggest you be 
extremely careful about buying a new mobile phone until you're sure 
it'll work - I'd imagine that a posting to uk.comp.sys.mac might be 
informative, as I think this sort of usage is more common in the UK 
than the USA.

Stroller.
