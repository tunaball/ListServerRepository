In the past 7 years?  It found one classic virus maybe within that time 
period.  In that time it flagged at least a couple of Word macro viruses. 
 And it has flagged a bunch of Windows viruses that have shown up as 
e-mail attachments.  

&gt;<i>Selling a product that portends to find something that doesn't exist 
</I>&gt;<i>is snake oil in my book.
</I>
Which Mac malware is it that you don't think exists?  Microsoft macro 
viruses? (Of which there are literally thousands, by the way.)  The two 
or three Trojans/worms that all of the AV reporting sites list, and which 
have been well documented on Macintosh, MacFixIt and on the Apple 
discussion site?  Classic viruses? 

I can easily understand it when folks say that AV software isn't 
necessary for OS X users.  I say the same thing myself.  There is no 
question that malware that attacks some portion of OS X (which includes 
Classic) is very rare.  

What I don't understand is why some people try so hard to insist that no 
malware exists for OS X at all, when it clearly does.  (All that you have 
to do is do a Google search, or look at Macintouch's archives, to see 
that it does.) I've heard folks go so far as to say that there is a 
massive conspiracy among the AV software developers to fabricate the 
existence of malware for OS X.  I've even been told that if I believed 
that there was any malware for OS X that I must be on the take.  (Which 
is news to me and my bank account.)

Come on...
