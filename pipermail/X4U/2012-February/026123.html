</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The problem is that I can't move files between machines without

</I>&gt;<i>I can't fix this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>When I set permissions on a file on one machine to everyone, staff,

</I>&gt;<i>intermediary, a &quot;custom&quot; permission is created. This I can change as 
</I>&gt;<i>an ordinary user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But those damn custom permissions repeatedly pop up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There is also a real weird problem: If I am on the Lion Mac, with 
</I>&gt;<i>the MB networked, and move a file to the MB, the file will 
</I>&gt;<i>apparently move but it will be zero length. Still on Lion, I 
</I>&gt;<i>seemingly can delete the zero length file on the MB. But when I 
</I>&gt;<i>repeat the file move, I am told the file already exists on the MB, 
</I>&gt;<i>do I want to replace it or keep both copies. Either way, it silently 
</I>&gt;<i>will copy multiple copies of the file - all zero length - to the MB. 
</I>&gt;<i>When I caught the problem, it had created over 40,000 empty copies! 
</I>&gt;<i>Not funny - it takes a finite time to delete all those copies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The bottom line is that sitting on the Lion Mini, I can't copy a 
</I>&gt;<i>file to the networked MB, and dragging a file from the remote MB 
</I>&gt;<i>will require an administrator's password but still won't work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Sitting at the MB, I can't connect because none of my passwords work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>B. L., this all used to be seamless (Before Lion). I had no problems 
</I>&gt;<i>between two Snow Leopard machines. Lion screwed it up!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I installed the latest dot release of Lion - it was supposed to 
</I>&gt;<i>improve Windows networking, but no joy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Repairing permissions found &amp; fixed some system files, but nothing 
</I>&gt;<i>that looked relevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Any guidance on Snow Leopard &amp; Lion on the same network?
</I>
Today I've just got my first Lion host on my network, replacing my 
wife's 12&quot; iBook with a new 13&quot; MBP. When moving files from the old 
to the new that Migration Assistant didn't copy it worked just like 
I'm used to between any other two OS X Macs.

When you connect to the other Mac, if you do so as the user that owns 
the files and folders you want to access, there should be no problem. 
Copying a file across and getting an empty file means that the 
destination folder is writable by the user doing it, so the file is 
created, but the file gets permissions that don't allow the user to 
write the contents into it. We need to know more to diagnose the 
problem. Have you made any changes to try to help the situation?
