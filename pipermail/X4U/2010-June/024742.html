I have a couple of spare Seagate Momentus 500GB drives running at 7200 RPM. Any problem with replacing the bad one with a 7200 RPM drive, or do both need to be the same speed of drive? Or, should I pull the good Hitachi drive too, and replace both with the Seagates?

Hmmmm . . . I've replaced the Hitachi drive in the &quot;upper&quot; bay that Disk Utility is telling has failed for the mirrored RAID set, with a Seagate Momentus 500GB 7200 RPM drive, and now Disk Utility is telling me that the Seagate has failed in the mirrored set. I completely erased both internal drives (the Hitachi that I thought was still OK) and the new Seagate I swapped in, built a brand new mirrored RAID set, and then used Disk Utility to restore from a cloned backup. It appears that whatever drive I put in the &quot;upper&quot; bay in the Mac mini is failing. Actually, I think the drives are OK, its something with the upper bay, because I reformatted the Hitachi I thought was bad in an external enclosure and just copied several gigabytes worth of movies from my MacBook and it worked fine. 

I'm wondering if I need to take it back to the dealer I bought it from and setup a temporary server in its absence. It still has 6 months warranty left on the 1st year. We recently had some very severe thunderstorms and I'm wondering if a surge didn't do something to the drive circuitry. The server and our network routers are all together and protected with an APC UPS - so I would think that with the extra surge protection and battery backup, it'd be fairly well protected.
