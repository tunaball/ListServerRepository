<PRE>Cheryl;
	I'm going to try to answer your question inline.

	In addition to my answers below.  Unless there have been other problems; I would wager on a dead/discharged battery, make sure of connection, &amp; power;  and then plug it up for a couple of minutes and try to start it.
	Unless there is major trouble with the MacBook; it should start up even without a battery in it ,if it is connected to a power-supply.

&gt;<i> Hi all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a friend who has a Macbook that she got three years ago; the Apple Care just ran out last week. Suddenly this morning it wouldn't work for her; she's blind so I've asked her to get a sighted person to look and see if there's any indication of life at all. Since I have never owned a Macbook and am trying to troubleshoot for her, I have the following questions (sorry if these sound stupid but I'm trying to cover all the bases):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If somehow her battery had been allowed to run down completely, would the computer still work immediately when plugged in?     NO; it would take a minute or so.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If the battery was completely dead and needed replacing, would the computer still continue to work when plugged in?                   Yes; but it would need a moment to realize a power-supply was plugged in.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Could we test whether the problem is the hard drive by putting a Mac cd/dvd in and turning on the computer while holding down the C button? If it was the hard drive, wouldn't we still be able to boot up the cd?  YES.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Can anybody think of anything else obvious that I should have her check? She seems to indicate that when she pushes the button to turn on the computer, absolutely nothing happens--meaning there's no sound of starting up at all. If there's something else obvious we should check before trying to get a repair estimate, I'd like to know about it. She lives in a rural area and it's going to be a pain to take it in plus, probably like most of us, a new computer or a computer repair without Apple Care, isn't really in the budget, though now I guess it may have to be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any troubleshooting help anybody can give me.
