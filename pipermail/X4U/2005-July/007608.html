Maybe I am underestimating, but not having done it (installed

</I>
As much as I don't want to believe that, I do. It's a sad state of  
affairs.

&gt;<i> Installing Windows XP can easily take a couple of hours, especially

</I>&gt;<i> 256meg or less of RAM - and that's not counting Office, Service  
</I>&gt;<i> Pack 2, internet setup, accounts for the kids &amp;c &amp;c.
</I>
But all of that (except probably SP2) would have to be done with a  
new PC too, wouldn't it?

&gt;<i> If I can take the computer home &amp; leave it running - I back-up the  
</I>&gt;<i> whole hard-drive and install any additional software in addition to  
</I>&gt;<i> the above -
</I>
And what I couldn't believe is that the first person in the article  
(with a Ph.D. in compsci) didn't have a clean image backed up  
somewhere he could restore instead of buying a whole new computer.  
Which he's going to have to do again in 6 months unless he's going to  
be running a different OS or doing things different than he has been.

&gt;<i> There are so many factors that come into this, it hard to surmise,  
</I>&gt;<i> but for machines of more than 2 years old replacement may not be a  
</I>&gt;<i> bad upgrade.
</I>
Like I said, if there are other reasons involved (wanting a faster  
computer), I can understand perfectly. My guess is that many of the  
people interviewed wanted a new PC for whatever reason, and the  
malware was just an excuse they could hang the blame on. But that  
wouldn't make the story quite as interesting. Purely MO.
