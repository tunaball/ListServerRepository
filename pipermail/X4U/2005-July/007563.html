You're quite right.  FileMaker by its very nature should be slower.   
It's a compiled vs interpreted kind of thing.  The comparison,  
however, was to illustrate the difference between raw performance  
(what the machine is capable of) vs the apparent performance of the  
machine when using FileMaker.

&gt;<i> I suggest a better test would involve activities typical of the  
</I>&gt;<i> business application of the software. Say, create 20,000 invoice  
</I>&gt;<i> records, modify each of them, then delete them all one by one. Run  
</I>&gt;<i> this on the target systems and see how you do.
</I>
No why would I want to do that, the point was only to show that you  
shouldn't judge your machine by the measure of a single application.   
FileMaker is a fine program I've even considered using it my self.   
I'm not trying to come of as an arrogant C programer.  I don't think  
that the solution to everything is to write a custom C application.   
On the contrary, you shouldn't build something yourself if it's  
already available to you.  Even Apple has embraced this concept with  
its use of open source software.

Now that being said, FileMaker took 19 seconds to &quot;count&quot; to 20,000  
and my C program took 0.000544 seconds, that means FileMaker is about  
34,926 times slower at &quot;counting&quot; than the machine is capable of.   
All I'm saying is that's interesting and by my book quite slow.  
Please don't read any further into it than that.
