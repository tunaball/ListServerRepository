I had already tried DiskWarrior. But, I went out and bought a Lacie  
Drive the same size as the internal. I tried backing everything up  
with CCC. I had to skip some invisible file in the Library and then  
it choked on another invisible file called lost + found (how ironic).  
Anyway, I decided to do an Archive &amp; Install onto the Lacie first as  
a test. Worked just fine. After running the updates and repairing  
permissions I cloned back to the internal. Everything seems to work.  
I had to reinstall some apps like Final Cut Pro, but all in all, it  
seems to be OK. And now I have a backup on the Lacie which I will  
regularly update.

Thanks again for the input guys,
Daniel
