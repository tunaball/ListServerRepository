<PRE>Just got Tiger...Very coooool.

BUT: I'm having a whole lotta cryin and a-whinin over getting my  
preferences and quite a few other things remaining in my previous  
folders that I don't know how to transfer.

For example, I can't seem to get to my previous mail---I found the  
folder with users in it and added it to Tiger mail folder---but how  
do I get my rules, sigs, etc. to the new App?

For address book I found a text tab delimited copy of my previous  
cars, but can't seem to make it useful in any way--with the Tiger  
address book.

Am I misusing Help? Been pecking about in Tiger info online from  
Apple...but not finding stuff with apparently inept phrases....I'm  
beginning to think I may have to PAY someone to get all my stuff up  
and functioning so I can WORK again!

I didn't have a regular install...there were bugs...so a great guy at  
the apple store sorted out the things that were corrupted. (Here I  
thought I'd kept everything fine with my constant maintenance  
schedule, but apparently that doesn't do it! Should I throw away Disk  
Warrior?And apparently not all the First Aid in the world from  
keeping a bad ole womin like me with a nice, tidy hard drive.

Waaaaa.......(a slow rising higher and higher wail)

Leaving me with a clean install and a massive number of prefs and  
programs and ever so much more to be transferred over--and given life  
once again.

BUT I'M DOING SOMETHING VERY WRONG! CAN'T FIND WHAT I NEED IN  
HELP!!!!!! Or at Apple.

Helpless in St. Lou

The &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; with a burnt-out brain and 1% progress after 24  
hours with Tiger ...sniff....even tho I AM liking it...z
