Some of the earlier PowerPC Macs would not provide a video signal if  
the PRAM battery was too low, ie: PM6100, PM7100, and PM8100 if I  
recall correctly. They would give a green power button light, but no  
video signal at startup with a low battery.

After waiting a few seconds (perhaps 20 to 30), the video signal could  
be restored by pressing the power button long enough to initiate the  
restart procedure. This temporary wait would allow the battery to take  
a surface charge which would usually be enough to excite the video  
circuit and provide the full video image.

Is that a &quot;minor inconvenience&quot; or a significant delay in starting  
your computer? Something to be decided by each individual user, I think.

You would not believe the number of local school teachers who simply  
could not begin to understand why they were having no video at  
startup. I would explain that it was the surest indication that the  
battery needed to be replaced, but they would insist that the computer  
was working properly, just no video at startup.

When I demonstrated the procedure and then changed the battery for a  
good one, they usually asked why Apple didn't just make the &quot;low  
battery&quot; dialogue window appear when the computer was turned on. I  
guess that they couldn't make the connection between a low battery, no  
video signal, and not being able to show a dialogue window on screen.

These people were teaching our kids?
