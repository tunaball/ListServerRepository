Just a personal observation on portable MACS. I have several friends  
that have macbooks and the two biggest complaints I have heard from  
this are lack of disk space and memory (not enough of). I personally  
would steer him clear of the airport .

One of the friends is really upset as IIRC the max is 32G so he has  
to strip down his computer. He decided to get another so he could put  
Photshop and some big apps and the other he is leaving striped down  
for everything else. He has to carry two different computers with him  
as a result. The airport security people are *NOT* amused.

I know there are size considerations when it comes to portable  
computers but memory and drive space are really key issues. I also  
have friends in the PC world that don't have these issues with either  
memory or disk space. The most bitching I hear from them are issues  
on connectivity wireless and security.

Of course my friends that have Macbooks are carrying external drives  
around with them, another airport security gotcha. I have been told  
some of the security guards are brain dead types. Its better in  
Europe (from what I was told). I have a friend that literally travels  
the world Europe/India/China/Singapore/Etc and he never gets hassled  
just a glance (is what he tells me).  I told him to steer clear of  
the AIRBOOK and I saved him as one of fellow travelers got his  
airbook wrecked by the security people.

These people fly business class all over the world and they do tend  
to get nicer treatment when it comes to security, but you almost have  
to know them by name to get almost no problems.
