I encounter a surprising number of users who will not be dissuaded in  
their blind belief that:

1. Apple is infallible
2. Their Macintosh never needs any type of maintenance, ever
3. If their Macintosh would benefit from the use of any type of  
utility software, Apple would have provided it with their Macintosh  
(e.g. they refuse to believe that there is ever any need for Disk  
Warrior, or, under OS 8/9 when there were a number of Mac viruses,  
they refused to believe that using Disinfectant might be a good idea. )

So, the fact that you encountered folks who couldn't believe that  
after a bunch of years that their Macs needed to have an inexpensive  
internal battery replaced, is not at all surprising.
