trying to keep it short and quick.
The company that he works for (named deleted to protect my friends)  
they can order just about anything they want (as I mentioned the  
airbook). They weren't really Macintosh type people (and they got  
what was suggested to them by their in house IT people). From what I  
was told the windows people have better memory limits and larger HD's  
than do macintosh. Trying to get them off a windows centric  
organization was a battle and a half. I think (as it was told to me)  
that these people who travel the world are big muckety mucks and they  
get what they want. The problem is that their IT staff is semi  
sabotaging the the practice of getting macintosh's. If my friend had  
sat down with either a friend of mine or myself we might have  
suggested a PRO. I have vaguely heard that the Pro still has memory  
limitations and I would have to check with friends that are experts  
in this area. But the airbook is so limited as to what it can do a  
person that is a power user probably wouldn't get past 2nd base with  
the &quot;thing&quot;. Its nice to have a slim shinning &quot;thing&quot; to wow the  
people but if can't do the job then why carry it? In other words all  
show and no action.
