<PRE>So I&#185;ve got a fairly complicated printer setup to do and I don&#185;t have all
the details yet but this is what I do have so far.

We&#185;ve just got several new printer multi function copiers Toshiba eStudio
451c which copy, fax, etc...and most importantly scan documents and
instantly make PDFs and send them directly to a Windows 2003 share via SMB
or directly to our Macs. This is good but printing from our Macs to these
machines is sounding like it&#185;s going to be a total nightmare.

First off here at the university we&#185;re very very paranoid and security
conscious. So the printers are being moved to an internal private IP network
through a Windows 2003 server. What I&#185;ve been told is the printers will be
on that network and access to the rest of the world will be done through a
second non-private IP network. What I&#185;ve been told is this is accomplished
on the Windows side by the machine having two different IP addresses at the
same time. So the computer has one foot in one network and one foot in the
other. I&#185;m also told this concept came out of the UNIX community and was
ported over to the Windows world.  This is the first I&#185;ve heard of this. Now
for our Macs to be able to print and access the outside world simultaneously
we need to pull off this same trick. Does anybody know anything about this
and how this would be done on a Mac? Would this have to be done through the
command line or is there a GUI or??? I am clueless any info at all would be
a helpful place to start.

Second is accessing the printers through a Windows 2003 print server. I&#185;ve
been to the Apple site and it says this is possible but for whatever reason
nothing is showing up in the Printer Setup Utility in the Windows Print
Server tab. The dual IP thing is still not setup so this is &#179;normal&#178; Windows
printing. Bonjour does not work with this printer even though it is supposed
to. In the long run Bonjour will be disabled anyway as an option for us for
security and policy reasons. Does anybody have any experience printing in a
mixed environment like this? This is extremely frustrating. Also does
anybody know in general what a print server does and why we need one? I&#185;m
trying to wrap my head around what the print server does and how it does it?

I&#185;m on a Intel iMac updated to 10.4.7 I&#185;ve installed the Toshiba drivers and
software. The Toshiba website is dreadfully lacking in info and the Mac guy
for Toshiba is in Toronto and not readily available, the people that we&#185;re
leasing the copiers from have not returned our emails or calls.  The Mac
guru that I usually go to, to ask such questions is on vacation for two
weeks starting today. Suffice to say this totally sucks and to my mind is
unacceptable business practice, but I digress, this leaves me as the sole
person at this time in charge of figuring out and making the printers work.

Any help at all would be helpful in navigating a way through this quagmire

Thank you 

Richard
