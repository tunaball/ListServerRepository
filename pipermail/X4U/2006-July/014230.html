[CONTINUED]

...The other feature I really like about Aperture is that it handles  
dual-monitors really well, and I live dual-monitors. Unfortunately  
Aperture is also a resource hog and runs really PAINFULLY slowly on  
my DP 1.8 G5. This is actually nothing to do with the processors,  
which are almost idle most of the time I'm using Aperture, but the  
ATI Radeon 9600 XT graphics card. I thought this was an adequate  
graphics card when I bought my Mac, as it's good enough to play Doom  
3 at acceptable frame-rates, but Aperture really HAMMERS the graphics  
card. I'm reluctant to spend &#163;125 - &#163;300 on a new card for this  
machine (&#163;125 would get quite a decent StangeDogs-hacked PC graphics  
card, I think) and Aperture could be the driving force compelling me  
to upgrade to the Intel PowerMacs when they're released.

RAM makes quite a difference with Lightroom, which was what caused me  
to to upgrade from 1.25gig to 3gig. Not sure how this might've  
affected Aperture because I really didn't use it at the time. But I  
think that without it Lightroom was performing better than Aperture  
as far as things like speed of straightening are concerned. My  
workflow mostly consists of straighten, crop, set white-balance  
point, do some exposure &amp; saturation adjustments; Lightroom is  
probably quite a little chunk faster at these, and I don't think  
Aperture's stacks manage to compensate in time-saving; I hope that a  
new graphics card would allow me to race through my &quot;workflow&quot; with  
Aperture, which is presently a little frustrating.

The great thing about Lightroom is that the Beta is free, so you can  
download it &amp; try it for yourself.

&gt;<i> Anything else I forgot to consider?
</I>
Complicated subject, as I'm sure you realised. I hope that my answers  
have given _some_ insight - I think when you've read up a little and  
tried some more apps you'll know better what you're looking for.

Stroller.
