</I>
You'd need to export every image from iPhoto before doing this.

I think that Canon Camera Window (the app that actually imports from  
the camera before starting ImageBrowser) allows you a bunch of  
options about which subfolders it'll use, but otherwise I consider it  
a &quot;suggested organisation&quot; or a &quot;base-line&quot; one - I'm pretty sure you  
can make new folders &amp; move the images around without ImageBrowser  
getting the hump about it.

So from that point of view &quot;ImageBrowser organisation&quot; equals &quot;manual  
organisation&quot; as far as I'm concerned. A lot of professionals still  
manage their images by hand, and they're amongst significant  
detractors of Aperture - many of them like Adobe Bridge because it  
allows manual organisation the same way I understand ImageBrowser to  
do; it is _certainly_ Finder-compatible. If you manage images by hand  
you can easily have whatever kind of 2006-08-01 folder hierarchy you  
like and copy those images to your &quot;Granny's Birthday&quot; folder; you  
can delete the copies of the images that you don't think are worth  
printing (whilst keeping the originals) and you can have a separate  
&quot;edited&quot; subfolder.

&gt;<i> Archive current iPhoto library and start over with SLR images?
</I>
That's pretty much what I did.

But then I considered my 2 megapixel &amp; 4mp point-and-shoot cameras  
pretty much just as tools for simply illustrating eBay auctions &amp;  
Usenet postings; I have a handful of family photos (my father's dog)  
in iPhoto. I consider my dSLR more as the tool of an artist or  
professional for capturing high-quality images of interesting or  
beautiful subjects; now I have a pet of my own I have a large section  
within Aperture of &quot;Bunny Portraiture&quot;.

If I were particularly attached to my older photos then I might well  
want them in one place.

&gt;<i> Manually name files vs keeping camera file naming?
</I>
I have the import functions name files as &quot;EOS_350D_&lt;date&gt;_&lt;index&gt;&quot;,  
but consider much beyond that to be unhelpful. I suppose that &quot;Dave's  
Birthday 1&quot; ... &quot;Dave's Birthday 30&quot; is a useful way of naming  
images, but I'd find it tedious naming images &quot;Dave blowing out the  
candles&quot;, &quot;Dave and the stripper&quot;, &quot;Dave passed out drunk&quot; individually.

Generally I want the image _filename_ to be consistent within all my  
photos. I like the date to be in the name because that's one thing  
that's universal and I can search for (from Finder or Spotlight) in  
an emergency. Note that &quot;titling&quot; the image within iPhoto will  
probably not change its filename, nor from within Lightroom or  
Aperture. Generally I find images by looking within the appropriate  
album within these apps.
