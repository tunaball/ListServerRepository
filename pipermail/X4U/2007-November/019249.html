Well, I don't know about you all, but I have a Sharp 46 inch Aquos and  
HDTV service through Comcast.  I get about 25 HD channels that all  
broadcast with stunning clarity.  Before that, I had Directv and when  
we got our first HDTV, I asked them about HD services and got about  
the same song and dance:  $400 for a different receivers, etc, etc.   
Comcast was the answer.  Now that I no longer have Directv, I get all  
kinds of promotional stuff from them in the mail offering HDTV with no  
extra charge for any of the 'formerly optional $$$$$' stuff.  I just  
smile and throw it away.
It is true that after 2009, anybody who still has an analog TV will  
need to purchase a converter as all TV signals will be broadcast in HD.
One thing to remember though is that you can purchase an antenna that  
will pick up local stations that are now broadcasting in HD and get  
them directly on your Mac or HDTV.  Locally, in Miami, CBS, NBC, Fox,  
ABC and PBS broadcast HDTV signals that I can pick up with the 'rabbit  
ears' type HDTV antenna and get the signal on the Mac, I forget what  
software I use.
