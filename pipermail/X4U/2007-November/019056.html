<PRE>Actually, that was my first thought for a diagnosis. I didn't start  
thinking it was possibly a machine related issue until I found out  
that my wife, who is an excellent typist, also has the same problem.  
If I type slowly and consciously, I never have the problem... which  
is why I assumed it was me.

It must be US however. As I type this, I tried to duplicate the  
double capitalization. And I can't reproduce the effect, no matter  
how fast I typed the second letter after releasing the shift key.

Guess I need to make an appointment with Mavis.

Thanks for the input.

John
