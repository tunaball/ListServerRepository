Skimmed through the articles but good luck to them. I think it's quite  
positive that people like the OS enough to go to this sort of effort.  
It shows that the Mac is coming of age (at last!).

Should Apple be worried? I wouldn't have thought so. Apple hardware  
commands a bit of a price premium but it's not so large - and  
generally Apple hardware is well designed, reliable and robust. As the  
author of the article points out: &quot;Building a DIY Mac requires some  
work on your part, so be ready to dedicate time to this project.&quot; How  
many professional Mac users have time to waste building their own  
system with the on-going support worries that may include? How many  
home users have the ability and desire to build their own systems  
(with the on-going support worries that may include)?

If I were to consider building my own Mac, it wouldn't be my primary  
machine - but that's a moot point as I don't have the time (or  
inclination) to do so.

&lt;battening down hatches&gt;

As regards the legalities, there should be a quote (to be taken with a  
pinch of salt) that &quot;resorting to law is the last refuge of the failed  
argument&quot; - or something similar. As long as the systems are for  
personal use and not for resale, I don't see what the big issue is  
here. Apple hardware is professionally built, has warranties, will be  
supported by OS upgrades for a reasonable period of time, etc, etc.

&lt;/battening down hatches&gt;
