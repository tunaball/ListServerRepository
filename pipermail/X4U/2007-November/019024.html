Hi John,

I'm not being funny, or anything, but* can you get the same behaviour  
with someone else typing?

A customer of mine is next week getting a laptop keyboard replaced by  
Dell because she noticed that I had the same problem as her when I  
came to set the machine up for her. We both found ourselves having to  
go back and edit because words were left uncapitalised - obviously  
the shift key was a little insensitive, as it worked fine when we  
made a conscious effort using it.

Your case seems different, as you seem to get the problem with two  
different keyboards on two different machines. I'm not being funny,  
or anything, but it occurs to me that it's possible your might find  
your problem eventually resolved by the attention of an experienced  
typing instructor.

Stroller.




* &quot;I'm not being funny, or anything, but&quot; = famous last words.
