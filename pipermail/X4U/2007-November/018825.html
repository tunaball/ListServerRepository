---SNIP--------

I had at&amp;t for a couple of years and even when Yahoo became partners.  
I ended up switching to a cable modem (comcast). The reason I did so  
was that their (AT&amp;T-YAHOO) tech support (besides telling me every  
time I had an email issue was to delete and re-install my email  
package. I rebelled and told them where to get off.  The last year I  
had them the support went to INDIA and talk about POOR support. They  
advised that a bouncing problem was in my house and that they would  
have to send a repair man out and it would cost me $100. The next day  
the local person called up and when I explained the issue he said  
they were nuts and it was a server issue (duh...). I won't tell you  
the other horror stories about Indian TS. I got fed up with them and  
went with COMCAST. While their support is average the number of times  
a day I loose the connection to the INTERNET is a real PITA. I am  
staying with comcast at least they are local and give average  
support. I am not happy with it but its the only option I have left.
