<PRE>Hey, gang,

I have a 13&quot; MacBook, which I bought 15/06/2006. Since I ordered by  
phone from Apple I'd guess it may have arrived a week or two later.

Originally when the laptop was new the battery meter would read &quot;4  
hours remaining&quot; when fully charged and I would say I probably got at  
least 3.5 hours out of it. When it was new I would get a warning when  
there was 10 or 12 minutes remaining, and if I didn't save my work &amp;  
connect to a charger then the laptop would go dead when 3 or 4  
minutes showed as remaining.

The above behaviour is just as I experienced with my previous 12&quot;  
Powerbook G4, which I must've bought in 2004 and which I owned for 2  
or 2.5 years. The battery charge would give me about the same number  
of hours and it would warn me &amp; cut out in exactly the same way with  
a few minutes remaining on the clock. I figured that even when I'd  
owned it all that time -  2 or 2.5 years - the battery life was not  
less than 75% or 80% of what it had been originally.

Around about May or June this year the graphics card in my G5 died  
and the MacBook started getting a little more use - perhaps 4 extra  
hours per day - and I was quickly annoyed to find that it was running  
out of charge &amp; shutting down without warning. In July I logged a  
call to AppleCare to complain about this &amp; they asked me to reset my  
PRAM, but my G5 was fixed shortly afterwards, so the matter became no  
longer so pressing.

Within a couple of weeks it became apparent, however, that the  
problem hadn't been resolved and by I'd estimate that by last month  
battery life was down to 2 hours or less. Last night the laptop cut  
out dead when it was displaying 25 minutes remaining.

So I called Apple about this this afternoon, and they tried to tell  
me that batteries wear out, deteriorate &amp; that mine is within  
specification. What are the member's thoughts on this?

The short story is that after I expressed my dissatisfaction the  
support agent at Apple agreed to give me a new battery &quot;as a  
courtesy&quot;. Based on a &quot;full charge capacity (mAh)&quot; of 4105 in System  
Profiler they reckoned the battery to be 80% as good as new, but that  
just doesn't jibe with the number of hours I seem to be getting out  
of it - unless I'm misunderestimating quite badly, I'm getting about  
half the battery life I originally did.

Part of the reason that Apple agreed to this replacement was that  
they started out by saying that one should only expect 300 charge  
cycles out of a battery and that mine has 302 (again, shown in System  
Profiler). I replied by observing that 50 or 100 of those must've  
been in the last 6 months since I first reported the problem and they  
said that I'd reported 302 charge cycles in July. Either their logs  
are wrong or the flash memory (??) inside this battery is knackered.  
I suppose that could cause the problem I'm seeing.

I'd better add that the usage of my Powerbook &amp; my MacBook has been  
about the same - my laptop gets fully charged, and is then normally  
used for a day or two until it's flat and fully charged again.  
Sometimes it's charged up again when it's only halfway flat, but not  
so often. It probably averages three &quot;charge cycles&quot; (if I'm using  
that term correctly) per week, perhaps 3.5. The exception to this was  
indeed when my G5 was misbehaving, but again it was generally fully  
charged &amp; discharged each time; I guess it may have racked up a  
maximum of 100 charge cycles over that 2 month period, but that's  
absolute tops. Obviously I don't think that's a big contributing  
factor, but perhaps I'm mistaken?

As I said to the AppleCare guy - I absolutely wouldn't be complaining  
if battery life was down to 75% or 80% of what it was originally -  
I'd consider that quite reasonable.

What I can offer to the list is that if you have problems with your  
battery then report them early. If AppleCare's staff starts to  
indicate that they reckon you should buy a new battery then you might  
nevertheless get a warranty replacement if you're polite &amp; present  
your case well.

I'd love to hear the list's thoughts &amp; experiences over laptop  
battery life in return. A bonus question: in System Profiler, under  
Power it says &quot;first low level warning: no&quot;. Is this the setting that  
disables the battery from saying &quot;yikes! I'm about to power down, so  
you should save your work&quot;? And if so, how do I turn it on again,  
please? Apple didn't ask me a thing about this when I was on the  
phone to them today.

Thanks in advance for any comments or advice,

Stroller.
