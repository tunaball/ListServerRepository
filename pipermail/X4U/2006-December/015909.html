<PRE>I have two Macs, 4 Desktop PC's, 4 Laptop PC's, and 6 eMate 300's.  My wife
still uses a PC although she does like the Macs.  We don't have the budget
for another Mac right now.  The PC's were all less than $50 except for the
gaming box I built several years ago.  The most I paid for any of the PC
laptops was $20.  The eMate 300's are interesting, but I don't have an old
enough Mac to interface with them at this time.

We are in our 30's and the remark about disposable income is right on the
money.  My iBook G4 will have to soldier on for at least two more years
unless I use student loans to upgrade and give it to my wife.  My daughter
is using a Blueberry iMac.  The PC's are good for games and that's about it.

As our income increases we will eventually be a Mac and Linux only
household.  Especailly since Quake 3 Arena and Unreal Tournament 2004 are
being/have been ported.

Until then I still have to deal with flaky PC hardware from time to time.
Oh well, it's the difference between an old VW Beetle (PC) and a brand new
Passat (New Mac).  By the way I drive a 1964 VW beetle approx. 120 mile per
day M-F to and from work.  It's cheap to maintain and keep on the road, but
there are many nicer vehicles out there.  I just don't have the disposable
income to buy one yet.  Same with computers.

I'm in my mid-30's and used to enjoy my local MUG meetings until OS X.  I
got tired of hearing everyone complain about the changes and sofware
compatibility issues.  I went back just as the Intel move occured and heard
even more compaining about the hardware.  For me the Mac has always been
about usability.  You plug it in and it works.  No muss, no fuss.  I don't
care what hardware/software they use as long as that basic functionality
remains.

Sorry about the long post.  I really enjoy the comments on this list and
figured it was time to pipe up.
