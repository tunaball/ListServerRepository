<PRE>Hi Folks -
I sure could use a good steer toward some detailed step by step  
instructions for printing from an XP client to a USB printer on an  
iMac G5 running OS 10.4.8.

The computers are networked via hard wire ethernet thru a D-Link  
router. We have no trouble at all with the shared internet  
connection, just getting the two computers to talk to each other has  
been a problem.

Can you suggest a site that has been helpful for you for setting up a  
XP(client)  to Mac-USB printer?

I've found so many hits by googling that it's not really helpful...  
especially those that contain info about earlier operating systems.

I do have connection between the two computers in that I am able to  
access the iMac files from the XP laptop, but not vice versa. All  
attempts to connect from the iMac to the laptop are met with an error  
message (error code -43). But at least I do know now that the two  
machines can talk to each other... so I figure the problem is in the  
setup for the printer.

     I've turned to trying to get the XP computer to print on the USB  
printer connected to the iMac. Done all the things I'm supposed to...  
turning on printer sharing in the Sharing pref, turning on printer  
sharing in Print and Fax pref. , getting the work groups to match, etc.

After I do all the things I think I'm supposed to do,  I try to add a  
new printer to the to the printer list on the Windows machine. Even  
using the Wizard I'm unable to get it to recognize any printer. I get  
stumped when it asks for the URL to the printer. The example seems to  
be what one would use to connect to another Windows computer. I've  
tried everything I can think of using info from the experience of  
setting up the PC to Mac file sharing.. but nothing seems to work.

 From all I've read getting shared printing ought to be pretty  
simple.... so I must be missing something.

If you've got a good web reference for connecting an XP client  to an  
iMac-G5 running OS 10.4.8 as a print server I'd appreciate the lead.  
Step by step instructions would be very helpful.

Thanks,
John
