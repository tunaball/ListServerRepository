<PRE>Well, I finally got to testing this and found out what the issue is (I 
think...).

I tried your suggestion below Phil, but found that I had already activated 
ARD's VNC so I stopped the VNC server and had a user connect via Chicken, 
which was successful. However, within that one session the Option key 
sticking business happened again.

Without restarting the Mac I turned off ARD's VNC access and the keyboard 
immediately typed as it should. So with us ARD's VNC seems to have been 
causing it. It's been a few days now since it was deactivated and so far 
nobody has complained about it.

Many thanks for pointing me in that direction, otherwise I wouldn't have 
thought about trying it.

Cheers,

Brett

ps. I vaguely remember activating ARD's VNC at the time I was playing 
around with VNC server so that's why I tied the two together... I was in 
the right vicinity tho!  8-}

This might help narrow down the problem: On the server machine, turn 
on Apple Remote Desktop in the Sharing Preferences Panel and turn off 
VNC Server. Then connect with Chicken of the VNC and see if the 
problem goes away. (Apple Remote Desktop is compatible with Chicken of 
the VNC. That's how I manage my home server.)

If it does then the problem may be VNC Server, if not then maybe a 
keyboard setting in Chicken of the VNC is effecting the server's 
settings.
