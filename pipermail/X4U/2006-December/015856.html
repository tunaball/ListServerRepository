&gt;<i>Actually, I did ask Corey if I could try to sell one. He doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i>think it will, but I decided to go ahead and put it up on ebay last  
</I>&gt;<i>night, just to see if it would get any hits. 
</I>
You might want to join a few Mac discussion forums to let folks know that 
it is available.

&gt;<i>Cost is the thing. I  
</I>&gt;<i>figured out that the item itself, not including the labor to make it,  
</I>&gt;<i>costs at least $20. The engraving for the plaque was more than the  
</I>&gt;<i>wood or the clock. 
</I>
I'd expect a handmade clock like that to go for several times that.  

&gt;<i>It would help him so much if he could sell these. 
</I>
Keep in mind that if he were to start selling these in quantity, he would 
need Apple's permission to use their logo.

&gt;<i>I love your Macquarium! I've always wanted a MacQuarium! I have  
</I>&gt;<i>several extras sitting around in my museum, but I'm not sure I have  
</I>&gt;<i>what it takes to make one. And, I really don't care for fish, that  
</I>&gt;<i>much. Now, if I could find some fake fix, that would be a different  
</I>&gt;<i>story.
</I>
The hardest part of making a Macquarium is getting the tank watertight 
and keeping it watertight.  One option is to instead make a Macterrarium, 
which isn't as touchy about being watertight.  (And you don't like fish 
anyway.)
