Someone else may be able to help you some, but surely not as well as  
they might have been able to had you given us more information. I  
certainly can't help when you say &quot;IIRC I did something vague&quot;.

An account name is different from the name of the Mac - users and  
computers are different &amp; separate under OS X. Which did you really  
change?
How did you change it?
Did you do so through System Preferences?
Through Netinfo Manager?
I hope you didn't try changing the name of the user through Finder!  
That would certainly b0rk things up.

Saying &quot;IIRC&quot; is acceptable if one is providing an answer to a  
question - in this case one is helping the original poster and a  
little vagueness may be forgivable if the rest of the reply contains  
useful information. Being vague when asking for help (&quot;IIRC&quot;) is -  
I'm sorry - just lame; your comments about what you've done do not  
help anyone diagnose the problem.

Your post could more succinctly been written:

    I was messing around with my Mac &amp; I b0rked something up. All my
    user preferences have been reset to their defaults but - more
    importantly - Parallels is unable to find the Windows installation.
    How do I find the Windows files and tell Parallels where they are,
    please?

Such a post would actually help us help you,

Stroller.
