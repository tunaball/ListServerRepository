<PRE>Hmmmm, tried looking for the Bluetooth installer on the OSX Install disc, 
no luck.Were you referring to a specific Bluetooth installer disc? I can 
only see Firmware updates on the Apple site so thought I'd try and 
download the 1.1 update and run that, then run the 1.2 updater again. 
After trying to run the 1.1 updater and rebooting I no longer have the 
Bluetooth preference showing at all, though it is there in the System 
folder- even tried replacing it from another System build I have. When I 
try to run any of the Bluetooth core services apps (from System Folder) it 
says I don't have the hardware module... so either it was on its way out 
and I gave it a helping hand over the cliff or the firmware updates failed 
and have rendered it useless.

On a 15&quot; AlBook, is this a separate attached chip/board or is it part of 
the motherboard? Anyone have any suggestions on how to wake it/fix it? 
It's still under warranty but letting daddy's little helper go to the shop 
for a while is rather undesirable at this time of the year!

Coj

You might try to reinstall the Mouse software on the CD or from Apple 
online.
