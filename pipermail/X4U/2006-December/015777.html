I would think you would copy your home folder, which is where your  
iTunes music files are stored...
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now think tracks I can't access. Why keep them? They don't get  
</I>&gt;<i> copied across.
</I>
You mean you don't copy them.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I can manage my track authorisation list, great. Tell me how.  
</I>&gt;<i> (As an administrator for at least a dozen Mac servers of various  
</I>&gt;<i> flavours I should be able to cope - but I want to manage from a  
</I>&gt;<i> centralised point, remotely, with administrator privileges). Show  
</I>&gt;<i> me how to do this and I may use iTunes store a bit more.
</I>
 From the iTunes Store, check your account info; it tells you how  
many computers are authorized.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, as it stands, some of the tracks I've purchased are  
</I>&gt;<i> authorised to five computers long since gone. How do I de-authorise  
</I>&gt;<i> them? (Ah. OK. Found the de-authorise all button in the &quot;View my  
</I>&gt;<i> account...&quot; menu item).
</I>
Yep.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah. Sod it. I've wasted more time tippety tapping out these emails  
</I>&gt;<i> than it would have taken to go and buy the CDs from Amazon. At GBP  
</I>&gt;<i> 15 per album, to replace all my iTunes tracks would cost GBP 45 -  
</I>&gt;<i> and then no more of this faffing about. Realistically, it'll cost  
</I>&gt;<i> me less than that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now tell me, why do I want to use the iTunes store?
</I>
You obviously don't. :-)
