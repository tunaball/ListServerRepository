Actually, no. It's simply that I tend to use the move from one  
machine to another (or a hard drive upgrade) as an excuse to do some  
spring cleaning. I copy across the stuff I need and then make some  
form of archive copy of the old data so that if I need something in  
the future, I can go get it. But think garage storage. After you've  
not needed something for a few months - maybe a year - it's chucked  
in the garage. A couple of years down the line, you know it's in the  
garage but there's got to be a pretty compelling reason to go dig it  
out. (Compressed disk archives on DVDs anyone?)

Now think tracks I can't access. Why keep them? They don't get copied  
across.

If I can manage my track authorisation list, great. Tell me how. (As  
an administrator for at least a dozen Mac servers of various flavours  
I should be able to cope - but I want to manage from a centralised  
point, remotely, with administrator privileges). Show me how to do  
this and I may use iTunes store a bit more.

Anyway, as it stands, some of the tracks I've purchased are  
authorised to five computers long since gone. How do I de-authorise  
them? (Ah. OK. Found the de-authorise all button in the &quot;View my  
account...&quot; menu item).

Ah. Sod it. I've wasted more time tippety tapping out these emails  
than it would have taken to go and buy the CDs from Amazon. At GBP 15  
per album, to replace all my iTunes tracks would cost GBP 45 - and  
then no more of this faffing about. Realistically, it'll cost me less  
than that.

Now tell me, why do I want to use the iTunes store?
