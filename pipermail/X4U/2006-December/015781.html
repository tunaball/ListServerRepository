I wish I could remember exactly what I did to make shared printing 
work on a Windows machine. I do know that it involved a mixed Mac/PC 
network getting internet from a Linksys wireless router. I plugged an 
Airport Base Station (Extreme) into the Linksys and a USB printer 
into the USB port of the Base Station.  On a Mac, I used the Airport 
Setup Assistant to make the Airport Base Station join the Lindasys 
nework. Then on the Mac I created a Bonjour printer. On the PC I got 
it to find the wireless network, then created a new printer with a 
standard local TCP/IP port, giving it the IP address that the Linksys 
was giving to the Airport Base Station. I created the printer on that 
port (this was an Epson printer). I realized later that I hadn't 
needed to wire the Base Station to the Linksys. Over the phone I had 
the client unplug the Base Station from the Linksys, and it continued 
to work for both PC and Mac.

I believe the keys were: having a USB port on the Base Station for 
the printer, and making a local TCP/IP port on the Windows XP 
machine, and creating the printer on that port.

Here are instructions (I haven't tried it this way) for printing from 
Windows to a USB printer connected to a Mac. It may be old, but also 
maybe there's a hint there that you can use:
