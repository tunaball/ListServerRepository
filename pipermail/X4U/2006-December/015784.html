You're mis-reading and mis-quoting what I said:

&quot;Actually, no. It's simply that I tend to use the move from one  
machine to another (or a hard drive upgrade) as an excuse to do some  
spring cleaning. I copy across the stuff I need and then make some  
form of archive copy of the old data so that if I need something in  
the future, I can go get it.&quot;

I was replying in the negative to Kirk's assertion that I &quot;didn't  
back up&quot; my files - although to be fair, re-reading the post it's not  
100% clear. Double negatives and all that I guess.

&gt;&gt;<i> Now think tracks I can't access. Why keep them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because all you have to do is authorize the new computer. If that's  
</I>&gt;<i> too much of a hassle, then the iTMS isn't for you.  I just don't  
</I>&gt;<i> think its fair to blame Apple for the loss of those tracks. As I  
</I>&gt;<i> said, if they were purchased and downloaded with no DRM and you  
</I>&gt;<i> failed to back them up, they're gone just as surely.
</I>
Again, no. iTunes was telling me that I couldn't authorise the tracks  
on the newest computer as I'd already authorised on 5 computers  
previously. At the time, I didn't know about de-authorising  
computers. So shoot me.

I will agree that iTunes music store is not for me. It sells music at  
a questionable bit rate with DRM which detracts from my ease of use  
while offering little in return.

My opinion of course.
