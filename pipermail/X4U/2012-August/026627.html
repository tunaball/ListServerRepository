<PRE>From the NY Times:

A jury awarded Apple more than $1 billion in damages after finding that Samsung infringed a series of Apple patents on smartphones and tablet computers, in a closely watched court case that could have broad implications for the mobile business.
As the jury&#8217;s verdict was read in a federal court case in San Jose, Calif., Apple appeared to prevail on many of its claims against Samsung, according to Reuters. These included allegations that various Samsung products violated an Apple patent covering the &#8220;bounce back&#8221; effect when a user scrolls to the end of a list, and the pinch-to-zoom gesture that users make when they want to magnify an image on their screens.
It was the first in a wave of legal cases in the United States involving smartphone patents to reach a jury trial, and the one with the highest profile because the parties in the suit, Samsung and Apple, are the two biggest makers of smartphones in the world.

In a big legal victory for Apple that could have broad implications for the mobile business, a jury awarded the company more than $1 billion in damages Friday after finding that Samsung infringed on a series of Apple patents on smartphones and tablet computers.
The verdict could have a major impact on Android, the Google operating system used by Samsung and many other companies in their devices. Apple&#8217;s suit against Samsung, the world&#8217;s largest maker of smartphones, has partly been viewed as a proxy war against Google, which Apple executives have derided as a copycat.
A nine-person jury sided with Apple on most of its allegations, including patent claims involving the &#8220;bounce back&#8221; effect when a user scrolls to the end of a list, the pinch-to-zoom gesture that users make when they want to magnify an image, and the physical design of the iPhone.
The jury added some sting by finding in favor of Apple across the board in a countersuit by Samsung.
