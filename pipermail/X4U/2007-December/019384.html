In my 20+ years of using laser printers, I've never come across a  
printer that I couldn't 'un-jam'.  Look at the owner's manual and  
you'll see that there are various parts that you can open to find that  
jammed piece of paper.  The most common place that you'll find it is  
at the point where it is fed from the paper tray into the printer.   
None of this is difficult, and  1000's of people tackle this problem  
on a daily basis.  Before you go spending money, take a look at the  
various parts that open....remove the toner cartridge, remove anything  
inside that you can, you'll find the paper!  Then just put everything  
back together.
Even if you don't know any Mac users with a laser printer, if you know  
somebody with a PC printer they can help as well, they all get paper  
jams.  Don't go throwing your money away for something as simple as  
that.  Just ask for help!
I'm in the Miami area...if I'm anywhere near to where you live, hell,  
I'll even come over and fix it for you.
