<PRE>System: iMac w/OS 10.5.1
Wireless Network using a new Airport Extreme Base Station

Here is my situation:  It all started when my 
wife tried to load her favorite Web page at 
<A HREF="http://hpana.com">http://hpana.com</A> - the site now takes well over 5 
minutes to load. This started some time after 
updating the recent security update 2007-009 
Version 1.0 and shortly thereafter version 1.1. I 
have tried using the other Mac computers in the 
house, using the same wireless network and the 
same problem presents itself. I have tried 
loading the page using friend's computers (Mac 
and PC, from out side my home) and the page loads 
within seconds. I have tried using Safari, IE and 
Firefox (at home), the problem remains. I 
contacted the hpana.com Webmaster and they have 
made no changes to their web site.

I disconnected our cable modem, and connected the 
modem directly to the iMac (by passing the Apple 
Airport) and the page loads within seconds. I'm 
guessing it has something to do with the Airport 
Extreme.

So, I contacted Apple Support. The issue was 
quickly elevated and eventually forwarded to the 
Airport Extreme Hardware guys - I expect to get 
an answer by Mid January 2008.

I took a trip to the local Apple store and after 
explaining the situation, the store manger 
replaced the AirPort Extreme with the hope this 
would resolve the issue. After getting the &quot;new&quot; 
Airport Extreme up and running &#138; the problem 
remained. This particular web site hpana.com 
still takes well over 5 minutes to load. I have 
no such issue with some of the other 60 or so 
sites I tried.

I by passed the &quot;new&quot; Airport once again by 
connecting the cable modem directly to the iMac 
and, as before the web page loads within seconds.

I'll wait until I get a response from Apple come 
January, but I was wondering if anyone on the 
Forum would be willing to share their respective 
opinions.

Thank You and Happy Holidays.
