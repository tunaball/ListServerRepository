<PRE>I just installed a 250GB drive and 10.5.1 on my MacBook, that had
been running 10.4.11 on a 100GB drive very happily.
The drive is fine but, so far, I'm an unhappy Leonard switcher.

I can only relate two problems, and one annoyance, but
-to me- they're biggies.

1) The annoyance: I put the old 100GB drive, with 10.4.11,
in an external USB housing. I was pleased to discover the
drive was still bootable, and I could run the MacBook from
the housing. But when I installed Leopard (from the DVD),
the Mac transfer program specifically said I had to connect
the old drive with a Firewire cable. So I copied the old
drive to a Firewire drive I had, and then ran the transfer
program.

THE TRANSFER PROGRAM WAS HAPPY WITH THE USB-
CONNECTED DRIVE. Bringing over the Firewire drive
had been unnecessary! The transfer from the USB drive
&quot;just worked&quot;. Why didn't Apple check and fix the
instructions?

2) Problem 1: All browsers no longer do &quot;domain guessing&quot;.
I'm connected using Verizon DSL. Now, for example, when
I type &quot;jr&quot; in the address bar (for jr.com, which is J&amp;R) and
hit &quot;return&quot;, the browser loads the Verizon-Yahoo search
page (with jr.com as the first entry). Old behavior: the browser
would automagically add the &quot;www.&quot; and the &quot;.com&quot;. This is
a major PITA; had I known, it would have been a show-stopper.

It's repeatable; and happens on Safari 3.0.4 and Firefox 2.0.0.11.
Camino works the same way. Strangely, it also happens on an
old Netscape browser that had been &quot;guessing&quot; fine. While it
sounds like Verizon is behind this, my wife's PowerBook, right
next to me on the kitchen table, does domain-guessing like
Macs always did.

I found an about:config change that was supposed to fix this,
but it didn't help.

3) I'll relate this in another post.

</PRE>
