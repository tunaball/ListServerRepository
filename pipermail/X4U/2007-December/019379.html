Those old Apple LaserWriters and HP's were tanks.  New, inexpensive  
laser printers print faster, have higher resolution and have a  
smaller footprint.  But they probably won't last as long.

HP printers for the Mac went downhill around the time that  OS X was  
introduced.  HP was all set to be the OEM supplier of Apple-branded  
printers around that time, and then Steve Jobs had a falling out with  
them and it never came off.  Since then HP has often had terrible  
service and support for Mac users.  If you follow a number of Mac  
discussion forums you will hear a surprising number of horror  
stories, along with stories about how the latest OS X update isn't  
compatible with some HP printers and HP is slow (or worse) to update  
the drivers.  Personally, I just don't recommend HP products anymore.

Brother has been the shining star for inexpensive, yet reliable low- 
cost laser printers for the Mac.  Brother has a couple of tiny laser  
printers that are very inexpensive, which I don't recommend.  (I call  
them the pancake models.)

But get above these two models and their products are the bomb:

The HL-5240 is a workhorse.  It even includes Postscript.  But it  
doesn't include Ethernet, if you need that.
Here it is for $126
