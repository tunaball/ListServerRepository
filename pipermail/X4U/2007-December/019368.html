And for those of us whose DNS servers aren't broken/performing bad it  
works as it always has.
Of course Firefox on windows had domain guessing, this is a browser  
feature not an OS
feature.

I'm still curious regarding the difference in behavior.  In the Apple  
Discussion forums there are
individuals running 10.4.11 posting the same issue -- are you running  
10.4.11?

</I>&gt;<i> Well, I'm using Tiger 10.4.11 and VerizonDSL as my isp and i now  
</I>&gt;<i> also get the previously noted verizon search page on both safari  
</I>&gt;<i> 3.0.4 and firefox 2.0.0.9. After a little research on the matter, it  
</I>&gt;<i> seems that as of June 2007, verizon rolled out a new &quot;service&quot; that  
</I>&gt;<i> places a branded (read: revenue source) verizon search page to  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;help&quot; customers while browsing. Apparently, enrollment is automatic  
</I>&gt;<i> and while there is an opt-out for the service... it is a bit hidden  
</I>&gt;<i> and only found after you click on the &quot;about this page&quot; button, as  
</I>&gt;<i> well as convoluted involving manipulation of the modem used with  
</I>&gt;<i> your verizon broadband. Further, I've read that the opt-out option  
</I>&gt;<i> may not be available for safari or firefox. I plan to call verizon  
</I>&gt;<i> support in the next couple of days and will get back with any  
</I>&gt;<i> relevant info.
</I>
Again, I would point out that Apple has open source at the core and  
this behavior may
result from a change in something beyond their control (I noticed an  
upgrade to
Bind in 10.4.11).  There were also several bugs for WebCore and WebKit  
patched,
but as the problem seems to be not just Safari related, and I'm not  
sure how Firefox
et. al. use  these if at all, these may be irrelevant as well.

One explanation of the difference in behavior could be simply that  
your 10.4.x box is
using a different DNS server than the 10.5.x box (a packet trace using  
the method I
posted earlier would clearly demonstrate whether this was happening).

Perhaps over the holiday I'll try investigating further but at this  
point I don't have the
time or the resource (Leopard I have only at work as I've not had time  
to upgrade
at home).
