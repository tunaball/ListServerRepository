It's present, all right, but I'd be interested in hearing what 
happens if you click the &quot;Configure&quot; button (or it's called something 
like that).   When I hit Configure Printer on the LaserWriter, I get 
&quot;You don't have permission to access the resource on this server.&quot;

</I>
Follow what link? To their Configure page? If so, you're getting 
further than I am.

&gt;<i>I think this is simply because upgrading the version of CUPS 
</I>&gt;<i>manually breaks Printer Setup Utility &amp; whatnot, the Apple version 
</I>&gt;<i>of CUPS (1.1?) being taken from an older release of the cups.org one 
</I>&gt;<i>(now 1.2 / 1.3). There's an article here 
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;<A HREF="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20070227212742511">http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20070227212742511</A>&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>about using CUPS 1.2.8 with Mac OS X 10.4.8.
</I>
I'm really going to drop this thread, because I don't know enough 
about it to describe clearly, or comment usefully, about what I&quot;m 
seeing, but others seem to be able to telnet to their printer, or 
find out its IP address, or get to it with a browser, or access it 
with CUPS, and I&quot;m denied all those access points. I don't know why 
and don't know how to find out why. I have exhausted Google as a 
resource for anything I can remotely understand. If it were terribly 
important to me, at this point I would actually find and call in a 
consultant, because I don't get why others can see it and my efforts 
either time out or end in a message that I don't have permission, or 
that the browser can't open the page &quot;because it can't open the page&quot;.

&gt;<i>It's all a bit moot, since we don't seem to have the right model 
</I>&gt;<i>number for M. Milligan's Dell printer. I'm extremely confident one 
</I>&gt;<i>won't find official Mac drivers for Dell printers, nor any other 
</I>&gt;<i>kind of support at Dell's site, so it's a fairly general statement I 
</I>&gt;<i>make when I say that CUPS is generally the direction I'd look in, 
</I>&gt;<i>were I in M's position.
</I>
I hope it works for him.
