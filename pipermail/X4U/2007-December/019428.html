I can understand the need for being compact, while my primary camera 
is a Nikon D70, I occasionally use the 3MP little Kodak (4x optical) 
that we had before the D70.  For an early Christmas present this year 
I bought my wife a little Nikon Coolpix (3x optical, 6MP) that is a 
lot smaller than the Kodak.

I think your best bet will be to research which &quot;pocket camera's&quot; 
offer Macro options.  I've seen a couple with &quot;clip-on&quot; Macro 
Adapters.  I don't know how well this will work though.  With a 
digital SLR camera, macro lens, tripod and shutter release you have 
major control of depth of field and camera stability for Macro 
Photography.  I use the Nikon for everything from Macro shots, up to 
Trains.  Believe it or not I think you'll be happier with a &quot;pocket 
camera&quot; than your wife will be.  You had better not show her the 
Nikon R1 flash kit for Nikon SLR camera's and Macro photography. :^)

I don't know if it's possible, but if you can, try to find one that 
will last.  If you're seriously thinking about a Digital SLR in the 
long term, you'll still want to be able to use the &quot;pocket camera&quot;. 
Sometimes it just isn't practical to lug a SLR camera around, and 
we've been at least one place that allowed our Kodak, but wouldn't 
allow our Nikon (we knew in advance).
