<PRE>Amazingly, the extra information provided in this email makes it  
simpler to figure out a solution.

Create a smart folder on the desktop with &quot;kind is any&quot; and &quot;name  
begins with z&quot; and change &quot;contents&quot; to &quot;filename&quot;

That will give you ALL the files and folders that start with &quot;z&quot; on  
your Mac.

Then you can do with them what you want. Unfortunately, the finder  
doesn't appear to show the existing folder they are in or not that I  
could find in about 3 minutes of playing with the finder.

Regards,

cjc

</I>&gt;<i> I started this question out with an explanation of what I had done  
</I>&gt;<i> accidentally and (I thought) what I was trying to accomplish and  
</I>&gt;<i> that was find the files I had inadvertently moved into a folder that  
</I>&gt;<i> contains over 100+ folders. I needed to essentially find all the  
</I>&gt;<i> files I had dragged and dropped accidentally into that folder. It  
</I>&gt;<i> looks to me like when the drop happened the finder (or who ever is  
</I>&gt;<i> doing the dropping) scattered the files into at least 50 different  
</I>&gt;<i> folders. I was trying to find the files so I could move them into  
</I>&gt;<i> the correct folder (I try to be organized). Instead of opening up  
</I>&gt;<i> each of the 100 folders I was attempting to cut the number down to a  
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable number. I know that 50 is less than 100 and in some cases  
</I>&gt;<i> the folders contain 10K of files so not only did I have to wait  
</I>&gt;<i> 30-60 seconds for each folder to open I had to max down to the  
</I>&gt;<i> bottom as the files all stated with &quot;Z&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This (to me was an exercise that was pure frustration) as opening  a  
</I>&gt;<i> 100 folders does take a bit of time and then going to the bottom was  
</I>&gt;<i> just plain tedious. My intent was to minimize the tedious part. I  
</I>&gt;<i> figured if at least I could find each folder I had to open I was at  
</I>&gt;<i> least 50 percent there. I thought if I could just find the path for  
</I>&gt;<i> each file I could identify the folder(s) and only open the ones I  
</I>&gt;<i> needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On my system (10.4.11) dual core 2.7 MHz it just takes a LOT of  
</I>&gt;<i> time(up to a minute) to open up folders that contain 10K of files.  
</I>&gt;<i> It is a tedious job and *YES* I know I am to blame but (there are  
</I>&gt;<i> health issues involved) I always try and do things needing the least  
</I>&gt;<i> amount of effort as a result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this explains the issue (again) and I apologize to the group  
</I>&gt;<i> for not wanting to shut down my system to do this what should be  
</I>&gt;<i> simple operation.
</I>&gt;<i>
