I will toss my .02 in here (if that means anything). There is, IMO, a  
bit of animosity going on here and there are secret agendas as well.  
Microsoft is behind part of this as they are tired of hearing about  
MS issues and viruses so they want to make it appear as a &quot;BIG&quot; issue  
of MAC's as well. There is also some of the legendary anti (both MS  
AND MAC) hate going on.
You just have to be careful and look at histories in these  
announcements some companies have am agenda to sell their wares and  
they are over inflating any reports just to sell their product(s).  
There are *MULTIPLE* agendas and you have to be suspicious  of  
anyone. Its a complicated game and as usual it always &quot;DEPENDS&quot;.  It  
is (IMO) like political scandal (take your pick as to which one) you  
have to sit back and look at the players and the histories of ALL  
sides before you can make an intelligent decision. I will not delve  
further into any specific current topic as its up to the user to  
decide what is suspect(and its off topic). When it comes to corporate/ 
political issues it is almost never black and white so sit back and  
read a lot and read what the real independent people have to say and  
then make up your own mind.
