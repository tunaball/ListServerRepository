I started this question out with an explanation of what I had done  
accidentally and (I thought) what I was trying to accomplish and that  
was find the files I had inadvertently moved into a folder that  
contains over 100+ folders. I needed to essentially find all the  
files I had dragged and dropped accidentally into that folder. It  
looks to me like when the drop happened the finder (or who ever is  
doing the dropping) scattered the files into at least 50 different  
folders. I was trying to find the files so I could move them into the  
correct folder (I try to be organized). Instead of opening up each of  
the 100 folders I was attempting to cut the number down to a  
reasonable number. I know that 50 is less than 100 and in some cases  
the folders contain 10K of files so not only did I have to wait 30-60  
seconds for each folder to open I had to max down to the bottom as  
the files all stated with &quot;Z&quot;.

This (to me was an exercise that was pure frustration) as opening  a  
100 folders does take a bit of time and then going to the bottom was  
just plain tedious. My intent was to minimize the tedious part. I  
figured if at least I could find each folder I had to open I was at  
least 50 percent there. I thought if I could just find the path for  
each file I could identify the folder(s) and only open the ones I  
needed.

On my system (10.4.11) dual core 2.7 MHz it just takes a LOT of time 
(up to a minute) to open up folders that contain 10K of files. It is  
a tedious job and *YES* I know I am to blame but (there are health  
issues involved) I always try and do things needing the least amount  
of effort as a result.

I hope this explains the issue (again) and I apologize to the group  
for not wanting to shut down my system to do this what should be  
simple operation.

Ed
