</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This (to me was an exercise that was pure frustration) as opening  a

</I>&gt;<i>each file I could identify the folder(s) and only open the ones I 
</I>&gt;<i>needed.

Others can speak for Spotlight, but with File Buddy at least, no need 
to open folders (or even, as I suggested earlier, to go to the file 
in question by using Command + R).

Just search for files beginning with &quot;z.&quot; In the resulting list, 
highlight the ones you want, then click on File&gt;Move and choose the 
destination.
