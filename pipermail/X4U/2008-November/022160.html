Well, &quot;up to the user to decide&quot; is like saying that Fox News is fair  
and balanced. Because the user doesn't know; they don't see the  
malware, see how it works, or understand how widespread it is.

You see, I'm a Mac journalist, and I follow this stuff closely. I get  
samples of malware when many of these things appear, and I write about  
security occasionally for Macworld. So I do know just a bit about this  
issue. What strikes me as odd is the fact that there is a small but  
vocal minority of Mac users who like to demonize the security  
companies who issue alerts and warnings, as if it were there fault  
that there is malware out there. And before you reply, &quot;but there is  
no Mac malware&quot;, think carefully. Not only is there Mac malware, but  
plenty of un-savvy users get stung. (Note that I said &quot;malware&quot; not  
&quot;viruses&quot; which propagate on their own.)

Of course the security companies do this for two reasons: one to  
announce the existence of the malware, and the other to announce their  
products, but I would tend to think that the customers of these  
companies are quite happy that they act as quickly as they (or some of  
them) do.

As an aside, I find it interesting that Sophos couldn't make the  
difference between two pieces of Mac malware:

Usually they're more savvy than that.
