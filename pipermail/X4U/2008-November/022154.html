<PRE>Ah yes, I didn't get that bit from the original email. Yes, Spotlight  
is not perfect and I don't think search programs ever are or can be.

I don't understand why you want to move all these files you want to  
delete to one folder before you delete them?

Isn't that really a double step? Why not just delete them where they  
are?

Also, I wonder why the need to delete them at all? With disk space  
being so cheap, why not just move them off to an external backup disk?

Have you looked at the Spotlight Preferences available in System  
Preferences? It allows you to define what is returned and in what order.

Might be useful?

Regards,

cjc
