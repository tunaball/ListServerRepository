<PRE>Been 1/4 following this while ill, so here's my 2c now my (clinical) 
temperature is down. My opinion temperature was never up, but I'd 
like to know where Ed is coming from.  It then bounced, so I've split 
it in two (This bit shouldn't class as top-posting).

Part 1

</I>
In what way a sell out? It's the Mac that's an Apple product, not the 
CPU chip. The PPC one was IBM/Motorola, not Apple. The latter had 
given up on it and the former was (and is) only developing it further 
in those versions that are far too expensive for desktop use (and 
with a performance to match). I'd be interested to know which 
&quot;manufacture&quot; and what they &quot;invented&quot;. The only other desktop grade 
processor I'm aware of that post-dates the Pentium is Itanium, which 
is also made by Intel, and one chip costs the price of a good MacBook 
Pro.

As the article points out, they design iPhone level processors. A bit 
less capable than the current Intel chips. An order of magnitude in 
the design department.

You obviously use some rare piece of software for which there is 
insufficient demand to make developing an OS X version viable. 
Personally, one task I have on my list is to dig up an OS X driver 
for my $900 slide scanner before my G4 dies.

</I>
Please say who. It can't be HP as they have been running 32 and 64 
bit apps together for many years. I thought Sun did the same.

&gt;<i>It is bad enough to have re-invent the wheel when you have a company 
</I>&gt;<i>that has 100's of millions of dollars tied up but when you spread

</I>
You know of a company that has &quot;100's of millions of dollars&quot; tied up 
that will be adversely affected by Apple's change of O/S and/or chip? 
I'm surprised Apple has one customer that spends so much with them. A 
company that has that much tied up in IT kit will only have a very 
small percentage of it affected by Apple's changes - even if they are 
an Apple-on-the-desktop company. What it would cost them would be 
much less than the support costs for a Wintel desktop environment.

You seem to be one of the tiny number affected, but you haven't deserted yet.

8 years *is* a long time. ... In Apple's main target marketplace 
(excluding Xserve) 5 years is a long time.

&gt;<i>It is one thing to tell all your users hey go out and spend a lot of

</I>
So you would be happier if I could say &quot;I can't use my slide scanner 
anymore because Apple lagged behind and went under&quot; rather than &quot;I 
can't use my slide scanner anymore because its drivers got left 
behind&quot;
