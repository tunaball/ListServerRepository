I agree with Aron that backwards compatibility and quality control  
aren't at all the same thing, no matter how you stretch the  
definition of quality.

Backwards compatibility is high on Apple's list.  That's why they  
paid quite a bit of money to Transitive to use their technology to  
create Rosetta.  Rosetta works surprisingly well for an emulator, and  
it's seamless.

But if you are still complaining about the loss of OS 9  
compatibility, I think that it's time to get over it.  OS 9 was  
discontinued about 8 years ago, which is a huge amount of time in the  
personal computer world.  I'm surprised that Apple continued to  
support the use of OS 9 programs, in the form of Classic, for as long  
as it did.

One of the huge reasons that Microsoft was so hamstrung in getting  
out Vista is because they are trying to support too much legacy  
code.  Every industry analyst is saying that Microsoft has to ditch  
the legacy code and start over and create a new lean and fast  
operating system if they don't want to see their market share  
continue to shrink.  Apple, because they don't have to support a lot  
of legacy code, is not only able to keep on quickly updating OS X,  
but they are also able to migrate OS X to other platforms  
efficiently, like the iPhone.

Vista is a pig of an OS.  OS 9 was getting to be a pig too. While it  
was a shame to have to upgrade all of our old software, we are very  
lucky that OS X is lean and mean.
