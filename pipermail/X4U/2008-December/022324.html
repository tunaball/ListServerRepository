Randy:

Good article, thanks.

I think you are missing the issue of OS9 apps not running anymore on  
the new machines (10.5 and up). That is a major issue as far as I am  
concerned a real show stopper (to me).

I am somewhat familiar with the 64 bit issue on another machine and I  
guess I agree the switchover is going to be extremely painful. The  
other machine I am familiar with has adopted temporarily an  
environment that allows 32 bit and 64 bit application to co-exist it  
is not clear what will happen if the 64 bit only environment is going  
to do.  The manufacturer has not made it clear but I suspect that it  
will not be pretty and they may loose some of their base as they are  
loosing companies quicker now.

It is bad enough to have re-invent the wheel when you have a company  
that has 100's of millions of dollars tied up but when you spread the  
amount around to millions of people the customer base will desert  
them if they are not extremely careful.
