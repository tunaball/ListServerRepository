<PRE>So use old machines. They still work.

Seriously, there is a tradeoff between backwards compatibility and  
innovation. Maintaining backwards compatibility limits your ability to  
move forward. Attempts to work around this fundamental principle lead  
to convoluted messed up systems; i.e., Windows. Apple, as it happens  
has had better backwards compatibility than MS, while making bigger  
changes, but dropping OS 9 after 8 years is not unreasonable compared  
to MS dropping support for most XP and all earlier systems.
