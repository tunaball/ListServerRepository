Randy:

I guess we agree to disagree. Other manufactures take pride when they  
have compatibility. That tells the customer that their investment is  
sound and will be around for a LONG time.  It is one thing to tell  
all your users hey go out and spend a lot of money to replace  
functioning application for no real reason other than we don't care  
about you. It is another reason say if some basic part of the machine  
will no longer work because say technology changes. To make this  
simple, 64 bit processors (for Apple) are not really needed if they  
were then Apple long ago would have made systems with larger memory  
compacity. They have stubbornly set a max memory limit on most of  
their processors. *IF* they are doing this (and I am suggesting they  
are) then 64 bit is NOT needed in any stretch of the imagination. Any  
64 bit offering would be wasting the consumers money. If on the other  
hand the systems they (Apple) offered larger memory insertion then it  
would be a reasonable thing to do (64 bit). Its the same with any OS  
(not just Apple) the need must be there *OR* the marketing hype  
people are doing an outstanding performance. I can only compare Apple  
to one other manufacturer and they are *SLOWLY* beginning to offer 64  
bit OS's even then they are 99 percent compatible with their old  
systems. They aren't out banging the drum to dump the old they are  
providing a migration path. How it will end up is anyones guess at  
this time but rest assured if their past is anything like the present  
they will honor and make it work *RIGHT* for the majority of the old  
code. Companies are not going to out and spend 100's of millions of  
dollars just to be on the current &quot;cutting edge&quot; just to be there.  
The current Apple customer does not have money to burn like some  
corporate companies.

Backwards compatibility is *EVERYTHING* and a happy customer means  
great quality control.
