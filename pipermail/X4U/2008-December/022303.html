Just a thought here, and I am joining this way late, but you say you  
have some equipment that still works but you have no use for it/do not  
want to use it.

If that is the case, why should a manufacturer make equipment last so  
long that no one will want to use it in it's old age?

Why not just make it good enough to last as long as someone wants to  
use it?

That way, you don't have to pay a higher price for equipment you no  
longer want.

To me the manufacturers help everyone win. They sell more stuff cause  
it's cheaper. Even though it's cheaper, it still probably lasts longer  
than anyone will use it.
