<PRE>Jon,

I originally THOUGHT that the internal hard drive, which was writing  
data to the disk at the time of the bump, had been damaged and that  
is why I originally thought that I could confirm that was the problem  
by starting up on an external drive and seeing if all was fine.

When it was not fine, my limited knowledge of t/s led me down the  
paths of using the various software tools I owned.

When that did not work, I thought I was toast, but on a lark, thought  
to reset NVRAM.

It was while I was doing this that I saw the access cover for the  
RAM, and then I vaguely remembered that removing those ram boards and  
reinserting them fixed some peoples' problems.

Since I was at wits end, and looking at giving the PB to the repair  
guy, I thought I had nothing to loose by pulling and re-installing  
those boards. This &quot;got nothing-to lose&quot; whim came after 16+ hours of  
t/s.

And, you know the rest.....

Lee

You were still using the internal ram memory boards when you started
up from the external drive....
