They're following the some old trend as everything else...

I still remember the most expensive personal computer I ever bought  
for work -a Mac IIfx. It was $7000 around 1989(?). It was still  
running as a print server until about 5 years ago. It still ran, we  
just got to the point where it served no practical use. The Macs today  
are much cheaper and mass produced at a much, much greater rate using  
many more standardized parts that simply don't hold up as well. For  
example, I don't think I ever had to replace a bad SCSI hard drive  
(only replaced because I needed a bigger one). I've had to replace a  
lot of ATA drives that have gone bad. I still have an old 13&quot; Apple  
brand monitor that still works (not that I'd want to use it), while  
I've had more recent CRT and LED displays that died.

Computers these days are built as cheaply as can reasonably be done,  
and it shows. Though I think Apple is still better than its  
competitors in that regard, that applies to them as well. I don't  
expect a $2000 computer to have the quality I expect in a $10,000  
computer.
