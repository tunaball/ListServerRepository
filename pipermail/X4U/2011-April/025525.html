<PRE>Dear list,
My thanks to all who responded. I would like to especially thank Randy  
Singer who taught me:
a: I was resetting my PMU all wrong
b. I needed to look at programs that are always running, even if I had  
not updated them in months....

The problem turned out to be one of those all running programs. (It  
was little snitch!)
Seems that even though I had not updated it in a month +, somehow, it  
was causing the machine to hang.
Force quitting it using activity monitor BEFORE restarting / shutting  
down prevented the hang.
But, before I could send a possible bug report to them, they came out  
with a version that says resolves this issue, even though the symptoms  
they reported I had not seen.
10+ restarts / shutdowns after installing the update and I have yet to  
experience the hang.

Ok, and resetting (properly) the PMU restored the &quot;zippiness&quot; I use to  
see when I ran Excel, but not recently.

Thank you Randy.

I do not believe I can ever repay you knowledge wise, but if and when  
we meet, I would like to buy you a drink of your choosing....

Lee

....With just Finder running, I hit the power button, or select from  
the menu, the option to restart / shutdown, and the process starts,  
the display changes to my background only, then my  computer hangs. ...
