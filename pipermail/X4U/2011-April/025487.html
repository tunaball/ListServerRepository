<PRE>Hi!

I tried searching this problem with Google w/o success.
I am running a 17&quot; G4 Mac, 10.5.8, all system software up to date less  
iTunes.
I have been having lots of problems when restarting / shutting down  
from my main account.
(I do not seem to have a problem with a virgin account that I create  
and test from , but since the problem is not always, I am not 100%  
sure.)
With just Finder running, I hit the power button, or select from the  
menu, the option to restart / shutdown, and the process starts, the  
display changes to my background only, then my  computer hangs. I have  
to hold the power button down for seconds to force the machine off.
I have reset PRAM, PMU, and NVRAM more than once.
I have removed and reinstalled both 1 GB memory modules more than once.
I have also removed all power, the battery, and held the power button  
down for more than 60 seconds (looked at my watch).
If I run &quot;Cocktail&quot; and have it automatically restart / shutdown, it  
USUALLY restarts / shutdowns but not always.
If I start up in single user mode and run &quot;AppleJack&quot; through all of  
its options, including deep clean, sometimes this fixes the problem  
for one or two cycles, but not permanently.
If I force quit Process Name &quot;loginwindow&quot; via Activity Monitor, all  
my programs running quit and my login window with my 3 accounts that I  
have all pops up and if I restart or  shutdown from this screen, I  
have never had a hang. I have deleted the preference file associated  
with this process but the problem remains.

During single user startup, I get the following two messages on the  
screen that seem to indicate a problem (from my system log):

&lt;localhost kernel[0]: Extension &quot;com.apple.driver.AppleMacRISC2PE&quot; has  
immediate dependencies on both com.apple.kernel and com.apple.kpi  
components; use only one style.?

and a little later:

&lt; localhost kernel[0]: Extension &quot;com.apple.driver.ApplePMU&quot; has  
immediate dependencies on both com.apple.kernel and com.apple.kpi  
components; use only one style.&gt;

So, using &quot;EasyFinder&quot; I search for invisible files and folders with a  
name &quot;apple.kernel&quot; and &quot;apple.kpi&quot; and there is NO &quot;apple.kpi&quot; file  
found but a system /library/cache folder with the name &quot;apple.kernel&quot;  
and  kext file with the same name are found. If I search for  
&quot;applePMU, I find a folder with the same name and a kext file with the  
same same in the same system /library/cache folder.

The creation date for the &quot;apple.kernel&quot; folder indicates that at some  
point in the last three days, it was created new but how, i do not  
know. Google search results tells me that I can safely delete this  
cache file and it will be recreated but since it is new, and the  
problem has been running for a time longer than it was created, I see  
no reason to delete it. And, per Google, deleting this problem seems  
to help solve a problem with &quot;dmg&quot; images not mounting, which I am not  
experiencing.

I have repaired disc permissions some many times it hurts, and I  
routinely see that some files have a &quot;locked disc permissions&quot; which i  
cannot ever seem to get repaired. I also see line items that says that  
an ACL was found which was unexpected, but have NOT a clue what that  
means, nor when I search for an ACL in the folder where the alert says  
one was found, I see nothing. (I am also looking at the invisible  
files and folders when i do this.)

I have done two clean installs on this Mac. the second one after  
reformatting my hard drive (60 GB, new in 2005, installed by Apple  
after the original one failed.). I reinstalled all that I wanted from  
original discs or images with the exception of Apple's Mail folder  
which I brought over the pref files and the email folders, just  
becausse I was too lasy to start that from scratch.

I am using &quot;istat menu.app&quot; and did notice the following in my console  
log:

&lt;iStat Menus exception in cpu - *** -[NSCFArray objectAtIndex:]: index  
(0) beyond bounds (0)
iStat Menus exception in cpu - setup module at index - 0 &gt;

But, I have been using this app (latest version I am on is 3.16) for  
years without this problem so since this is a recent problem, I am  
discounting it.

OK, this is long enough..

Any one have any ideas as I am plumb out of them.

Lee
