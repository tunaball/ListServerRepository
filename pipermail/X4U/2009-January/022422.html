<PRE>Thanks for your thoughtful reply David.  My responses follow yours  
below.  I'm still looking for recommendations on an 8-bay USB  
enclosure and a 4 or 8 port SATA controller, SATA hard drives, and an  
OS (maybe FreeNAS?).

</I>
I think a fan or power supply would be the most likely failure.  If  
the replacement isn't too expensive, I would do that instead of  
switching to a new Mac.  If the repair costs more than about $200 or  
is more difficult that popping in a PCI card or a RAM module, I would  
just buy a new USB enclosure.

&gt;<i> If you would replace with an iMac or Mac mini then you'd be stuck  
</I>&gt;<i> with SATA cards and drives.
</I>
I will still use the drives, that is the main investment.  Apple no  
longer makes any products with 8 bays.

&gt;<i> If you would replace it with Mac Pro, then your SATA cards would  
</I>&gt;<i> move across and your investment protected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In either case an external box would be ok. I wouldn't use USB  
</I>&gt;<i> though, especially with a slow G4. FW cards will continue to be  
</I>&gt;<i> available for Mac Pros, whatever Apple does. Read up on USB 3 before  
</I>&gt;<i> committing.
</I>
I don't think I've ever seen an 8-bay  enclosure for less than $1,000,  
except USB.

&gt;<i> You say you don't need RAID. Do you have a good way of backing up  
</I>&gt;<i> these extra drives (or are they the backup for other places)? If  
</I>&gt;<i> not, RAID 5 makes sense. (When will someone make an economical  
</I>&gt;<i> external RAID 5 box with 5 drives? It's the simplest, cheapest way  
</I>&gt;<i> to do RAID 5).
</I>
I'm planning to use a few drives as back-ups for my three primary  
Macs.  The other drives are for storage, but I plan to get an 8-bay  
USB drive to plug in once a week to back-up the storage and to have a  
second back-up for my primary Macs.  I don't consider RAID 5 to be a  
true back-up solution to itself because it doesn't help if the problem  
is data corruption, theft, lightning that destroys more than one  
drive, etc.  The back-up should be off-line most of the time.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If converting the G4 into a NAS makes sense, which SATA controller  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> card (inexpensive, Mac compatible and bootable), hard drives (low  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> heat)?  Should I run the Mac os or try Linux?  Thanks in advance.
</I>
