Neil:

I did something similar when I converted from OS2 to MAC 10 years  
ago. I also bought a program that would take MS Formated email to MAC  
mail when I converted. All in all its pretty painless when you find  
the right tool. One thing that I found daunting was to find the right  
MAC MAIL app preferences that converted MAC MAIL to any other email  
preferences. It can be done (I did it novice that I was at the time  
but ended up with a hand from a friend). All in all a pretty painless  
exercise. One thing that I still miss in MAC MAIL is that in EUDORA  
after closing the email message it automatically went to the next  
email. I really liked that feature and really sorely miss that  
functionality in MAIL.app. That is the major issue there are others  
of course, but I do like mail (most of the time) it is not exactly  
bullet proof but fairly stable none the less.

I finally had to ditch EUDORA as it was crashing on me several times  
a day (and taking OS9 along with it). The developers said that it was  
a &quot;known&quot; bug and it would require a complete redesign  of EUDORA to  
fix. It was around that time that EUDORA's future was bleak as they  
were talking about going to a yearly subscription cost. So that  
pretty well killed EUDORA for me.
