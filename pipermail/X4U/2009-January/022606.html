<PRE>
Does anybody happen to know how to uninstall the canon canoscan lide 90 
driver and mp Navigator package? I have a friend who accidentally deleted 
the mp navigator item, not from applications but from the Pictures folder. 
This didn't result in an immediate problem, and I thought the mp navigator 
package was not really njeeded if one is not using the mp navigator to 
scan and convert,  but eventually vuescan, which 
she is using, started complaining that she didn't have an Intel plugin and 
should go to the canon website to get it or use rosetta, which if I 
remember correctly is for running ppc programs on an intel mac. We tried 
just re-installing both the driver and the Navigator but that didn't work. 
I'm thinking she should just uninstall everything and re-install but there 
doesn't appear to be a utility for this. For the earlier Canon models 
there's an uninstall utility but not for this one. I suppose we could just 
try to use Spotlight and delete every instance but that doesn't seem very 
efficient. I know if I don't figure it out we might have to go to canon 
suport on this but I thought somebody might have an idea about this and I 
don't want to pay Canon $9.99 per incedent for support advice if I can 
help it.

Thanks.
