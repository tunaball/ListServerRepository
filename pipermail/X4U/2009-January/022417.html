<PRE>Since posting the below, I may have now identified the source of the 
problem. I usually have my iPhone with an active wifi connection 
sitting on the desk, or at least close by, when I'm at the computer. If 
I turn off the phone's wifi connection, my problem seems to go away. I 
was able to maintain my MacBook's connection for over an hour, but when 
I turned on my phone's connection, it dropped almost instantly. I 
turned the phone connection off, turned AirPort off and on again, and 
once again was not having a problem with my laptop's connection. Just 
to make sure it wasn't a coincidence, I repeated the test with the same 
results.

I hope Apple is able to address this soon with an update to either the 
iPhone firmware or OSX.
