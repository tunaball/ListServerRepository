Thanks for your suggestions. For the moment, however, I think I've 
identified the problem - my iPhone. Whenever I have the wifi turned on, 
I have these problems. If it's off, everything works normally. I'm not 
sure why it is happening, because my wife's phone doesn't interfere 
with my laptop's wifi connection, but it does. I've tested numerous 
times to ensure it wasn't just a coincidence, and it does seem to be 
the cause of my problem. I hope someone here can suggest what to do 
about it or that an update from Apple will address it.
