I would ship as new and as small (in capacity) drive as possible, 
encrypting the entire content.

Packaging needs to protect from shock and major damage. New bare 
drives are shipped in an anti-static bag, in a firm foam cradle that 
keeps the drive in the middle of a tough cardboard box that is 
significantly larger than the drive. The foam density is carefully 
designed for the job. If you were to buy a new drive of the same 
dimensions you would have the ideal packaging (as well as a backup 
drive). As it has data value as well as drive value I would then wrap 
the whole thing in bubble-wrap and bag or box the result.

If the journey would take it under the eyes of any security people 
who might suspect an encrypted disc, make sure your contact details 
are on a label on the anti-static bag. That way, if they suspect 
undesirable content, you're not hiding from them.
