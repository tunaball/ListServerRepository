<PRE>Two things there are hard wired routers that take cable to cable  
connections, usually have 4 to 5 outlets to connect to other computers  
printers. Wireless routers i.e. Apple Base Station do the same thing  
but with limitations.

 From the telco modem you usually can go directly to a hard wired  
router. Be sure you know what kind of cable is required. This is the  
hardest part and the one with the least directions. It usually is a Cat  
5E crossover cable. Now usually the Telco company will sell this with  
the modem, ouch a bit pricey). However, if you buy the modem and router  
from the telco this makes getting tech support answers a lot easier,  
because if you use another &quot;brand&quot; router, the telco will always blame  
it on the off brand router. When I got mine they put the wrong cable in  
the box. 2 days of pulling hair out, the guy on the phone asks read the  
color wires in the cable, because the color code was off he knew it was  
the wrong.
Luckily I had a cross over. In fact I had wire everywhere of every  
type, just in case


It is also possible you may be able to use the hard wired router by  
straight cat 5e to the G4 and the G4 then becomes the base station to  
get the signal to the iBook. Why the hard wired router, ability to hook  
up other devices that are not wireless.

To go from the hard wired router you need to research a bit more, it  
depends on which base station you use. From the router you can hook up  
to a Apple Base Station or other brands of wireless stations, usually  
cheaper but I try to buy Apple when they do not skin me on the cost.  
Again the type of cable used here is important and dependent on type of  
router and where it's used .
	
 From the hard wired router you can use straight cat 5e cable to hook up  
directly to  most macs by just plugging it in. Macs made from the the  
6100-8100 series and older had ethernet but was a bit different had to  
have a plug and play part, if you do not have anything that old not  
worth typing. Me I love my 6100 G3 300MHZ bought new in 1995 and runs  
15/7 and I only replace the pram 3 times, plus it lets me connect one  
of my printers a Select 360 a beast of a printer, but 10 years and  
still going

Again be sure you get the correct cables. This is the only real  
headache part. This will give you a wired set up that will let use hard  
wired or wireless.
I am looking at getting one of the older &quot;Snow Base Stations&quot; this has  
2 ethernet ports and wireless

I am sure minds smarter then mine will help more but that is the  
general flow. You can eliminate the hard wired router and go totally  
wireless. But I have found that the straight cat 5e is faster, and at  
times that matters and lets me hook up all sorts of good old products..

Go to Apples website and do a little more search for airport to see  
what's best for you.. They do a much better job of explaining things. I  
have noticed that the sight seems a little better then it used to be.  
Below is a good site that I sent someone else to
&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://search.info.apple.com/?">http://search.info.apple.com/?</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> q=Airport+&amp;search=Go&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;search=Go

Below is a quote from another list of this group 1st power mac

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
So save the money and find a used or inexpensive Base Station. The  
router that comes out from the telco modem is not always cheap,  
sometimes, free if you find the right ad. The hard wired routers, those  
are cheap
Good luck Geoff
