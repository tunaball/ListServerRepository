&gt;<i> Overall, I like Lion, but without a speck of doubt, Snow Leopard was more stable and well-behaved by orders of magnitude. It isn't that Lion spazzes out, it's that many things about Lion are simply quirky, broken, squirrelly. I've had to horse around with tech support with Lion-related issues far more than any other version of Mac OS, going all the way back to System 7!
</I>
Alternately I have not had any trouble at all with Lion. It installed perfectly OTA on top of SL and has run smoothly with never a single crash of any software, Apple or third party. I don't run any photo or video manipulation software, maintain several never used external HDD backups, never run Repair Permissions, I ran Disk Warrior once when it was upgraded to work with Lion just to ensure it works, I never tempt fate by running beta software and only run third party software which has been shown by other users' experiences to be compatible with Lion. In my view Lion has reached a very high level of evolution of OS self maintenance, for instance its own defrag, a cold reboot does a FSCK and auto run daily, weekly, monthly of cache clearing and other house keeping under the hood processes.

I am the Admin of a Help email list for my Apple User Group and most of our requests for help relate to pre Lion systems. Invariably any Lion users' problems come from third party clashes or crashes except for the unforseen RAM or HDD hardware hassles.

Having said that, everyone's experience may vary. 

I run an early 2008 iMac C2D 306 GHZ 6GB RAM OS X 10.7.4


&gt;<i> You may simply wish to stay put, and see how Mountain Lion users fare, especially those who do what you do with your machine.

I don't see how that will help him as any glitches which appear with ML will not be identifiable to the ordinary user as hangovers or still present in Lion.

To the OP: 4 GB RAM and 30-40GB free space, providing that is about 10-20 per cent of the total HDD will be sufficient. Take usual precautions: ensure all current software and system running smoothly, ensure all critical software is compatible with/can be upgraded to Lion, have adequate backup either TimeMachine or clone. I am confident you will find Lion faster than Snow Leopard. In my view Lion 10.7.4 has had all the bugs which may have appeared in 10.7 now worked out.
