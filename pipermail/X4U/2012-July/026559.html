&gt;<i> Cat, can you (re-) state what specific issues you've had with Lion after a clean install? Perhaps we can get helpful responses...

Certainly. 

While I agree that we don't need another stinky conflict, I don't appreciate the almost knee-jerk push-back that often follows a person saying that they had a less-than-good experience with Mac hardware and software.

I have had some UI glitches such as persistent &quot;Quickview&quot; item after mousing over items shown by Spotlight. Let's say it's a document which you then see the Quickview of...sometimes that simply never goes away, even after you mouse away, and the Spotlight dropdown menu vanishes...that quickview preview just hangs there and only logging out and back in resolves it.

Mission Control and Launchpad. I won't argue whether or not people &quot;like&quot; these features or not. They are simply broken. Mission control loses/breaks the relationships between app and space to which it is assigned. This happened rarely, if at all, in Snow Leopard.  Launchpad, you can set up how you like, but when you restart your Mac, your Launchpad arrangement is all re-arranged.

in *my* opinion, both of these features could be extremely useful, but they are so hosed that I stopped using them.

Perhaps the most serious problem I've had with Lion is with the mail app. I love OS X Mail. But Lion's Mail.app got my mailcount wrong. I use IMAP. and tho Lion mail &quot;knew&quot; how many emails there should be on the server, it would only display some of them.

Contrast this to an install of Snow Leopard on a different partition, Tiger on a G4 Mini and Panther on a Pismo, all of which got the mail count right. Thunderbird on Snow, Tiger and Lion got the mail count right. Lion Mail.app simply couldn't.

You might say that Mail is not OS X and I'll not get balled up in that debate. Mail.app comes with OS X and is ostensibly well-integrated with the OS in a variety of ways.

Make suggestions about these if you like. I have gone to the ends of the earth with apple tech support and others to try to solve them and there simply were no solutions to the problems I've listed. I spent *so* much time with tech support on these, in fact, that one Senior Advisor sent me a free iPod nano to sort of make up for the many hours I'd invested in the problem.\

I must have clean-installed Lion on my Mac Pro at least 5 separate times. So, I feel I've been there and back with Lion issues.

I've read scores of comments from people who say &quot;I don't have that problem,&quot; as though this means that I should not have it either. I would be tickled insane not to have had these problems. Yet, here I am.

Extensive, exhaustive, repeated technical examination of my hardware by me, tech support and authorized apple techs revealed no problems.

I spend all my time in Lion, and have so for the best part of the past year. The sun didn't explode. No fatalities resulted.

But think back on what the OP asked...he wanted to know whether he'd be in for a world of hurt should he upgrade to Lion. In the experience that I had, if I'd to do it again, I would have stayed put with Snow Leopard, regardless of how problem-free Lion might be for others.

that first taste of mail counts being wrong would be enough to go back to snow at warp 9. Accurate mail counts are simply too important...what if you miss just 1 email leading to a job or new client? 

I think that we are all justifiably confident in Mac OS. In my 25 years using the platform, this Lion experience is really the only serious problem I've ever had. I feel that Lion needs more time in the oven. I'm not the only one having the issues I described.

This isn't black magic. It's stuff made by the human mind, which is imperfect itself, therefore how realistic to expect its products to be perfect.

25 years and 1 clunker isn't too shabby a record, IMHO.

thank you!
