Except...misleading others is exactly what you did.  It  is  
absolutely true that many folks had problems when they upgraded to  
Lion.  But they didn't have *your* problems.  And the types of  
problems that other folks had could be cured by a clean install.  If  
you choose to tell folks that they will be &quot;in a world of hurt&quot; if  
they upgrade to Lion, it is indeed your responsibility to show that  
other users have experienced the same sort of problems you have.   
They haven't.  Your assertion is baseless.  At most you can say that  
*you* had a really bad experience with Lion, but you can't point to  
anyone who has had the exact same experience.

Also, it now also sounds like you had very similar problems while  
running Snow Leopard.  Hence by wild guess that you are experiencing  
hardware problems.  Hardware problems are often made worse when  
upgrading to a new version of the OS, because of the strain caused by  
the upgrade process.

If you had a good experience with Snow Leopard, I would have wondered  
why you didn't just downgrade:

How to Switch Back from Lion to Snow Leopard
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/">http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/</A> 
how_switch_back_lion_snow_leopard&gt;

Finally, I see that you feel like I went too far by the fact that I  
said that you &quot;mislead&quot; users.  Actually, that language is quite a  
bit toned down.  This is a Macintosh support list.  Giving out wrong  
information on a support list, in my mind, is, shall we say, not at  
all a nice thing to do.  I understand that you are frustrated by your  
personal experience, and I understand that you might be angry with  
Apple, but that isn't a reasonable basis for giving out bad  
information here.
