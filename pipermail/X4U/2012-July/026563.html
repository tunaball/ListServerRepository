<PRE>Randy;

I have to be frank with you. I think that you have a problem with needing to be &quot;right&quot; about everything.

I am personally done with you.

Your accusing me of dishonesty was crossing the line; your pursuing and persisting in this is now *way* out of line.

I leave you to yourself, and I want no more of this discussion with you.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I hate to add yet one more email to the pile in this conversation, but I don't appreciate your either implying or flat out stating that I am misleading users. It's baseless, inflammatory and non-sequitor relative to what I have actually said.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The OP asked a question about whether Lion would work for him or not. Some have positive Lion experiences, others have some negative ones. A fair airing of both sides is no skin off anybody's nose.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I welcome your disagreeing with me, Randy, but *please* next time, select an adjective other than &quot;misleading&quot; to describe positions you disagree with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Except...misleading others is exactly what you did.  It  is absolutely true that many folks had problems when they upgraded to Lion.  But they didn't have *your* problems.  And the types of problems that other folks had could be cured by a clean install.  If you choose to tell folks that they will be &quot;in a world of hurt&quot; if they upgrade to Lion, it is indeed your responsibility to show that other users have experienced the same sort of problems you have.  They haven't.  Your assertion is baseless.  At most you can say that *you* had a really bad experience with Lion, but you can't point to anyone who has had the exact same experience.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, it now also sounds like you had very similar problems while running Snow Leopard.  Hence by wild guess that you are experiencing hardware problems.  Hardware problems are often made worse when upgrading to a new version of the OS, because of the strain caused by the upgrade process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you had a good experience with Snow Leopard, I would have wondered why you didn't just downgrade:

</I>&gt;<i> How to Switch Back from Lion to Snow Leopard

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I see that you feel like I went too far by the fact that I said that you &quot;mislead&quot; users.  Actually, that language is quite a bit toned down.  This is a Macintosh support list.  Giving out wrong information on a support list, in my mind, is, shall we say, not at all a nice thing to do.  I understand that you are frustrated by your personal experience, and I understand that you might be angry with Apple, but that isn't a reasonable basis for giving out bad information here.
