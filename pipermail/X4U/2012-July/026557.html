I'm not an Apple fanboy.  I'm happy to criticize Apple when they  
deserve it, and they have justly deserved it many times in the past.

But I'm not in favor of misleading users either.  Unless you can  
point to other users having the same issues you are having (and there  
are plenty of public forums to refer to where users recount their  
problems), then clearly the issues that you are experiencing are  
unique to your individual Macintosh.  Apple (and to be fair, just  
about any manufacturer) does occasionally produce a computer here and  
there that is a lemon, and any computer, including any Mac, can fail,  
sometimes mysteriously.

But just because your computer is having a problem, and that problem  
manifested itself after you upgraded to Lion, doesn't mean that users  
are commonly having problems with Lion.  There would have to be other  
examples to point to to say that is the case.  I haven't heard of  
them, and I'm in touch with an awful lot of Mac users.  But I'm open  
to being educated.  Is there, for instance, a thread on Apple's  
discussion forums where lots of folks are experiencing the same  
problems you are?

You say that you have had Apple attempt to fix your problems several  
times.  Are you aware that Apple has a policy of replacing your Mac  
if they have tried to fix it three times and fail?  Have you tried  
contacting Customer Relations (NOT Technical Support or AppleCare)?   
Customer Relations is set up to help users with unusual, or unusually  
vexing problems that Technical Support can't help with.  Call:
1-800-275-2273 and ask for &quot;customer relations.&quot;
