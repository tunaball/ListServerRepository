Honestly, I never intended to insinuate that &quot;catsoul&quot; was dishonest  
or a liar.

It's just that I don't know of anyone, anywhere, who has claimed that  
&quot;parts of Lion are broken&quot; and the other things that &quot;catsoul&quot;  
claimed were common problems among Lion users.  Lots of folks have  
had problems with Lion.  But not those problems.  If &quot;catsoul&quot; can't  
point to even one person, anywhere, that is having the same problems  
(not different problems), my concern was genuinely that he was  
misleading other users with unsupported claims that other users were  
having the same problems.  (Note that I am not refuting that *he* has  
had the problems that he is claiming to have.)

I still l haven't seen even a single link to anywhere where anyone  
else has said that they are having the identical problems.  And as I  
said previously, I'm willing to be educated.  There may be a bunch of  
posts about this somewhere that I missed.
