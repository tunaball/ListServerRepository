While it is true that many folks had issues with Lion, you are the first who has reported problems after doing a clean install.  (That is, instability or features that don't work.  Plenty of users are unhappy with some of the new features, but those aren't defects.)  My guess is that at this point you have a hardware problem that is causing your difficulties, not a software problem. A wild guess would be that you have out of spec or failing RAM.

Honestly, we don't need yet another thread to escalate into unnecessary attacks.

To be clear, I think nobody on this list, including Randy, is claiming that Lion is &quot;issue-free&quot;.

Cat, can you (re-) state what specific issues you've had with Lion after a clean install? Perhaps we can get helpful responses...

Enjoy,

Jim
