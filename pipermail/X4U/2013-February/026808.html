</I>&gt;<i> I strongly urge you to purchase the 3-year AppleCare if you are going to
</I>purchase a new iMac. I've bought 4 iMacs new since the current flat panel
design debuted with the white G5 models, and I bought AppleCare with each
one. The white 20-inch G5 bought in May 2005 and developed the white-line
at the bottom of the screen issue so familiar to that model. AppleCare
replaced the LCD 5 times, and the logic board 1 time before offering me a
current-model replacement in October 2007. I paid extra to upgrade the
specs of the mid-2007 aluminum 20-inch iMac and bought AppleCare. I've
still got that iMac, which will run everything from OS X 10.4.4 to OS X
10.8.2. The only problem it's ever had was a hard drive that started
failing; AppleCare replaced it in two days. I bought a new late-2009
27-inch iMac the day they came out that October, as well as AppleCare.
After about a year of seeing some yellow tinting come and go, the screen
began to develop a watermark along the righthand side. The watermark
finally got so annoying I reported it to AppleCare, and the LCD was
replaced in a couple of days at no charge to me. I've also had a bluetooth
keyboard replaced under AppleCare. My current late-2012 27-inch iMac is
covered under AppleCare just in case something goes haywire in the first 3
years. Since this new beauty has a laminated LCD that's glued to the
aluminum frame with automotive-glass-type sticky stuff, I'm very happy to
pay in advance for peace of mind for the next 3 years.

On the other hand, I haven't bought AppleCare for my iOS devices (multiple
iPhones, iPads and iPods) and have not regretted that move at all.
