I always perceived the admin's job as being actively &amp; constructively 
involved in policy-making, because of his or her technical ability to 
understand the issues relevant to that policy.

I'm so glad I'm no longer employed by dumbasses. Now I'm self-employed 
I mostly just refuse to do stupid stuff like this, explaining to the 
customer a better way of doing things.

When you thrust working practices which you're unable to justify upon 
employees they just end up resenting you for it - in my experience 
stupid, unnecessary &amp; inflexible rules seem just petty to those they're 
imposed upon, and are a significant cause of dissatisfaction in the 
workplace. You might consider this to be &quot;not your problem&quot; and that of 
your company, but unless you as a sys-admin can either give a reason 
for this policy or turn around and tell your policy-maker this is a 
stupid rule, then you're simply perpetuating the aggravation upon your 
colleagues.

&gt;<i>  so I guess then that there is no log to monitor this?
</I>
Possibly - it should be able to tell you times of file reads &amp; writes, 
but how do you tell the difference between a file being read off the 
server directly into an application and it being copied onto a local 
drive? How do you determine the difference between the application 
writing a changed file to the server and Finder on the client machine 
copying back the completed item?

In the former case the application should be kept open by the server, 
but I don't know if this will be recorded in the log - try having a 
poke in /var/log (`open /var/log` in the terminal window). Before you 
waste time doing so please find out the justification for this rule or 
just consider how popular you're gonna be when your boss tells your 
colleague &quot;you're getting a verbal warning because Wayne says you've 
been breaking this dumb rule that we have for no reason&quot;.

Stroller.
