It's a little strange. They received their Apple Reseller  
certification about two weeks ago and instantly set up a display of  
iMacs and MacBooks. However, I'm told that due to people being on  
holiday Apple Canada doesn't have anyone available to train the sales  
staff until two weeks from now. I asked and not one of them had  
visited Apple's web site to inform themselves on the products they  
sell. I was told that they've already sold one iMac and three  
MacBooks. The iMac and two of the MacBooks were to previous Mac users  
who knew what they wanted when they came in. The third MacBook was  
sold to someone who needs a Windows XP laptop but wanted a Mac  
because they know the hardware is build better. They have no  
intention of ever using OSX on it. I gave the store owner my card and  
told him to call me if they have any questions regarding Macs. I've  
worked on Macs since the Mac Plus and I've owned one or another ever  
since the LCII came out.
