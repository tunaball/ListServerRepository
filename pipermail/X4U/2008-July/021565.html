<PRE>Hi all,

I was browsing a local computer store that just became an authorized  
Apple dealer. While taking the time to instruct the sales people on  
how to use a Mac (and these people are suppose to be the ones  
promoting it) I got around to showing them Dashboard and the Widgets  
installed. I activated one Widget for movies and after configuring it  
for our city, it showed the movie listings for the cinemas in our  
area. The sales people were very impressed. Secretly I was impressed  
as well although I didn't let it show. I'm using Tiger and that was  
my first time trying Leopard. I've read enough about it and watched  
enough videos about it that I had no problem show off features like  
Spaces even though I had never actually tried them before.

Anyway, As I said I'm still using Tiger. I really liked that Movie  
Widget that comes with Leopard and was wondering if it's usable in  
Tiger? I went to Apple's Widget download page and found several movie  
related Widgets but I couldn't find that particular one. Does anyone  
know if it's available for download anywhere? Or even better, can  
someone using Leopard send it to me off list?

Thanks

Mark
