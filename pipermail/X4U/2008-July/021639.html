That's good to know, it will aid in where I'm headed with my 
Databases, though right now they exist in either FileMaker Pro 5.5 or 
Oracle RDB (on OpenVMS, and not the Oracle DB you're probably 
thinking of).  I should be able to move the Oracle RDB data to MySQL 
easy enough with a little Perl programming.

I don't supposed this makes FileMaker Pro 9 a bit like MS SQL Studio 
is for SQL Server?  I'll definitely need to read up on that, and 
maybe start saving up for a copy.  Sadly unlike when I went from 2.1 
to 5.5 I won't be able to simply upgrade, I'll have to buy a new 
copy. :^(

&gt;<i>As for Clarisdraw, ever thought

</I>
I have a Wacom tablet (actually it is my second).  Though I haven't 
had Painter since my first tablet (close to 10 years ago).  For what 
I like using ClarisDraw for I've been meaning to try out a CAD 
package or two.  In fact the MS-DOS apps I used on the PC prior to 
switching to ClarisDraw on the Mac was a couple very early versions 
of DesignCAD, and some tool for making forms.  At least I can use 
Intaglio to open my ClarisDraw apps and convert them over to another 
format.

I've lost track of how many ClarisDraw replacements people here have 
suggested and I've tried, and so far they all fall short. :^( 
Ideally I'd like to move to Adobe Illustrator, especially since it is 
part of CS3 Premium, but I really don't &quot;get&quot; Illustrator.  I've 
largely resigned myself to either running it on my G4/450AGP or else 
via emulation under something like SheepShaver.
