</I>
The 4 backup drives are as follows:
CD Burner
1 Terabyte backup drive (its actually 2 500 GB drives but I am using  
it as a RAID 0 so I can have a cheap terabyte worth.
1 400 GB drive for not frequently used apps
1 300 GB drive for videos

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At my company, the guy who makes all our major corporate films  
</I>&gt;<i> works on a Mac Pro with four internal terabyte drives, two 30-inch  
</I>&gt;<i> screens and 32 GB of RAM and is able to render long movies very  
</I>&gt;<i> fast and continue working on other projects.  What are you doing on  
</I>&gt;<i> your computer that requires more than 32 GB of RAM?  I am able to  
</I>&gt;<i> run my iMac with Photoshop and email and internet and assorted  
</I>&gt;<i> background programs, and Excel, all at the same time, and sometimes  
</I>&gt;<i> more, like VMWare Fusion, with 3 (three) Gb of RAM!
</I>
I am running the finder, address book, Itunes, Hogwasher, quicktime,  
dictionary (websters), Ivisit, weather app, betterfinder renamer,  
Safari, mail app, iorganize, graphic converter , hogwasher activity   
monitor, timbukto pro, Boinc (2 sub applications), Net monitor,  
Iweather, Preview. Plus some other apps that do not show up on the  
dock. Like I said nothing extraordinary just apps that I use either  
continuously or run in the background that I need once an hour or so.  
There are other apps of course I did not count the ones that I use  
only once a day like Word Perfect and some games that I use rather  
infrequently (once or twice a month at most) . I am still paging  
quite a bit for essentially running very little, IMO. Not to run on  
but in OS2 I had 4GB and ran a LOT more and faster with a way slower  
system (currently I have dual G5 2.7Ghz) with OS/2 I had a 100Mhz  
pentium).  I need Timbukto pro because I run into issue with the MAC  
os that I have a friend take over my system so he can diagnose the  
issue so he doesn't have to come over to my place. It turns out that  
its been a lifesaver on many occasions  and saved a reboot.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd really be interested to know what processes would require that  
</I>&gt;<i> much RAM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Daly
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>ps: I did not capitalize a lot of apps so don't even try and go there.
