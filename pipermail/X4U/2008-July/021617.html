Ed,
I see you're actually running a PowerMac G5 dual 2.7Ghz, and not a 
Mac Pro.  You don't mention the size of your two internal drives, but 
I suspect that with a Mac Pro you could take everything internal. 
Remember the Mac Pro handles 4 internal HD's, and 1.5TB drives are 
just coming out.

This doesn't make sense.  On a 100Mhz Pentium you would be limited to 
something between 16 to 128 Megabytes RAM, maybe as much as 256 
Megabytes, but I sure don't see it handling 4 Gigabytes of RAM as the 
chipsets didn't support that much RAM.  As for your current system, 
of the applications you're running Hogwasher and Safari look to be 
the only two that will use significant amounts of RAM.  I fail to see 
how you could need more than 32 Gigabytes of RAM with that light of a 
load.  I'm running with 5.5 Gigabytes of RAM, and only feel stressed 
when doing something like trying to process and review 760 12MP RAW 
photo's.  How much RAM does your current system actually have?  Do 
any of the G5's go above 8 Gigabytes RAM?  Check &quot;About this Mac&quot; 
under the Apple menu.  The current Mac Pro's would definitely give 
you the ability to have more RAM than you currently have.

Secondly, how does moving from 10.4 to 10.5 prevent you from running 
Word Perfect?  You shouldn't be able to run it on either, except 
under 3rd party emulation.  It won't run under Classic will it?  How 
would a modern version of Word Perfect work for you?  You could 
always run it under Windows on a Mac Pro.
