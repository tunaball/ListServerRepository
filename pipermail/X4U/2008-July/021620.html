<PRE>Ed . . .

While I haven't looked at your machine . . . I'm guessing that either  
you have a hardware problem causing your issues, or you have some  
piece of software that is not compatible, or you have a corrupted  
preference/third party add on/whatever that is causing your issues.

Your list of apps is not that large (although I did notice that you  
appear to have two weather applications running) but a properly  
installed Leopard on a machine that does not have a hardware issue is  
pretty stable. Leopard is find running plenty of apps on my MacBook  
Pro with 3 GB or RAM.

At the moment I have Mail, Firefox, Finder, TextEdit, Preview,  
Photoshop Elements 6, System Preferences, LaunchBar, Terminal, and  
1Password running. Background processes include WeatherPop, iMonTime,  
SlimBatteryMonitor, LIttle Snitch, MenuMeters, iStatMenus, Mozy,  
Awaken, FinderPop, MainMenu, MissingSyncMonitor, Synchronize Pro X,  
Airport Base Station Agent, FontExplorerXAutoload, and Magical. (not  
trying to one-up you on the application list; that's just my normal  
set of login utilities and the apps I happen to be running right now).

If you're having issues with as much RAM as you have then . . . it is  
most likely not Leopard; but one of those things I mentioned in the  
first paragraph. I feel for you . . . particularly if it's an  
intermittent hardware problem. My guess is that you've an old version  
of some software or else a corrupted preference file or something.
