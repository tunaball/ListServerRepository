I am going to add and after this I will stay out of the discussion.  
That at times when a subject matter because very complicated that it  
is important to leave a lot of what you are responding to. I have  
seen discussion veer off into never ending side discussion because  
one or more of the commenter(s) either did not read (and remember)  
what has been previously posted. Having said that there are  
reasonable limits in most discussions and a &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;NO&quot; is sufficient  
but at times it is not (IMO) and it is *important* to show most of  
the previous discussion. The &quot;times&quot; being a technical discussion  
which always needs to have previous entries. I have also seen where  
quite a few people (not on this list but on other lists) have a basic  
misunderstanding in how something works. When you chop off the  
discussion people do not learn from what others have said. I know  
that is a class room discussion but since we are not in a classroom  
environment here it is important not to delete what others have said,  
IMO.

Over and out.

Ed
