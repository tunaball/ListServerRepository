Not going to happen they still have not released two posts of mine  
from a week ago that are being held because they were to long. I even  
wrote asking them and did not even get a courtesy of a reply saying  
at least yes./no so if they don't reply to a *NICE* request I sure  
won't apologize for something I didn't do it was the listserv and how  
the list mom set it up so either they should apologize or at least  
reject it with an explaination.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the download window goes into the background and is hidden from my  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> view. Even if I switch back to Safari the download window stays  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hidden. I *think* the control command Option might help but today  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have not gotten any emails with file instructions to download so

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before I use it. I may have to set up a PFK key to do the sequence  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as my memory is not great.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, or write it on a yellow sticky and put it on your monitor  
</I>&gt;<i> until you get used to it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is a &quot;PFK key&quot;? You mean a memorized keyboard sequence that  
</I>&gt;<i> gets played back? If so, what program or utility do you use for  
</I>&gt;<i> that? I've been looking for a good one.
</I>
Sorry I use the the term PFK to mean function key. In my past  
history  PFK meant Program Function Key in the MAC world its just  
called Function Key Its basically the same but where I come each  
application can &quot;own&quot; those keys and for each application it means  
different things. To try and further illustrate say a word processing  
program is running and its programmed to understand that when (your  
terminology) say F1 (function key 1) is depressed it means that in  
that word processing what ever pre programmed action occurs when it  
is depressed (say skip two lines or whatever) or when say a terminal  
application is in control and the F1 is pushed it may hang up the  
phone. It is basically tells the application to do any preprogrammed  
set of operation(s).
