I will agree with the better, I felt that the change to Intel should 
have occurred with the change to Mac OS X, or at least shortly after. 
Finally we're not stuck with CPU's playing catchup except for the 
occasional leap in performance.

</I>&gt;<i>Another fact that you are going to have to face is that new software will

</I>&gt;<i>Office 2004 will run but Office 2008 is a Universal Binary Release.
</I>&gt;<i>Photoshop 7 will not run but Photoshop CS3 will.  Mail is pretty good as a

</I>&gt;<i>features now.  I use Dreamweaver CS3, Flash CS3 and Fireworks CS3 for web
</I>&gt;<i>design--all run well on the Intel Mac.
</I>
This is just what I've been doing, concentrating on upgrading to 
software that has Universal binaries.  Looking at the software I run, 
I have almost everything converted to Universal binaries.  I'm 
running Office 2008, Adobe Creative Suite 3 Premium, Adobe Lightroom 
(upgrading to 2.0 as soon as its released), iLife '08.  The only 
non-Mac OS X app I care about running is ClarisDraw, and I keep 
trying to get off of it, and keep failing.  I think the last things 
to upgrade are FileMaker Pro and Toast.  I'm not sure I'll bother 
with FileMaker Pro (might move to MySQL), but will get Toast, though 
I'll probably do that the same day when I eventually buy my new Mac 
Pro.  This is a lot better than when I made the jump to Mac OS X, and 
then had to buy all new versions of my software.

I did just realize one application that isn't Universal, and that is 
Eudora, but it will run under Rosetta.  I'm anxiously watching for an 
email reader that can replace Eudora, there are a couple of hopeful 
replacements being worked on.  Trust me Mail.app can't handle my mail 
load, I've tried using it for some administrative accounts for a 
couple servers, and it's fallen flat on its face.

&gt;<i>Another major perk with the Intel Macs is that you can run Windows DECENTLY
</I>&gt;<i>via emulation software and using Bootcamp, you can run it natively.  If
</I>&gt;<i>you're into gaming, this is a big PLUS for me as the best games come out for
</I>&gt;<i>Windows and not the Mac.
</I>&gt;<i>The future is clear.  Move up to Intel or be left in the dust...the choice
</I>&gt;<i>is yours.
</I>
As near as I can tell, my future is a Mac Pro, running ClarisDraw and 
a few others under SheepShaver.  The other stuff being games such as 
the original &quot;Master of Orion&quot; and &quot;Warlords 2&quot;.  The original 68k 
Mac versions were far better than their MS DOS counterparts.

The ability to run Windows and Linux on the same hardware will be a 
major plus for me.

I don't mind loosing my Classic apps when I move to Intel, I mind 
loosing them when moving from the 2nd to the last, to the last 
version of Mac OS X to support my G5.
