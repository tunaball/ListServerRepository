10.5.4 appears to be stable, that I will agree to. 10.5 (.0, .1, .2,  
and .3) were an exercise in frustration. I have had the 'pleasure' of  
removing Leopard from almost as many machines as I've installed it  
onto. I've even removed Leopard and installed Tiger on brand new  
hardware. Some love Leopard, many despise it. The more experienced a  
user is, the less likely they are to like Leopard.

As an example of Leopard's instability, my personal MacBook Pro CD 15&quot;  
was rock solid under Tiger. I cloned it and then erased the drive and  
did a clean install of Leopard. I experienced kernel panics for the  
first time on this machine! App crashes were also common, even Apple  
apps. Multiple fresh installs, combo updates, etc never helped. I'm  
glad I had my clone of Tiger available so I could work. Eventually I  
migrated my data to Leopard, but it wasn't until the latest update  
that stability came to the OS and many of the apps. I had 3 Apple apps  
crash on me yesterday. And this isn't 'kvetching', it is my experience!

Don't even mention Leopard Server. It is disgraceful that Apple  
required payment for it. Even with the latest updates it is still a  
mess. And Apple's server tools are a joke. I know 2 companies who  
demanded and received full refunds from Apple for Leopard Server. They  
are both back to running Tiger server. That said, I also know others  
who are quite happy with Leopard server...

&gt;&gt;<i> From what I've been reading, an EFI motherboard is available in

</I>&gt;<i> now and will be here within a few months.  Buy the motherboard, an  
</I>&gt;<i> Apple
</I>&gt;<i> compatible video card and the mid-range tower of your choice and  
</I>&gt;<i> your desire

</I>

Building a &quot;Hackintosh&quot; isn't for the average Mac user. I've done it  
and it was a frustrating exercise of multiple installs until I was  
able to find the right combination of drivers to have a stable system.  
And once it is built and running, turn off software update! Not the  
typical &quot;Mac&quot; experience.

I have a number of clients who would love to buy a mid-range tower.  
They have been delaying purchasing new equipment because of Leopard  
(they are quite happy with Tiger and their current software, thank  
you!) and because they don't like the current iMac's. Simply put, the  
iMac is too difficult to upgrade/enhance or eventually repair. The  
Mini isn't enough machine, and the Mac Pro's are too big, too  
expensive, and potentially too loud for them. Notebooks are not  
suitable for their workflow. They are looking for a machine that  
resembles the spec of the G3/G4 towers. 2 or 3 HD bays, 1 optical  
drive, optional WiFi and Bluetooth, USB2 and Firewire 800, Gigabit  
ethernet, a replaceable video card and a few expansion slots. And make  
it relatively small and quiet!

No company or product is perfect, but that shouldn't stop us from  
demanding perfection!
