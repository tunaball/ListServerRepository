I just love how many people here automatically assume it's something 
something I've installed on the system.  I don't install funky 3rd 
party OS extensions.

It about as close to a stock system as you can get.
MacBook 2Ghz
2Gb RAM
Stock HD
Mac OS X 10.5.3
iLife '08
I think the only 3rd party app installed is MS Office 2004

10.5.0 was seriously unstable on this system, it slowly got better, 
as as far as we know 10.5.3 hasn't crashed.  (if it has our son 
hasn't told us)  Basically the only app our son can run is Safari, 
and he's limited to a few children's sites, yet logging out was 
crashing the system.  That tells me there is/was a problem with 
Safari and some websites.

Now my G5 2x2 w/5.5GB RAM is always seriously overloaded, often the 
HD's are borderline full, I'm running 10.4.11, and yet the only thing 
that crashes it is Virtual PC.  I'm well aware of what the problem 
is, it is that I have 2 2GB Kingston matched PC3200 kits that aren't 
&quot;Mac&quot; memory.  For some reason the system is rock solid except when 
running VPC.  I can live without VPC.

As many/most here know, stability concerns are only half of what has 
kept me on 10.4.11, the other issue is the fact 10.5 can't run 
classic software.  Considering they're apparently dropping PPC 
support altogether with 10.6, they really should have left that in 
10.5.
