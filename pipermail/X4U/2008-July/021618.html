Zane:

I have lets plenty of experience running with software that lets say  
makes the OS do things that that it wasn't meant to do or bypass an  
OS function which was designed to protect yourself against yourself.   
It is not pretty to say the least. Vendor(s) will not talk with you  
unless you remove the FOREIGN software while they run or to even have  
it on the system. They plain out refuse to entertain any problems you  
might have. In my case I have at least two really bad application  
that basically barely function properly on a unmodified MAC OS. If I  
were to toss in the foreign software you are talking about I would  
get ZERO support from either vendor. The two applications that I have  
the most issue with are ones that I seem to be the only person to  
have issues with except the last &quot;bug&quot; which I was finally able to  
guide the author to the right area of the code for him to figure out  
what the problem was. But it took several months of sending in  
problem reports to. The other is an application that as far as I can  
figure out the author has does not take any problem reports and if  
forced to he does nothing with them.

I am also stuck at the (because of budget issue) on my current  
hardware, essentially forever. If I would have known Apple was going  
to pull the switch on my system I would not have bought it.

The only thing I can say nice about OS X is that it doesn't crash as  
much as OS9 did. I think giving up Eudora caused my system to become  
semi stable. Switching to OS X (several different versions) have  
really not helped all that much. OS9 to me was nothing more than a  
windows machine as it crashed daily (or more).

I am *NOT* a windows fan at all. I had to work on it and it crashed  
as much as OS/9 did which was daily or several times a day. I almost  
had a &quot;I am mad as hell and I am not going to take it anymore&quot; with  
the windows machine. I had to endure it one other time and it was  
just plain ugly. To be fair the machine was a lap top  and I hate lap  
tops.

I am putting myself in a position I know but I suppose if I were ever  
to get another machine it would be a linux machine or something else  
other than Apple.

Color me an unhappy Apple person because of software (app and OS)  
issues and hardware issues.
