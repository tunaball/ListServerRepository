My wife is running it on a 2Ghz Core 2 Duo MacBook with 2GB RAM.  Up 
until 10.5.3 it would crash regularly on my son either while using 
Safari, or logging out.  I'm nearing the point I'll be willing to 
upgrade to 10.5, though as it stands now, I might simply wait until I 
upgrade to a Mac Pro (hopefully early next year).

</I>
This sounds like a firmware problem on the card, I had the same issue 
with a Narrow SCSI card in my Rev.0 PowerMac G4/450 AGP.

&gt;<i>The improvements in recent software has made using the iPhone G3 a pleasure.

</I>
I can somewhat understand the storage, though it sounds like in Ed's 
case, some HD upgrades would largely solve that issue.  I know that 
since buying a Nikon D300, and shooting everything in RAW 12MP I'm 
chewing through diskspace at a nice rate.   I can't understand the 
128GB of RAM.  Photoshop can't even address that much yet.

&gt;<i>  &gt;From what I've been reading, an EFI motherboard is available in Europe right

That sounds interesting, although I don't mind spending the 
additional money on quality *SUPPORTED* hardware from Apple.
