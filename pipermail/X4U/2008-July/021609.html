</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The software that comes bundled with the OS is average at best. Mail

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so-so at best the address book is another ho-hum. Safari is average
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but starting to go up, IMO.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still pissed about Mail.app, as I think it helped kill Eudora,
</I>&gt;<i> yet I'm typing this in Eudora as Mail.app can't handle my email load.
</I>&gt;<i> It can't even handle the two Admin accounts I use it for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The number of fixes, IMO is too high. Someone isn't testing as well

</I>&gt;<i> 10.5 was a disgrace, I think with 10.5.3 my wife's MacBook might

</I>&gt;<i> unstable system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Zane
</I>Zane:
I'm running 10.5.4 on a Mac Pro, a 17 inch MacBook Pro and a 15 inch MacBook
Pro.  It is stable.  It has been stable since the original release.  All of
those people kvetching about instability were probably running it on G4s--or
even, GASP, G3s.  I've also been hearing about people who are trying to run
it on Macs that don't meet the minimum requirements (867 G4 is the minimum),
that's where all these complaints of instability come from.  A bunch of
posters on the list complain about instability and all of a sudden it's a
fact?  In my opinion (you know what they say about those) 10.5 was designed
for Intel Macs and G5s.  I know for a fact that it improved my
father-in-law's G5 dual 1 gig.  He had a USB PCI card installed and I
suspected that it was the culprit that would not allow it to sleep.  If it
was allowed to sleep, it would not wake up without a hard re-boot.  After
upgrading to 10.5.4, the problem is gone--I kept telling him to try it but
he's 73 and doesn't like 'change'.  Now, he thanks me.
The improvements in recent software has made using the iPhone G3 a pleasure.
I agree with you in regard to 128 gig of RAM, who could possibly use that
unless it's some type of Major Graphics Workhorse--even then I'm not sure
that 128 is necessary.  As for storage, you can Max out a Mac Pro with 4
terabytes.  I guess some people have a need to store everything and anything
they've ever come in contact with since birth?
&gt;<i>From what I've been reading, an EFI motherboard is available in Europe right
</I>now and will be here within a few months.  Buy the motherboard, an Apple
compatible video card and the mid-range tower of your choice and your desire
will be a reality.  With what's happening with Pystar, I think the best
choice is to build it yourself.  The likelihood of Apple going after an
individual is remote.
