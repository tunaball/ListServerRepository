That was with 10.4, which I stayed on, on my Dual 2Ghz G5 PowerMac 
until I replaced it with my current model 8-core Mac Pro.  I just 
tried it now on my Mac Pro, and the one mail box with over 10k 
messages that would choke it up

I believe you and others on this list have tried in the past to get 
me off of ClarisDraw.  At this point I'm more likely to simply use a 
pen &amp; paper and scan it.  OTOH, if you or anyone else has tips in 
making Adobe Illustrator behave like ClarisDraw, I'd love to hear 
them.

Realistically now that I'm on a current version of the OS, I should 
probably try out a couple CAD apps.  I tend to suspect they'll work 
better for me than any drawing apps.

Thanks, but I'm determined to learn Dreamweaver CS5, and so far doing 
okay at that.  I'm inclined to say I'm doing better than I did with 
CS3, and far better than I ever did with GoLive.

I have Creative Suite Premium, so it makes since to try and use 
Illustrator and Dreamweaver for things if at all possible.
