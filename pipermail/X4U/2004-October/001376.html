<PRE>This has been driving me nuts for a while, hoping someone can help me 
with it.

I have a snow non-Extreme base station at home, NATting my cable modem 
connection to three computers.  The PowerBook G3 has a fixed local IP 
and is connected by an Ethernet cable.  The Titanium G4 has a fixed 
local IP and is connected via Airport.  My AlBook 17&quot; is on DHCP and 
connects via Airport (and always gets assigned .1.4, the next available 
IP).

If it matters, in addition to the 10.0.1.x network from the base 
station, I have an irregular 192.168 network connecting the Titanium 
and the AlBook over a direct wire connection when I need more speed 
than 11 Mbps.

The symptom: my cable modem is silly fast; I've seen peak speeds of 700 
MBytes per second, and it's consistently doing 100-200 MBytes per 
second.  But over time, the speed degrades where it only peaks around 
150 and can poke along at 25-30.  Rebooting the Airport brings it back 
up to snuff; it's rare that I have to touch the cable modem.

When I run an application that causes heavy network traffic, I can blow 
out my network entirely and stop all Internet connections until I 
reboot the Airport.  BitTorrent does this intermittently; what I 
discovered today was that if I tried to run a port scan on a client's 
network (256 IPs, all ports), it'll kill the entire connection dead 
(including the port scan).  Stopping the scan does not resume traffic; 
I need to reboot the Airport for that.

I'm 100% certain this isn't an interference issue; one of the computers 
are connected by wire, and the other two are typically 5 feet away from 
the base station.

What's going on?  Is the hardware dying somehow?  My local Apple store 
suggested that it might be a heat issue, but the base station always 
runs cool.  So I'm just stumped.  Ideas?

Best,
Jeff Porten
