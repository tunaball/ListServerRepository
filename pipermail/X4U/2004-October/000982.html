<PRE>Hi all,

We've been receiving more and more layered Photoshop files that were 
constructed in RGB and contain adjustment layers (usually at the top) and 
layer effects that when the designers convert the file from RGB to CMYK, 
desiring to still keep the file in its layers for job adjustments, they 
get discarded or react completely different in the new colour space. This 
causes the image to become a complete disaster when comparing the old with 
the new. The image usually goes completely washed out and lacklustred.

Doing a &quot;Copy Merged&quot; and pasting into a new CMYK file keeps the image 
fidelity pretty accurate but they then lose the layers - again 
undesirable.

I've tried looking at recreating the adjustment layers by saving the RGB 
curves and loading them when in CMYK or entering the same Hue/Sat values 
in new adjustment layers but they just don't translate the same way under 
the different colour space.

I worked most of yesterday on an RGB image that had many adjustments made 
to it but one of them was a noise layer on top that used the &quot;overlay&quot; 
layer effect. It added a soft noise throughout the entire image but when 
the file was converted to CMYK this layer made the image look considerably 
greyed out. In the end I had to merge many layers together then use &quot;Apply 
Image&quot; to the various layers. I also discovered that using &quot;Apply Image&quot; 
at 100% created a much heavier noise on the affected layers and played 
around until I found the right value to produce the same amount of noise - 
between 70 and 75%. Note: the original RGB noise layer was set to 100% not 
70%.

I'm hoping that someone out there found a more simple way to translate 
such files from RGB to CMYK.

Your thoughts are most appreciated.

Cheers,

Cojcolds
