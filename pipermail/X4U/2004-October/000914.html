Nice try, but no.

Anyone who has access to a FTP server can do a simple test. Take a
15MB or so file. Upload it via FTP and see how long it takes. On my
cable connection something like that takes about 5 minutes, give or
take. Definitely slower than downloading, but it gets there.

Now take that 15MB file and upload it to iDisk and see how long it
takes. Oh wait, not a fair test because a 15MB file uploaded to iDisk
*may never get there*. You'll watch the progress bar for a while, and
then it just sits there until you give up. So instead, take 3 5MB
files (and a prayer) and upload those to iDisk. Now tell me that the
speed of iDisk is related to one's own Internet connection? From my
tests on the same computer connected to the same modem, it's not even
close.

No matter how you slice it, iDisk is slow. Painful at times. It's a
DVD-RAM drive in a land of DVD+/-R.

Those folks who signed up in the first week of .Mac and then renewed
for a 2nd year are facing the last week of their subscriptions, and
I'm letting my clock run down. I think the timing of these added
features are not an accident, but it's not enough for me. Every
feature is something that looks great on paper, but is executed poorly
to the point that I've replaced the functionality with something from
somewhere else. And this is from someone who was a cheerleader of .Mac
when it took over the former free iTools two years ago while many
people were yelling and signing petitions so I think I gave it more
than its fair chance to be something of value.
