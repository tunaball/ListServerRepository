<PRE>It is true that if you have a network and another computer is running Word
(same license) that it will detect it and you cannot run it. That is
different than what you are getting.
I would suggest running Disk Utility in your Utility folder and fixing
permissions. You can also use the program ONYX that can repair permissions
and does a bunch of other things, including verifying the directory (but
does not fix it), cleans the cache. 
It is also possible that you need to uninstall Office and reinstall the app,
including the patches. I would go with fixing permissions first, restart,
then try again. You should be able to do a change all and if not it is not
recognizing word. Did you move Word out of its default place in the
Application folder-if so then updates may not run correctly?

Subject: [X4U] Can't set MS Word as the default 

&gt;<i> I don't know how this happened but my Mac suddenly has trouble  
</I>&gt;<i> recognizing Word documents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even the screen icon is now missing on Word documents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I control-click on a Word document, the default program to open  
</I>&gt;<i> a Word file is Text Edit. If I select Other and choose MS Word in  
</I>&gt;<i> my Applications folder it does open it word. But only that one  
</I>&gt;<i> time. The next time I try to open it, Text Edit is again the  
</I>&gt;<i> default application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I do a Get Info on a Word file, Text Edit is listed as the  
</I>&gt;<i> application in which the file will open. If I select Other and  
</I>&gt;<i> choose Word, then MS Word appears in the drop down menu as the app  
</I>&gt;<i> to open  the file. But if I then click on the &quot;Change All&quot; button,  
</I>&gt;<i> the drop down menu changes to Word Pad, an application that needs  
</I>&gt;<i> to go through Fusion to open.  It is not possible to do a Change  
</I>&gt;<i> All to MS Word.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts on this very weird avoidance of Word as the app for  
</I>&gt;<i> opening Word documents?
</I>&gt;<i>

I have had some second thoughts on this issue--my Mac not  
recognizing .doc files as Word documents.

I used to regularly get a message when I tried to open a Word  
document on one computer when another computer on the network was  
running Word. It was something  to the effect that I couldn't run  
word on two computers at once.

But I don't get that message any more. I don't mean to be paranoid,  
but is  it possible the MS has altered the cache (or whatever in the  
System files) so that Word is no longer recognized on this one computer?
