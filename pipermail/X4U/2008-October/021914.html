Randy:

In the beginning (when I started up with COMCAST) I was neutral. Over  
the last two years I have become annoyed with them on so many issues  
I won't waste the groups time listing them. I  have had several email  
issues which finally got me to the point of past being annoyed but  
not to the point of quitting. Their &quot;support&quot; is almost non  
existence. Just one example was a bouncing email issue and after much  
talk they decided it was my &quot;server&quot; problem... HUH???!!! oh yes they  
were to dispatch an expert and of course it would cost me $$. Their  
almost non existent support for the MAC is almost infamous. I will  
not leave a technical person alone in the room with my computer as I  
have heard first hand horror reports from at least two people (both  
having MACS). The last and greatest reply from them after an email  
outage was well they schedule outages at their will and damn the  
customer. I wrote a email to a VP complaining that they should at  
least post on a web site when planned outages are going to happen.  I  
got back an answer that was well typical &quot;BIG MOTHER&quot; &quot;You will live  
with what we give you and stop complaining&quot;.

I will stop now venting on COMCAST. If I had san alternative I would  
use them.
