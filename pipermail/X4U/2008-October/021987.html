Ken, you are probably thinking of &lt;<A HREF="http://macvspc.info/">http://macvspc.info/</A>&gt;. However,  
Shawn is right in that all are true even if most could be relatively  
insignificant based on your skills. The precedent of making an  
exception seems like and usually is the real driving force. It seems  
to me that you are already on the way to justifying an exception with  
a business case. It just needs a lot of work--dirty looks won't cut it  
but company credibility to professionals to whom your company is  
selling products might. It will depend on how well you can stack up  
the facts. You may still need to go over the person's head with the  
help of your company's the marketing department, for example, if you  
have a strong enough case. Good luck! If you lose, you can always use  
your own Mac like I do. Bill
