<PRE>I've sat by during this whole POP-IMAP debate and wondered what the  
heck you people are going on about.

It is not an either/or decision. You don't have to choose either type  
and apply it to all your mail accounts.

I have 16 mail accounts over 4 servers.

MobileMe and the three master accounts at each server are IMAP. They  
can then all be synced to my iPhone and whatever happens on the iPhone  
is reflected on the server. Delete an email on the iPhone and it is  
deleted off the server.

The other 12 accounts are all POP. Why? Because I don't need them to  
be synced to the iPhone. They are only wanted to be on one machine,  
and as they are basically all mailing lists, I don't need to keep  
copies on the server.

Is there any difference between the accounts in usage?

Only the delay on the IMAP accounts while the server is read.

Otherwise they are all identical. Mail rules, archive storage and  
attachments.

Choose the type that suits you and is required by your usage of your  
account.

If POP is the best way to achieve what you want to achieve on that  
account, then use POP.

If IMAP is a better answer for that account and the usage you want,  
then choose IMAP for that account.

Simple really.

Regards,

cjc
