I'm puzzled actually. If you're selling in a device to graphics  
departments - which are notoriously pro-Apple - what the hell is it  
such that the entire company can avoid having at least one Apple Mac  
to test it against? I started to write:

&quot;Presumably your device requires a PC to run? For example is a printer  
connected to a PC RIP or some such? i.e. Does NOT connect directly to  
a Mac? If this is the case, I'll echo other's sentiments and say  
you're stuffed.&quot;

But then I realised you'd need some way of testing the printer driver  
with the PC RIP - so you'd need a Mac at some point to test.

I'd love to know what your company is selling in to other  
organizations' graphics departments which may be running Apple Macs  
but is such that your company doesn't need to test / have some  
knowledge of your devices ability to work in an Apple Mac environment.  
Seriously, what is it?

I'd support your IT guys sentiments except for the market you suggest  
you're targeting. I don't see how a company serious about the graphics  
industry can NOT have a couple of Macs knocking about.

Am I missing something here?
