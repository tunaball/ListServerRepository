Zane,

I had a 500GB Seagate drive in a FW enclosure develop some bad blocks 
and DiskWarrior could not rebuild the directory due to disk damage, but 
it did mount it's representation of the damaged drive, and from that, I 
was able to drag and drop hundreds of files, several at at a time, to 
copy them to another disk.

It was slow. It was laborious. But it worked, and I didn't have to 
rename any of the files like I would have to have done using a file 
scavenging routine such as TTP or Data Backup.

It was not a feature of DW that I even knew existed before, but in that 
instance, it was the most important feature in DW I have ever used.

Of course, ymmv depending on the degree of disk damage. Good luck.

Wayne Clodfelter
