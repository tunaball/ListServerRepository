The product is somewhat detached from pure graphics and so I'd say  
that your company can stand by its Windows only policy - unless you  
can prove a compelling reason otherwise.

Personally, I'd be concerned working with a company wedded to one  
version of Windows with close to zero exposure to other OSes given  
that the product needs to work within a heterogeneous environment -  
but then that's probably just me.

As others have said, see if you can make a viable business case -  
you're not going to win the argument on a purely technical basis.
