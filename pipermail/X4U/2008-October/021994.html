<PRE>I can't vouch for your business need and I highly agree and recommend  
you write your own business needs list and get your manager on board.

What I want to add to the mix is that there are a number of us here at  
FujiXerox Aust. who are running dual boot setups on Mac laptops -  
without any problems on the PC network.

Our PC guy has embraced the Mac community and while he's not able to  
support us Mac users anywhere near as well as the PC users he's  
willing to help us in any way he can. We Mac users often support  
ourselves anyway.

Try pitching to your IT guy that this can only be good for his IT  
skillset. There are a growing number of companies out there who are  
advertising IT related jobs and many of them are either requiring Mac  
support experience or   that having them is an advantage. Appeal to  
his narcissism.

Anyway, I wish you luck!

Cheers,

Cojcolds
