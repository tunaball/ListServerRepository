Linda:

I agree and the power supply was *WAY* outside of my comfort limit.  
When I saw how easy it was to pop it out I figured I didn't have  
anything to loose.
My thinking was a little bit clouded as I did not remember that the  
power supply might have some stored electrical energy left in it (I  
should have remembered basic science) but it was the furtherest thing  
from my mind. I guess I was naive enough to think if there was a  
danger the instructions would have mentioned.
You are 100 percent correct, that one should not  go blindly into  
such an endeavor like I did.
I was extremely prod of myself for doing this what turned out to be a  
simple task on an IBM pc. But as I said earlier the MAC looks a lot  
different inside than the PC did.
