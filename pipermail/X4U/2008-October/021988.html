John:


That might be OK in a small company but in a large company they have  
guidelines (rigid standards) about what can and cannot be hooked up  
to the net work (actually in their eyes its a good rule) and if  
*ANYTHING* goes wrong you are blamed and you will be fired without  
recourse. I have seen it myself so it does happen.
