<PRE> &gt;&gt; I have copied the response from my company's IT Manager.  He has
 &gt;&gt; refused my request for my laptop replacement to be a Mac.  You'll  
see
 &gt;&gt; that many of his reasons are baseless but I'm not sure how to
 &gt;&gt; respond.  Any help would be appreciated.  I do need to use Outlook  
and
 &gt;&gt; some other Windoze specific applications but that should be fine  
with
 &gt;&gt; BootCamp or Parallels.  I remember there were some web sites that  
have
 &gt;&gt; info to help refute reasons like the ones I was given but I can't  
seem
 &gt;&gt; to locate any recent ones.
 &gt;
 &gt; Actually I'd say he provided you with very good reasons to refuse  
your
 &gt; request.  My question is why you think you need a Mac laptop for  
work?  What
 &gt; is your justification?  What is the business need?

Great!  Now with parts 1, 2 and 3, it looks like I have given a bunch  
of reasons for people to keep Macs out of the workplace.  :-(

I wasn't coming at it from a business need.  I was coming at it from  
the issue of the Mac being the best tool for my job.  I don't want to  
give away who I work for or what I do but my job involves a lot of  
travel to customer sites with Mac-based graphics departments.  Many  
times I need to troubleshoot why certain graphics don't work with our  
device (non-Mac hardware/software) and I can't be on-site all the time  
so I need to use these graphics in both Mac and PC environments to get  
to the root of the problem.  Plus we are trying to court these same  
graphics people and going in there with a PC laptop will many times  
generate dirty looks.

I thought there were articles about how well the Mac works in the PC  
networking architecture and how adding Macs into a Windows environment  
did not add to IT support costs.  That is the type of information I  
was looking for to help back up my response.

Thanks,
