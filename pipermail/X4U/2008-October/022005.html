</I>
What can I say, I sit on the other side of the fence, though all the 
stuff I support sits in a computer room.  There is a lot to be said 
for standardized hardware and software builds.

&gt;<i>I wasn't coming at it from a business need.  I was coming at it from 
</I>&gt;<i>the issue of the Mac being the best tool for my job.  I don't want 
</I>&gt;<i>to give away who I work for or what I do but my job involves a lot 
</I>&gt;<i>of travel to customer sites with Mac-based graphics departments. 
</I>&gt;<i>Many times I need to troubleshoot why certain graphics don't work 
</I>&gt;<i>with our device (non-Mac hardware/software) and I can't be on-site 
</I>&gt;<i>all the time so I need to use these graphics in both Mac and PC 
</I>&gt;<i>environments to get to the root of the problem.  Plus we are trying 
</I>&gt;<i>to court these same graphics people and going in there with a PC 
</I>&gt;<i>laptop will many times generate dirty looks.
</I>
You're in sales I believe from something you've said, is this 
correct?  While you start by saying you weren't approaching this from 
a business need, what is the best tool for your job *IS* a business 
need.  As someone that deals with Vendors, what you say above tells 
me that you're looking for the hardware and software necessary to 
&quot;replicate and troubleshoot issues that your customers have&quot;. 
Additionally you're trying to &quot;avoid alienating your customers&quot; by 
showing up in a Mac Design house with a Windows laptop.

&gt;<i>I thought there were articles about how well the Mac works in the PC 
</I>&gt;<i>networking architecture and how adding Macs into a Windows 
</I>&gt;<i>environment did not add to IT support costs.  That is the type of 
</I>&gt;<i>information I was looking for to help back up my response.
</I>
These sorts of things are more nebulous.  In the corporate 
environment you've described I don't see this helping.

I think someone mentioned using your own laptop as a last resort.  I 
knew a woman that did customer support, in fact I converted her to 
the Mac.  While the company was *strictly* anti-Mac, she always 
brought in her PowerBook and used it.  I've heard of others doing 
this as well.
