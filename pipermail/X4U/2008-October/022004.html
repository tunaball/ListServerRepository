I would suggest that the person is toeing the company line. Now  
whether he helped create it or just obeying &quot;she who must be obeyed&quot;  
are two different items that will have to be attacked separately.

This is a tough nut to crack and its not clear its winnable (in your  
environment). You are the one that is going to have to take the time  
and spend the hours doing the research. Do NOT expect the IT people  
to do this as they will stack the odds against you. If you do not  
have the time to do this then maybe its time to decide whether  its  
worth the battle or not. I do not want to sound like a defeatist but  
you will probably loose. If your company is small then you have a  
decent chance of winning if its large then basically forget it and  
move on to either a better job or be prepared (as someone else put  
it) &quot;assimilated&quot;.

ps: BTW I was in a (large) DELL environment 10+ years ago. When I  
asked for more memory I just couldn't ask for 4 MEG for Model X. I  
had to in addition give a serial number and a date that the computer  
was built so Dell could figure out what memory I needed. I do *NOT*  
know if this has changed but if DELL is still sending out PC's  and  
made different  by the day. That is a MAJOR reason, IMO to drop *ANY*  
manufacturer. Memory is cheap and there is no need to vary it by date.
