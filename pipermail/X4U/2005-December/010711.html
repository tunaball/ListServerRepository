<PRE>I hope you're not _always_ this gullible, Jim!

She'd have been happy with one of the fine Brothers, I'm betting...
The guy who sold you that Husky more than earned his annual bonus on 
THAT sale!

Ooops! Sorry! Maybe you weren't looking for the truth, but a way... Oh, 
never mind.

</I>&gt;<i> bicycling. I remarried this year, and two days ago I went shopping for my
</I>&gt;<i> wife's Christmas present. I started at my local bike shop (when we met, my
</I>&gt;<i> wife had a bike I disparaged as much as we might the lowest of the Dells),
</I>&gt;<i> and I'd convinced her to sell it soon after we were married.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Christine had mentioned a few months ago she used to have a sewing machine,
</I>&gt;<i> and that she'd like to get back into that. SO, I also went to a sewing
</I>&gt;<i> machine shop, Consumer Reports in hand, ready to snap up the $500 &quot;Best Buy&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Brother or Singer model.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Oh my GOD, NO&quot; shrieked the VERY knowledgeable sales person, leading me to
</I>&gt;<i> the Husqvarna area, where I swallowed hard at the prices but became used to
</I>&gt;<i> the idea of spending $800.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then, I spent a sleepless night, with visions of Christine spending as much
</I>&gt;<i> time on that machine -- well, as much time as ***I*** spend fingers glued to
</I>&gt;<i> my Mac or butt in the saddle on my Calfee!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yesterday I enlisted my wife's vote, since this was turning out to be a
</I>&gt;<i> pretty expensive present, and I didn't want to screw it up. Before I knew it
</I>&gt;<i> we were looking at a $5,000 plus &quot;Designer 1&quot; machine that I must admit was
</I>&gt;<i> INCREDIBLY impressive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, why is this REMOTELY related to the Mac? Two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. I surprised myself with my concerns that Christine might throw herself
</I>&gt;<i> into this hobby; since it's Christmastime it's probably OK to cast this in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of the parable Jesus told about criticizing one's neighbor because of
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;mote&quot; (I think that's something tiny) in his eye, while neglecting the
</I>&gt;<i> beam in one's own eye. (I guess we can put computers and sewing machines in
</I>&gt;<i> the same room).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. We didn't get far enough into the demo of the sewing machine to discuss
</I>&gt;<i> what can be done with an attached personal computer, but the software
</I>&gt;<i> apparently is Windows-only, the Husqvarna company ships the software on 3.5
</I>&gt;<i> inch floppies, AND uses a hardware dongle for license verification. Does
</I>&gt;<i> anyone know whether this is beyond the ken of Virtual PC and a USB floppy
</I>&gt;<i> drive?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and can someone loan me $5,000 :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Wish me luck!)
