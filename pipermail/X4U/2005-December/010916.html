You've suggested a Mac, you've probably told her how great they are &amp; 
how you really like yours... I reckon you should maybe leave it at 
that?

If you push someone into switching you'll get the blame everytime 
something goes wrong, or they buy some specialist tool for their 
business &amp; it turns out that advanced features are only available if 
they install some software under Windows, or when AddressBook won't 
sync with their PDA or mobile phone or whatever.

If I just give them a gentle nudge to switch and they ignore me then 
I'll try to help the next time their Windows PC goes wrong... but I'll 
jocularly remind them &quot;you wouldn't have this problem if you'd bought a 
Mac&quot;. I work on the basis that they might just remember this a couple 
of years down the line, and that it's a little acorn of an investment 
which will hopefully grow into a Mac-switcher in the future. If someone 
has considered a Mac for longer then they're more likely to be 
understanding &amp; patient when they do have problems with it; if the idea 
is new to them and you push it then as soon as they find their printer 
or scanner is incompatible with OS X then it'll be a validation of the 
doubt they held over switching.

Stroller.
