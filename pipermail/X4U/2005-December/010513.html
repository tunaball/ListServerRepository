<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm curious what you can't find in Tiger that you can find in Panther.
</I>
Easily search by filename, which is 95% of what I do in the Finder.

In Panther Cmd-Alt-F put me in the search window and off I went. Now I have
to mouse-click around.

Then there are folders that Spotlight does not touch, so I cannot find
anything in there.

Then I have noticed (and others saw the same thing) that Spotlight would not
find items that are clearly there. Like having a file &quot;This is my
letter.rtf&quot; on the Desktop and searching for &quot;filename contains 'letter'&quot; in
your home directory and it won't show.

&gt;<i> I'd say what you request is not possible, as the Finder isn't merely a
</I>program, 
&gt;<i> but is an entire system of processes integral to the OS
</I>
I don't think that is correct. After all PathFinder is a single app that
replaces the Finder. The Finder is a plain application that however isn't
stored in the /Applications folder.

You can also quit the Finder after some tweaking, and live without it.

I am more concerned that Panther's Finder might apply destructive system
calls on Tiger. Some apps broke between Panther and Tiger and required an
update to function again. I was wondering if Panther's Finder is one of them
or if I could just copy it over from a Panther disk, put it in the
Application Folder and launch it from there.
