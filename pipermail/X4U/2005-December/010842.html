I recommend recloning anytime you've added an update, ran the system awhile,
and are assured that the update hasn't fouled anything up. That should preclude
introducing errors, of which corrupted preference files or cache files are the
main culprits. Most backup programs don't copy the cache files, so the most
likely errors are corrupt preference files. Checking them with something like
Preferential Treatment, repairing the disk and permissions, and then cloning so
minimize those.

Everyone has their own routine-some do it a couple of times a day, some once a
day, some never. You need to come up with a plan and then investigate the
various software packages to determine what's best for you. The average home
user can probably get away with recloning after an update. Data files don't
need cloning, you can just drag &amp; drop them.
