As Messrs Self &amp; Hargreaves have pointed out, it's all speculation at 
the moment.

I, too, have heard the rumour that iBooks will be first, but I've also 
heard a counter-argument that Intel's processors will be able to kick 
the pants off a G4; would Apple release an iBook that was more powerful 
than it's current Powerbooks?

The initial suggestion was that the Intel processors would be used on 
the low-end models first, but I wonder if this wasn't somewhat 
pandering to the entrenched &quot;megahertz myth&quot; belief that Apple have 
been fostering for so long. I guess a lot of us thought that Celerons 
would be fine for the low-end users and that Powerbooks &amp; Powermacs 
would only be sporting Intels at the end of next year, perhaps some 
surprise dual-Xeons with hyperthreading which would give unexpected 
performance leaps. Now that we've had a chance to get used to the idea, 
there's little doubt that Intels will be a good move right across the 
range - I believe ArcsTechnical did some performance tests with OS X 
running on an Intel which were quite impressive.

Anyway... it's all speculation, but isn't there usually some MacWorld 
or similar event in January at which new models are often unveiled?
