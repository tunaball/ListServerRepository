Ok, I thought that sounded too easy but please consider me a convert.

I wanted to take advantage of the time spent away at my mothers to  
backup my PowerMac - I figured that the slow part was going to to be  
copying across the network to my slow old file-server.

I ssh'd home and used `hdiutil`to create a 2gig auto-expanding sparse- 
image then dittoed the files across before running out of space on  
the sparseimage. If I were at home I might have spent more time  
trying to work out what was going wrong, but I hate doing serious  
homework on the cramped 12&quot; screen of my laptop.

So I tried using `hdiutil create -srcfolder /Users/stroller` but this  
repeatedly failed for lack of disk space. My home dir was about 24gig  
in all (so many iTunes!) and I was able to free up about another  
38gig on the 80gig hard-drive. My only guess is that when called in  
this form `hdiutil` makes a complete copy of the files before then  
making a full-size disk-image, but the only way to determine this  
would be to free up more space &amp; try again. That wasn't really a  
possibility.

After several attempts at this I decided to just create an over-sized  
disk image - 30gigs or so - and ditto the lot on to it, but by the  
time this finished and was copied across the LAN I was due home and  
had little time to check the backup had been successful.

Arriving home, then, I finally decided to do as you suggested. I  
cleared out a spare firewire drive, formatted HFS+ &amp; ran CCC. It took  
two attempts - the first time it wasn't bootable for some reason -  
and the little drive was stuffed full, but when it was finished I  
could boot up, enter the imaged system &amp; be fairly confident I'd got  
everything.

The bootable image proved IMMENSELY useful, as I did a format &amp;  
install on my old disk - there was just too much junk on there for an  
upgrade, but it turned out that iCal uses a different format for  
storing its data and copying the Preferences files and Application  
Support folders across from the firewire drive to the new one was  
unsuccessful. The Tiger installer itself must do some magic when  
upgrading, because my schedule came out blank!

I have a year &amp; a half worth of customer data cluttered in my iCal  
schedule, and I really didn't want to lose it. Thanks to your advice  
I was able to boot into the old install &amp; select &quot;Export&quot; in iCal.  
The import into the new version preserved all my data.

I'm extremely grateful to the list,

Stroller.
