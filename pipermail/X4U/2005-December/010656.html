<PRE>Thank you, Michael, for reading well; my question is indeed for a  
client. While the varying opinions are interesting - this method is  
the one I have been asked to provide a solution for. Please trust  
that this has been thoroughly considered and discussed.

Spector Soft provides &quot;spyware&quot; that will work on OS X, however, the  
automatic e-mail reporting features do not work. (I am now registered  
with them to test new Mac versions as they are available, mainly  
because I wish to follow the development of such nasty stuff in the  
happy Mac world.)

The software is fully invisible and the data file is kept at &quot;usr/ 
local/.spsnaps&quot;. Unfortunately, I am not proficient at Unix to be  
able to access, use, e-mail, etc. this data file. Situation is having  
to actually be at the computer in question to input the keyboard  
sequence to bring up the log-in window and subsequent slide-show  
style play-back. The app prefs are set for 30 second screen shots  
with a 3 minute time-out, file size at 2GB. Once the file size limit  
is reached, it will continue to record over the earlier entries.

My client has no intention of reviewing these files on a regular  
basis. However, I wish to be able to provide a method of &quot;filing&quot;  
them for an unspecified retention period.

Netopia has wi-fi hardware that appears to do something interesting  
with no computer installed software. I will speak to their tech folks  
Monday.

This is the information/assistance I hope to find from this list of  
very knowledgeable folks.

Thanks much,
Brenda
