Hi there,

I have a Pixima 3000, which is one of the models without a built-in 
scammer.

Some of the options are available from the Print dialogue 
&lt;<A HREF="http://mac.stroller.uk.eu.org/PiximaPreferences.gif">http://mac.stroller.uk.eu.org/PiximaPreferences.gif</A>&gt; but others are 
available only by going into Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Printer Setup 
then double-clicking on the Pixima in the list of printers. At the top 
of the window that opens is a button for Utility - double click this &amp; 
then select the printer again in the next window 
&lt;<A HREF="http://mac.stroller.uk.eu.org/PiximaMaintenance1.gif">http://mac.stroller.uk.eu.org/PiximaMaintenance1.gif</A>&gt;. Click on 
Maintenance for further options 
&lt;<A HREF="http://mac.stroller.uk.eu.org/PiximaMaintenance2.gif">http://mac.stroller.uk.eu.org/PiximaMaintenance2.gif</A>&gt;; these seem to 
be the options that you wouldn't normally change during use - for 
instance mine is permanently in &quot;quiet&quot; mode as it doesn't seem much 
slower, but it's much quieter &amp; the desk wobbles wildly from side to 
side in loud mode!

&gt;<i> Worse, it refuses to print when connected to the AE box. Note that the 
</I>&gt;<i> driver software was downloaded about a week ago to ensure it was the 
</I>&gt;<i> latest. OTOH, does print if connected to the G5, but need it to work 
</I>&gt;<i> off the AE network.
</I>
How's the Pixima connected to the Airport Distress? If you're using the 
USB cable then I fear you may be disappointed; I tired mine using a 
similar setup, a Netgear USB print server and had no joy at all.

I think that if you want to print wirelessly you should've probably 
bought a printer that has a proper network connection built-in.

I think Canon make a printer-only Pixima - the 5000?? - that has an 
Airport Extreme-style wireless interface built in, but I can't find any 
of their mutli-functionals that are networkable. This is a bit 
disappointing, as I've been extremely happy with my Pixima and have 
also recently been given (via the excellent Freecycle network) a 
separate Canon scanner which works well; I had thought to replace them 
with a multifunctional, but in the UK the models that do direct-on-CD 
printing are a not-so-cheap &#163;200.

Another range to look at is Brother's. The online electricals store of 
the UK grocer Tesco last week had the Brother DCP-310CN on close-out - 
the new model is the 315, I think - and my mother asked me to take a 
look at the specs &amp; Macintosh-compatibility for her. It has a standard 
Ethernet connector so can join your network with a cable to your 
wireless router (or Airport Distress?) and comments from Mac users (on 
Amazon, I think) were positive; Brother's webpage provides drivers for 
10.3 but more for 10.4 - it look like the scanner functions may be 
better supported. The 310 was a bargain &#163;80 including free delivery so 
I told my Ma they were out of stock &amp; bought her one for Christmas. 
Considering the network connectivity &amp; that the Brother has 4 separate 
inktanks I consider that EXCELLENT value; I guess they may do wireless 
models or you could connect to your wireless LAN using a bridge.

&gt;<i> And then when connected to the G5, I periodically lose the wireless 
</I>&gt;<i> internet connection. Rather, the latest is that the MP is connected 
</I>&gt;<i> directly to the G5 and the G5 periodically loses the signal from the 
</I>&gt;<i> AE box -- falls off the network. Please advise.
</I>
The G5 periodically looses wireless connectivity? I don't see that 
connection of the printer via USB can make any difference there. Usual 
advice applies - move the base-station nearer or try a different one. I 
think the G5 will have an internal aerial, so you're stuffed on 
changing that.

Stroller.
