I had a similar issue with an attempt to order my first book through  
iPhoto. After completing the entire process (including uploading the  
files) I received a 'communications error' and the order was never  
officially put through. I tried again with no luck. Later when I was  
checking my bank account online I saw two pending debits for the book  
I was never able to order. I attempted to call Apple but was told by  
the person I reached that they didn't handle any iPhoto issues and  
referred me to the iPhoto support pages. I submitted a request from  
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/iphoto/customerservice/shipping/">http://www.apple.com/support/iphoto/customerservice/shipping/</A>&gt; and  
received the following response from the iPhoto Team:

'iPhoto service places an pre-authorization on your card to verify  
your information before we process your order. While automated pre- 
approvals can be seen on your online statement, pre-authorizations  
will not appear on your credit card statement and are typically  
removed from your account within 24 to 48 hours, depending on your  
bank's policies. You may wish to contact your financial institution  
to confirm this information. Please place a new order at your  
convenience.'

I hope this helps.
