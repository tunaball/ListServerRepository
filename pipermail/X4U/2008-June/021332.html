Be paranoid. It is fine with me. I suppose if I were 'big brother' the  
first people I'd start watching is those who are paranoid! I'd bet  
Homeland Security is already monitoring these very list serves!

It used to be axes that were the preferred method of murdering. Guess  
we have moved past that now.

IF really want to stop mayhem probably removing cars from our society  
would be the very first thing to get rid of. Who would have thought  
how horrible of a device cars would turn out to be. So I guess I agree  
with you those technological innovations are pretty bad for the  
society as a whole!

Since this is off topic and probably senseless I'll stop posting.
