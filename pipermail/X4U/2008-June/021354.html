<PRE>You really don't understand what innovation is, do you Ed?

Innovation isn't using something that someone else has created. Using  
TCP/IP isn't innovation. Using 50 cpu's isn't innovation.

Innovation is creating that different thing. Innovation is creating  
that different way of doing something. Innovation is creating a new  
CPU. Innovation is designing a new networking protocol Innovation is  
the bleeding edge!

And innovation is always hampered by &quot;backwards compatibility&quot;.

My statement still stands.
