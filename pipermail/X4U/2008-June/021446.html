Along with 98 other programs, all who have there very strong  
supporters. It sounds good, and I have checked it out, but so do all  
the rest and it's at least $89.95, although OWC does offer it in on  
some drives, however not any of the last 4 lap top drives I bought in  
the last month along with enclosures and long a box full of other items.

That the average user can not simply drag and drop and have a boot  
copy of his HD and include everything. This is not from lack of  
paying attention, or there would not be 99 programs or more to back  
things up. I could teach over the phone this very simple task in the  
Previous OS. Every program mentioned has it's problems and weak  
points, works good at back up but restore is problematic or  the  
other way around.   Apple's  admittance to the problem,  was to  
select an &quot;automatic&quot;  methodology just add more layers. You may have  
more layers but the underlying problem is there. Let us not get to  
overly pompous at the success and acceptance that Apple has enjoyed.   
We still need to not only make movie magic for the big screen, but  
let the average person work and not lose all there data and then be  
told what it will cost. Of the 5 people who I got to buy a Mac this  
year, either switching up from OS 9  #1 and  #4 being switchers, I  
could not convince the importance to buy a separate HD to only 1 .  
The say I just spent $3400.00 why do I need to spend $350.00 more .  
It's just something that has been poorly designed from the start and  
if you go and look at the Apple boards , even though Apple takes a  
fair share down, it's clear people have trouble.
