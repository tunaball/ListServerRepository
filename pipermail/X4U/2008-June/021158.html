Looks like the problem is that Daly has a cable modem and a router, 
and it's been suggester that she log in to the cable modem. Many 
(most?) modern routers incorporate the modem function in the router. 
Mine does. It's quite possible that the cable modem has no login from 
the LAN side. My ADSL modem / router shows the WAN traffic info 
because it's all in the same box.

The cable modem is a cable signal to ethernet converter, so the LAN 
side is ethernet, so it has an IP address. How difficult it is to 
find that address, and whether or not it has a built-in webserver 
listening on that address depends on the specific hardware. The 
router may keep the information required though, and it may be 
available through _its_ web interface.

What I've referred to as a router may in fact be a switch (or hub), 
but then there would be no DHCP and all networked devices would have 
to have their IP addresses manually configured. This is an unlikely 
solution for an ISP to offer.
