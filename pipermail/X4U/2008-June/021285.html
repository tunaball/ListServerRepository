<PRE>&gt;<i> I just can't understand why a group of COMPUTER users is so afraid of
</I>&gt;<i> change, progress or new technologies.
</I>&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i> Tim Collier
</I>
Not everyone can afford to replace their system ever 12-18 months like you
apparently can.  Additionally some of us have legacy requirements which make
new hardware or software troublesome.  For example for me moving to 10.4
meant moving my HP LaserJet 5MP to an HP JetDirect box, moving Mac data
(some had been there for nearly 10 years) off of a server, and upgrading the
OS on two different computers (the other isn't a Mac).  Moving to 10.5 will
be painful as well since I have been unable to get off of ClarisDraw, I
simply can't find anything that works as well for what I do.

Some of us have accumulated *DECADES* of computer data and software, this
can make upgrades &quot;interesting&quot;.  I have personal data on my Mac dating back
to the 80's, along with software and source code dating back to the 60's
(obviously run under emulation).

Apple is increasingly showing that it doesn't care about long term customers
and thier requirements.  A perfect example is classic Appletalk support.  It
was missing in 10.0 and 10.1, back in 10.2, and gone in 10.4, I wasn't the
only one on this list when 10.4 came out that was hurt by this.

Most people here seem to understand that if something works for you, it
would be nice if certain companies didn't force you to go out and replace
it.
