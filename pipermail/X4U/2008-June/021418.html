No, I don't work that way.  No supposition is involved.

This was a first-hand experience.  They quoted a ridiculous price for  
a run of the mill recovery of a failed hard drive, they stated that  
they don't recover applications, and that they only recover the file  
types that are agreed on.  I find this to be outrageous.  Other  
recovery services will simply give you a new hard drive with *all* of  
your data from the deceased drive on it.  And they will charge less too.

&gt;<i> Perhaps you have done them a disservice?
</I>
Nope.  Unless for some reason that I can't imagine they treated me  
differently than they do everyone else.

If you want to be raped by them, then by all means have them do your  
recovery work.  Please let us know how it felt afterwards.

As I said previously, at this point in time, there are plenty of  
other respected recovery services that do a great job, cost far less,  
and are quite a bit more accommodating to their customers.   I'd go  
with one of them.
