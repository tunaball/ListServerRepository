<PRE>Well, this is just from what I see in the city that I live in.  Many people
I know do not even have 'home phones' anymore.  I know families that insist
that children as young as 8 carry cell phones with them.  These are
dangerous times we live in.  Living in a large city makes the ability to
talk to anybody at any time very important and the 'cell phone' is now a
part of modern life.  I just happen to prefer that my cell phone be an
iPhone.  It makes my life a lot simpler.  And for all of you out there who
do not have cell phones, you are the exception not the average.  So, please
don't give me anymore of that &quot;I don't have a cell phone and never have had
one.&quot;  You're out of step with the rest of the civilized world--catch up.

read it on 6/15/08 7:27 PM, I became so enthusiastic, I was forced to take
an extra Xanax 1 mg.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My husband and I don't have cell phones. My parents in law don't own any,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just anecdotal, but true. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure it will change. Our entire family got on cell phones, on the
</I>&gt;<i> same Sprint account, when my father was moved to an assisted living
</I>&gt;<i> facility, with a terrible form of Parkinson's disease. The family is
</I>&gt;<i> very dispersed across the country. Our all being on the same network
</I>&gt;<i> meant that we were all in very constant contact, and it meant that we
</I>&gt;<i> were all able to gather there a week before he died, and again a few
</I>&gt;<i> hours before he died. And now we are all able to be in touch with my
</I>&gt;<i> mother soon to pass 86.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is our particular situation. But for us, it has been a huge
</I>&gt;<i> comfort to have each other a &quot;click away&quot; during this phase of life.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Besides dramatic stuff like that, it's very enjoyable for my husband
</I>&gt;<i> to call after work and say he's at  a certain store and is there
</I>&gt;<i> anything I need him to get.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or for me to call from my car to tell a client and say I will be ten
</I>&gt;<i> minutes late because of unexpected traffic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or to lose my friend or husband at a fair or big event and say, &quot;I'm
</I>&gt;<i> by the Apple booth - where are you?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And on and on and on. We don't even use the calendar and internet and
</I>&gt;<i> those types of features. Just having connectivity is very very nice.
</I>&gt;<i> The big thing is having the whole family on the same account. It
</I>&gt;<i> makes it very inexpensive and we can call each other any time, at no
</I>&gt;<i> charge, anywhere in this country, in Canada, and a few other places.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ours is anecdotal, and very usual, and also true. Unless, you are
</I>&gt;<i> counting pennies every month, I think it's worth considering, to have
</I>&gt;<i> a family account, even if a very basic one. All of us are aware of
</I>&gt;<i> the limited minutes we buy for our shared account and we are careful
</I>&gt;<i> to mainly only call each other or other people on Sprint during peak
</I>&gt;<i> hours. So we pay very little, but get very much security and
</I>&gt;<i> enjoyment.
