New Compaq Evo Notebook to Deliver a Full Business Day of Battery  
Life in a Sleek, Two-and-a-Half Pound Design



NEW YORK, June 27, 2001

Continuing a commitment to deliver edgy, innovative and  
technologically advanced products, services and solutions it promised  
with the launch of Evo products, Compaq Computer Corporation (NYSE:  
CPQ) today unveiled the Compaq Evo Notebook N200 during a PC Expo  
press event focused on mobility. Available later this year, the 2.5  
pound ultra-thin notebook provides a full business day of battery  
life (up to 8 hours(1)) in a slim, stylish form factor that measures . 
8 inch thin.

&quot;The Evo N200 provides users all the power they've come to expect in  
a full-size notebook, yet the N200 delivers this power in a mini- 
notebook that weighs less than 3 pounds, can literally fit into a  
standard eight-by-eleven envelope, and can last a full business day  
without having to recharge the battery,&quot; said Ken Willett, vice  
president of Corporate Portable and Desktop Marketing, Compaq Access  
Business Group. &quot;The Evo N200 sets the new standard in mini-notebooks  
by packing up to 8 hours of battery life into a small, lightweight  
form factor.&quot;

By combining the upcoming Intel&#174; Ultra Low Voltage Pentium&#174; III  
processor with two Lithium-Ion batteries(2), the Evo Notebook N200  
provides the industry's highest energy density. This results in a  
notebook that can last a full business work day without having to be  
recharged.

&quot;The mobile Intel Ultra Low Voltage Pentium III processor family  
delivers the worlds lowest power PC and was designed specifically for  
the smallest mobile PCs, like the Compaq Evo N200,&quot; said Frank  
Spindler, vice president of Mobile Products, Intel Corporation. &quot;When  
you combine the low power consumption of Intel's processor with the  
outstanding features on the Compaq Evo N200, the customer is getting  
the best combination of performance and mobility available in the  
mini-notebook market.&quot;

The Evo Notebook N200 allows users to stay connected anytime,  
anywhere by offering a choice of both wired or wireless network  
connectivity. The Evo Notebook N200 supports the full suite of Compaq  
wireless PC cards including Wi-Fi (802.11b), Ricochet and CDPD  
(Cellular Digital Packet Data) solutions, as well as support for  
future Bluetooth&#8482; PC card solutions. Unlike most of the Mini- 
notebooks currently available, the Evo N200 also offers an integrated  
Modem/NIC combo allowing users to hardwire to their existing land- 
based network without having to use the PC card slot.

The Evo Notebook N200 is a &quot;Legacy- Free&quot; Windows 2000 device, using  
two USB ports in place of serial or parallel legacy ports. Other  
features on the N200 include: a 10.4-inch XGA TFT display with  
magnesium enclosure, 128 MB of memory, 20 GB hard drive, and dual  
battery support. An optional Mobile Expansion Unit seamlessly  
connects to the Evo Notebook N200 and replicates all legacy expansion  
ports; provides a single MultiBay&#8212;which accommodates all Evo common  
MultiBay optical devices such as CD, DVD, CD-RW, and DVD/CD-RW drives&#8212; 
and provides two speakers.

Compaq expects to ship the Evo Notebook N200 later this year. Pricing  
is not yet available. For additional information on the Compaq Evo  
Notebook N200, please visit the Compaq Evo PressPaq at http://
