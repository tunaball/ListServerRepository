Randy,

Aren't you being a bit rough on DriveSavers without presenting facts  
to us? You have made a statement that lacks proof and is a supposition  
on your part. How do you know for a fact that they will do as you  
describe? Has it actually happened to you or a person you know  
personally?

I have a close friend who used their services to recover data for the  
Butte County Search and Rescue team and DriveSavers did an excellent  
job for them. The entire &quot;lost&quot; drive contents were recovered quickly  
and returned to the team on a replacement drive. Their cost was  
reasonable, also, for the work done.

I do admit that I do not know exactly how much effort DriveSavers had  
to put out to recover the data. It might have been as easy as just  
rebuilding the directory information. Of course, it might also have  
been a &quot;tear apart, rebuild, and recover&quot; job. They never did tell how  
much work it took, just did the job and gave back what was thought to  
be totally lost.

Perhaps you have done them a disservice?
</PRE>
