What a load of absolute crap this line is!

It is &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; that always limits innovation.

Just look at Windows. So many of the design decisions are and were  
made for &quot;backwards compatibility&quot;. So now we have major parts of XP  
and Vista that are unbelievably limited because of that very design  
flaw.

And that&#8217;s what backwards compatibility is, it's a design flaw.

Is 10.5 better than 10.4? Yes, I think it is. I find it much more  
reliable and much easier to use. So I checked my hardware and found,  
yes it will run 10.5.

If I check it and I find &quot;No, it doesn't&quot; then I have to make a  
decision about whether I need 10.5 and it's facilities. If I do, then  
I have to upgrade my hardware. If I don't, then I don't have to  
upgrade my hardware.

If you don't want the facilities of 10.5, then you have no problems.  
Stick with 10.4.11 and be happy.

If you want 10.5 and your hardware won't handle it, then decide how  
badly you need those features. If the need is great enough you will  
upgrade.

If you still don't want to upgrade, then stay with 10.4.11. And don't  
keep complaining that Apple should keep limiting innovation by staying  
&quot;backwards compatible&quot;

If they had stayed &quot;backwards compatible&quot; when they moved into the  
phone market, we would never have had the iPhone.

If you don't want to move from your &quot;beloved&quot; Claris Draw, then stick  
with your old hardware and operating system. Don't limit my usage of  
the new facilities of 10.5 by forcing Apple to keep Classic Mode just  
to support 1 program for 1 person.

Life moves forward. It doesn't stay still, and it doesn't go backwards.

Move with it!

My AUS$0.02 worth!
