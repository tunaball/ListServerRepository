That's great!

Sounds like your computer/camera gear is really doin' it for you.

There's another viewpoint, tho. People used to go on vacation to get  
away from their daily routine. They took photos with chemical film,  
and how those turned out would be a mystery until couple weeks after  
their return.

Mostly their vacation was about being there, not capturing the moment  
forever and zapping it up onto an electronic network for the world to  
see, hours after that moment was captured.

It sounds like you are really getting the ride you want from your  
rig, and as soon as the ride's no longer fun, you'll be shopping for  
the next newest, faster, more capable thing.

And maybe that thing will be that you'll be able to take and upload  
vacation photos for your family and friends to see BEFORE you even  
leave for vacation!

wouldn't THAT be a buzz?

then you could really leave the computers and gear behind and have  
this whole new cutting-edge experience...

but then, I'm wierd...

[btw: you took some NICE photos...thanks for including the link.]
