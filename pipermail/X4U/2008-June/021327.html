The basic theory is sound and seems harmless, carry a cell phone and  
your safer. However to get that safety, we give up certain rights. It  
may not seem important when your handling that bright new shiny  
iPhone, but our calls can be monitored without a warrant, by any  
Homeland Land Security Specialist. The tracking device inside the  
phone lets any one monitor your movements again with out a warrant or  
your knowledge. I think that is a pretty big trade off and since as  
it was pointed out that land lines are disappearing, so shall the  
right to speak in privacy to someone on a telephone.

We give up something for every bit of technology that we develop  
today, mostly because we forgot, that those people we let get in  
charge, are only supposed to do what we tell them to, not follow what  
they tell us to do. Some how that ideal, that invb=wnru

The device that saved your friends life, has cost many lives, it is  
the preferred weapon of the people of the countries we now occupy  
with over 175,000 troops and close to 6000 American dead and 60,000  
wounded. It seems they work well at setting off IADs. This may not  
effect you in Montana but today, I am sure it effected someone. To  
bad that what we do invent is so often used for some good things, but  
a lot of bad also. Not trying to make a political statement, just  
showing both sides of technology and how our present state of mind  
takes as much as it seems to give.
