</I>&gt;<i> Or for me to call from my car to tell a client and say I will be

</I>&gt;<i> Or to lose my friend or husband at a fair or big event and say,  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I'm by the Apple booth - where are you?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And on and on and on. We don't even use the calendar and internet  
</I>&gt;<i> and those types of features. Just having connectivity is very very  
</I>&gt;<i> nice. The big thing is having the whole family on the same account.  
</I>&gt;<i> It makes it very inexpensive and we can call each other any time,  
</I>&gt;<i> at no charge, anywhere in this country, in Canada, and a few other  
</I>&gt;<i> places.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ours is anecdotal, and very usual, and also true. Unless, you are

</I>&gt;<i> have a family account, even if a very basic one. All of us are  
</I>&gt;<i> aware of the limited minutes we buy for our shared account and we  
</I>&gt;<i> are careful to mainly only call each other or other people on  
</I>&gt;<i> Sprint during peak hours. So we pay very little, but get very much  
</I>&gt;<i> security and enjoyment.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>Daly:

You have some valid points. Indeed I was put in a nursing home that  
did not have telephones. I found it to be a PITA, honestly. The only  
&quot;good&quot; that came out of it was that I found out that cell phones  
(even with instruction books) are difficult to use. I don't know how  
many times I tried calling people  and ended up not getting them. Was  
it worth it so friends could call me up? No as I was never able to  
get to the phone fast enough to answer the damn thing and it went to  
voice mail. I still have that issue to this days 4 years later.  
Trying to access VM is (at least on my phone) is difficult to do so I  
don't try. For all I know I may have 100 VM's waiting for me.  Again  
my complaint is usability.  I have had two different phones and every  
time the people at the phone store say any idiot can do it. Sorry  
that is NOT true.

What good is it in an emergency if the cell phone is so complicated  
that by the time you are able to dial out the person has robbed you.  
For *SOME* people it may make sense but if you have any sort of  
disability its essentially useless.
