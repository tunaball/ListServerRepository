First go round would be a browser directed at the internal IP of your  
router (which you can dig out from network preferences). You can give  
that a go and see where you get to. After that, I'm not too sure what  
to suggest wrt the cable modem as it'd involve looking around and  
trying a few things depending on what turns up.

So if you can't get in through the browser, let's write that off as a  
process.

After that we're back full circle to see what info you can dig out of  
the Airport Extreme. I've got an Airport Express here which seems to  
offer some logging capabilities - but quite how extensive they are and  
how I take full advantage, I know not. I'm guessing I'd need to use  
SNMP to get log details and then analyse that. I don't have the time  
to look into that.

Maybe someone else can step in?
