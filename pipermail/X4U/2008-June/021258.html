Well for one a CEO does not *LUG* computers around they have people  
to handle life's little drudgeries.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And what about people who aren't CEOs who still just want one?
</I>
Fine if they don't spend corporate (not theirs) money on one. If they  
want one and can afford it why not? But I will bet you a dollar that  
every CEO in Fortune the 500 will not shell out their own money for  
one. They just get the company to buy it and again a waste of money.

</I>&gt;<i> the store
</I>&gt;<i> brand sneaker. Some people will buy an iPod Video rather than a less
</I>&gt;<i> expensive Nano... So why the hostility toward people who chose to  
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> their purchase to a more expensive MacBook Air?
</I>
I could care less if they buy it on their own dime just don't ask the  
shareholders to pay for such a &quot;I've got money and you don't&quot;  
attitude. After all its just eye candy. If it were to do any serious  
work it would need a DVD/CDROM in it. I know everyone of my friends  
and some high level types that demand a DVD/CDROM on their computer  
and they work for a living:)
Again you are taking this personally of course everyone has a right  
to make up their own mind (assuming its being paid for on their own  
dime) as to what computer they want. If its being paid for out of the  
corporate coffers then I would hope that they would be cost conscious  
and not go for the eye candy. I know there are some less than  
honorable types out there and they will go out and get the company to  
pick up the tab, I just want to know which so I don't buy any of  
their stock. This is similar to buying a corporate jet its for the  
status just like a MACBOOK AIR is.

Do you think a CEO is really worried about upgrades? Nope if he wants  
it he gets it and the stockholders are getting less dividends. Yea I  
know maybe a 1/10th of a penny (at most) for each share. But wasting  
money on this extravagance is just about corporate malfeasance. A  
corporate jet while not a necessity in 90 percent of the cases there  
is a slim 10 percent chance that it is justified. I would like to see  
a written justification (that the employees have to do for a software  
package). You think a CEO justifies this in reality no, but I sure  
do. So what is good for the ........
Face it a MACBOOK air might be a nice item but to have someone else  
pay for it is just plain absurd, IMO. Yes CEO's are way overpaid and  
they should be able to buy it on their own dime, fine.
