</I>&gt;<i> Ah, Ed, you have just illustrated the beauty of the iPhone.  Right

</I>&gt;<i> the box, it is a familiar thing.  If you've used an iPod, it's  
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the
</I>&gt;<i> same.  You activate it in iTunes by choosing your plan with AT&amp;T  
</I>&gt;<i> and you're
</I>&gt;<i> done.  At the same time, you can upload your music, pictures,  
</I>&gt;<i> contacts, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Even if the call goes to voice mail (sometimes I leave the phone at  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> other end of the house), it is very easy to retrieve the v-mail and  
</I>&gt;<i> even
</I>&gt;<i> return the missed call.  I've never had to use the manual (can't  
</I>&gt;<i> say the
</I>&gt;<i> same for previous phones).  Everything is very intuitive.  After  
</I>&gt;<i> all it's
</I>&gt;<i> running OS X!
</I>&gt;<i> I've also traveled all over Europe with it and get the same service  
</I>&gt;<i> and

</I>&gt;<i> They are
</I>&gt;<i> miles apart.
</I>&gt;<i> And I also wanted to add a message to those anti-cell phone people  
</I>&gt;<i> who have
</I>&gt;<i> chosen to contact me personally:  If you want to continue to live  
</I>&gt;<i> in the
</I>&gt;<i> past (this reminds me of people who chose to stick with their  
</I>&gt;<i> typewriter
</I>&gt;<i> instead of opting for a computer with a word processor or those who  
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> still opting to hold on to their analog TV's and avoid an HDTV  
</I>&gt;<i> (you're in
</I>&gt;<i> for an unpleasant surprise next February)) that's all well and good  
</I>&gt;<i> if it
</I>&gt;<i> works for you.  I do have to point out that you are isolating  
</I>&gt;<i> yourself from
</I>&gt;<i> a great number of people who cannot call you if you're not at  
</I>&gt;<i> home.  God
</I>&gt;<i> forbid there should be an emergency while on the highway (are you  
</I>&gt;<i> going to
</I>&gt;<i> drag yourself home to call for help?) or you see a fabulous sale  
</I>&gt;<i> and would
</I>&gt;<i> like to let your friends know about it (you go home, call them and  
</I>&gt;<i> by the
</I>&gt;<i> time they get there everything is gone) or lastly you are in a  
</I>&gt;<i> business
</I>&gt;<i> where decisions need to be made instantaneously but you're at the park
</I>&gt;<i> enjoying the sunshine, you miss the call at home--it was super- 
</I>&gt;<i> critical--you
</I>&gt;<i> show up at work the following day to see your business closing and  
</I>&gt;<i> everybody
</I>&gt;<i> looking at you with an evil stare.  These examples just go to  
</I>&gt;<i> illustrate
</I>&gt;<i> that the cell phone is an integral part of our lives in the early  
</I>&gt;<i> part of
</I>&gt;<i> the 21st Century.  If you are a hermit or work out of your house or  
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> agoraphobic, technophobic (well then you wouldn't be using a  
</I>&gt;<i> computer), I
</I>&gt;<i> guess I can understand; otherwise I and the rest of the civilized  
</I>&gt;<i> world
</I>&gt;<i> simply can't understand your reluctance.
</I>&gt;<i>

I hate to be the bearer of news but I had a small IPOD (sorry don't  
remember what model) but I don't have a clue on how to use it. I  
tried to figure it out and gave up. I ended up giving it away to a  
friend who helped me buy my G5 as a thank you gift. But IIRC  
(questionable here) it did not come with instructions (bought  
directly from Apple) I gave up trying to even turn it on. (no on/off  
switch) . At least he is happy with it.
