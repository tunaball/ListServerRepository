</I>Well, they probably could track where your cell phone is which is not  
necessarily where you are. Cell phones have 'saved' many lives. I have  
a close friend who is alive today due to the availability of a cell  
phone at an accident scene. So you bet you are safer carrying a cell  
phone around. I try to keep the cell phone with me all of the time  
now. Unfortunately I live in an area where I can not get ATT service  
(so therefore I can't get an iPhone. :(


&gt;<i> &quot;Corporation IT members at the recent InfoSecurity Europe exhibition  
</I>&gt;<i> regarded smartphones as a growing security risk, with concern higher

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Individuals have been stealing from Corporations for as long as they  
have existed. I suppose people have been stealing for as long as we  
have recorded history. Technology has not changed that aspect of our  
lives.

&gt;<i> So it's the same old problem, we get the technology, that granted,  
</I>&gt;<i> can be used for a better society, but rarely does this happen with

</I>
I am not sure what the negative impacts are but I certainly see lots  
of places where 'technological improvements' have had a hugely  
positive impact on my life.

To be on topic for a moment. I have a G4 933 that will be orphaned  
within the next year or two at best. I wish that my old Apple IIe was  
still supported  too. Progress is life! My G4 is still very useful, I  
do my email with it. And you know what it still is waiting for my  
feeble brain to catch up most of the time!
