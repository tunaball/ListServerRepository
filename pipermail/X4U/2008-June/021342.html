Well I have you one better, Alaska is my home, and I do not live here  
because I am paranoid, to the contrary, I have shared this with 100s  
of people. To a person, the most common phrase,	 this is the most  
magnificent country I have ever seen, it is so much more then I  
thought. Having flown all over the the US , Mexico , Canada, I can  
say nothing compares to the true wild and untamed land of Alaska.

I am not here because I am paranoid, can't live here and be that way.  
Probably for many of the same reasons you are in Montana. Good  
people, government out of our lives as much as can be, and to live  
somewhere that still has much of what it once was. I have stood on  
lakes and camped where no other man is within a hundred miles radius.  
You feel alive,

They already do monitor, every email message and every phone call,  
they are washed through NSA computers looking for key words, find  
enough of the right words and it's looked at , not sure how many  
washes it takes to get to a human to look at it, dig a little,  
nothing is private anyone more. Over 30,000 people were investigated  
last year with out their knowing it.

You do have a good Governor in Montana, he told the HSS folks to go  
stick it with the National ID card that everyone was supposed to have  
by this May, to get on planes. They replied, nobody from Montana will  
get on any aircraft. Problem, they do not have any of these cards  
made up yet.  But there coming. With a chip.
