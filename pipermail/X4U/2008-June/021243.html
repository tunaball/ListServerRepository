I have stayed out of the iphone crap mainly because I can barely  
handle my own stupid phone. The people who designed it really do not  
have a clue for everyday use. I *WILL* not relearn how to use *ANY*  
phone. I will not do sour apples against Apple alone it is *ALL*  
phones. It literally takes me a year to get used to any new phone  
even then I can't do simple things like add peoples phone numbers to  
it, I have to give it to a friend to do that. I also cannot figure  
out how to turn the ring off so if I am out with friends I hand my  
phone to them to do it. Yes I am a stuck in the mud person but I  
really do need a simple phone not one that has bells and whistles on  
it (like the iphone). Right now I am awaiting for my contract is up  
so I can switch phones so I can sync with ICAL.

The second to the last straw that Apple did was to come out with the  
MACBOOK air, its probably OK for people that have more money than  
brains.
