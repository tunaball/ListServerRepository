</I>No, not &quot;one of two people&quot;. There are others here who just didn't  
chime in.

&gt;<i> There are ways that Apple could insure those of us with older  
</I>&gt;<i> software can still run it, they've just chosen to ignore them.
</I>Sure they could but then what would be the price of software? Do you  
think that it costs nothing?


&gt;<i> Why is it I can run software written for a PDP-11 or VAX in the 70's  
</I>&gt;<i> in a legal and supported fashion on an Intel Mac,
</I>Really, what are the programs?


&gt;<i> yet I can't run ClarisDraw which was written in the mid-90's in a  
</I>&gt;<i> supported fashion?
</I>Because ClarisDraw was written for an older operating system on  
another microprocessor. If you really need ClarisDraw so much then run  
it on an old dedicated machine.


&gt;<i> The PDP-11 and VAX are minicomputers produced by DEC (i.e. something  
</I>&gt;<i> varying in size between a very large tower to something that fills a  
</I>&gt;<i> room), yet ClarisDraw is owned by Apple.
</I>And? Do you not understand that PDP-11 and VAX are not consumer  
oriented devices? An Apple Mac is. The Mac costs far, far less. What  
about the yearly maintenance fees/service contracts that PDP-11 and  
VAX users pay? If you want longevity then there's a price to pay. I  
surely don't want to pay that kind of money for Mac OS upgrades so  
that you old codgers can run your beloved old software that &quot;simply  
can't be replaced&quot; by anything. If you don't want to move on, stay  
with the old equipment and don't complain about changes.


&gt;<i> As for your BS about hardware, I'm typing this on an Apple ADB  
</I>&gt;<i> Extended II Keyboard hooked up to my G5 2x2,
</I>Only because someone made an adapter. What are you going to do when  
the adapter dies?


&gt;<i> and as far as I know I'll still be able to use this keyboard on an  
</I>&gt;<i> Intel Mac when I finally get one.  My printer is an HP 5MP which is  
</I>&gt;<i> even older.
</I>&gt;<i> On my WinXP box, I use a keyboard that came with my 486/33 in '91.   
</I>&gt;<i> These are examples that show why everything now has built in  
</I>&gt;<i> obsolescence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While my G5 is my primary system, my secondary system is an Alpha  
</I>&gt;<i> running OpenVMS, the hardware on it mostly dates back to the 90's,  
</I>&gt;<i> and some of the software is far older than than any of my Mac  
</I>&gt;<i> software, yet I'm running the current version of OpenVMS. Some  
</I>&gt;<i> companies really do understand that backwards compatibility is  
</I>&gt;<i> important.
</I>If your Alpha system is so good then you should be running it as your  
primary system and not need a Mac.


&gt;<i> Your comments show what is wrong with society today.
</I>Nothing is wrong with society today. All you guys want to do is  
complain.
