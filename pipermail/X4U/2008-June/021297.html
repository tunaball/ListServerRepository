On 6/16/08 11:09 PM, &quot;Christopher Collins&quot;  wrote an exciting message that
when I read it on 6/16/08 11:09 PM, I became so enthusiastic, I was forced
to take an extra Xanax.

Dear List:
I think a lot of you are getting annoyed by my posts.  I am going to make
this last one for awhile (usually I just 'lurk').  But, this is an excellent
example of the use of Modern Apple hardware and software.  Mind you, I am no
expert in any way, just an end user.
My partner and I just recently took a trip to Europe, a week in Barcelona
then a 13 day Western Mediterranean Cruise (Barcelona to Southampton), then
a week in London.  It was TONS of fun.  I took my MacBook, iPhone and Sony
Camera.  He took his MacBook Pro, iPhone and digital SLR camera.  Each day
we downloaded our pictures in our laptops--were able to do some simple
editing and sharing via iPhoto.  We were able to use our iPhones to call
back to the US or anywhere in Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and the UK.
All we had to do was add an international calling plan through AT&amp;T.  We
were even able to upload pictures taken with the iPhones to the laptops.
Having a .Mac account allowed us to post pictures for the family and friends
to see as we simply uploaded them using iWeb, all of this could be done in
about a half an hour at the end of the day.  We used the wifi connection on
the ship and got wifi in the hotel in London.  Barcelona has public wifi
networks and we never DID not have a connection there.
Now, tell me, would I have been able to do the same with an older G4 or G3
laptop and no iPhones?  And God forbid that we would have taken PC's....that
would have been a nightmare.
I'd like to share our photos with you also, here is the site:
&lt;<A HREF="http://web.mac.com/collierof1957/Mediterranean_Cruise/Barcelona.html">http://web.mac.com/collierof1957/Mediterranean_Cruise/Barcelona.html</A>&gt;
Anyway, all this is going to change (for the better with the new 'me'
upgrade of .Mac) with the new Push thingy (remember, no expert here, just an
end user).
Enjoy the pictures and I know for a FACT that I could not have done all this
without modern Apple hardware and software.
I'll shut up for a while now.
