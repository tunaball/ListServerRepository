OK, folks, enough already, please.

I think the discussion has reached the point where the real issue now  
is pride. I've watched this sort of thing on many lists over time, and  
I note that what happens seems to be that some persons feel his or her  
pride has been injured and ends up trying to preserve it by attacking  
the other person's pride &#8212; all in the disguise of rational discussion  
&#8212; which of course invites counter-retaliation, and on and on.

Perfectly decent and honorable people get caught up in this, so I  
intend no personal criticism in what I'm saying here. But I do suggest  
that it would be good for the list and good for the individuals who  
are struggling with wounded pride (however unwittingly they do so)  
simply to let it go. It's tough, as I know from personal experience,  
but truly, how about just simply not pursuing this issue at all any  
more?

OK; now let's see whether I will need to defend my pride against some  
disagreeable respondant. . . .  ;-)

Thanks to everyone.

Ray
