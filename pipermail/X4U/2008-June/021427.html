<PRE>I sent out an email without checking it out completely. I saw that HP  
announced a NEW think computer , I went to the HP web site and sent  
out a description that I thought was it. It wasn't.

Here is the corrected item.

HP's Ultra-Mobile Voodoo 'Envy' Targets Apple Air

The laptop includes Ethernet and Wi-Fi wireless connectivity, an  
external optical disk drive that ships with each unit, and a multiple  
gesture touchpad.

Hewlett-Packard on Tuesday introduced an ultra-portable notebook it  
expects would get matched up against Apple's thin MacBook Air and  
other high-end lightweight notebooks.

The Voodoo Envy 133, unveiled at HP's Connecting Your World event in  
Berlin, is a half-inch thick with a 13.3-inch display. The portable  
weighs 3.4 pounds and is powered by Intel's Centrino mobile platform.

The MacBook Air, introduced in January, has a similar size screen and  
is three-quarters of an inch in the back, tapering to 0.16 of an inch  
at its thinnest point. The machine weighs three pounds and is powered  
by an Intel Core 2 Duo processor.

In addition to the Air, the HP Envy would go up against the Lenovo  
ThinkPad X300, which weighs less than three pounds at its base  
configuration, has a 13.3-inch display, and is powered by an Intel  
Core 2 Duo processor. The Air, X300 and the Envy have LED displays,  
which are of higher visual quality then LCD screens found on most  
notebooks.

The Voodoo Envy includes Ethernet and Wi-Fi wireless connectivity, an  
external optical disk drive that ships with each unit, and a multiple  
gesture touchpad that supports, for example, circular movements for  
scrolling and pinch options for sizing windows.

The Voodoo brand is HP's high-end computers, many of which are used  
by gamers and graphics professionals. The Envy 133 will have a  
starting price of $2,099 and is scheduled to ship this summer.  
Apple's MacBook Air has a starting price of $1799, and the ThinkPad  
X300 starts at about $2,500.

Along with the Envy, HP introduced a new Voodoo desktop called the  
Omen. Built for gamers and professional users, the Omen supports up  
to four graphics processing units and features integrated copper  
liquid cooling pipes. Pricing starts at $7,000 and general  
availability is scheduled for this summer.
