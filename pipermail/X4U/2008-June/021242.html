<PRE>Now there, Ed!

You need to settle down and have a nice refreshing glass of Steve's  
Kool-Aid. You'll feel right as rain and be happy to spend $199 (plus a  
2 year contact) for your new iPhone so you can have the privilege of  
buying your applications/music/movies from the stores.

But honestly, I'm not mad at Apple and co. I'm mad at me, us, and  
everyone else who keeps encouraging them. Apple keeps making money  
because we keep spending it in their direction. When we spend it, we  
vote. &quot;We&quot; have been voting in favour of the iPhone, the MacBook Air  
and Leopard. Ignorant fools that we are...

I'll be dammed if I'm going to pay for Snow Leopard. I've been paying  
for Leopard every day since I bought and installed it.  Bug fixes have  
been slow to come and I'm not about to pay for them just because Apple  
put's a name on them. I bought a defective product and I want it  
fixed. Now! I don't pay to be a beta tester, I get paid to be one!!!

Yes, M$ is much, much worse, and there isn't a flavour of Linux that  
I'm comfortable enough with to switch to full time yet. But the reason  
the grass is so green 'over here' is because we've had so much  
fertilizer spread around lately.

Dave
(Yes Ed, I agree with you fully! Let the flames begin...)

4 ''pearls'' that are vital to success in the software industry.

2 Things to avoid...
Underestimating yourself
Overestimating your competition

2 Things to remember...
The customer is not only right - but they are EVERYTHING
The code will NEVER be finished to your own satisfaction - define what  
you want to release then release there - the temptation to just keep  
adding features is over powering.
