Ed, you have told us  in the past about your problems these days with 
learning and remembering things. So I write with the the kindliest 
intentions. I just want to suggest that millions of people use iPods 
without any problem at all. And there is a real market demand for a 
small, portable computer where someone can do internet, email, work 
on a PowerPoint presentation, write a document, do a little research, 
generate some graphs, and so on, without requiring a CD drive or a 
printer. It's not just for rich CEOs - it's for lots of executives, 
managers, IT people, training developers who have to visit engineers, 
labs, and so on - and gather data for later massaging. In fact, I 
could go on and on. The lightness, unobtrusiveness, portability, and 
instant availability of the MacBook Air make it very desirable to 
lots of people.

It is getting to be a pain to see you criticizing people's choice of 
tools when the criticism is based only on your own experience and 
limitations.
