<PRE>Dave,

I do have other alternatives.
I am in Europe, and I go have a GSM cellular device that can be  
placed in a line of sight position with respect to a cell tower  
signal, and this device has a wi-fi &quot;g&quot; transceiver so I can connect  
using airport.

There are also &quot;sticks&quot; that slip into the USB port that connect me  
with the cell tower.

So, I have alternatives. i just need to determine which one is the  
least intrusive.

Thanks for the food for thought that you provided.

Lee,

It sounds to me like this is probably your best option. As long as  
you keep in mind the range from land based cell networks, and the  
other issues I previously mentioned. I did notice that there is no  
mention of an external antenna or connection for one, so you may have  
to get creative with the installation. The only 3G routers I've seen  
all had directional antenna's in them and had to be 'aimed' at the  
closest cell tower. And don't forget that you are dealing with 2-way  
communications and the 3G transmitter in this router is, I'd guess,  
less than 0.5W. It will have limited range, especially in rain or  
high humidity, so even if you are able to receive a signal, you may  
not be able to send one back.

Just to qualify, I have never been on a boat that was out of sight of  
shore, never mind trying to use a cellular device in such an  
instance. Have you tried to use an iPhone or other 3G device in the  
situations you will be encountering? Will it be used just when  
moored, or while under way? Do you get far from shore? Will you be  
able to install the router in a window facing shore and cell towers?

Many carriers offer a 30 day no questions asked return policy on  
devices like these, so you may be able to take one for a 'test drive'  
with no commitment if it does not work in your situation.
