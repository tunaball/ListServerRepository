The USB spec doesn't say 'for 10 minutes'. If it had a USB port for 
plugging a drive (of any sort) into, it would have to have to be able 
to supply 0.5A until the battery failed.  If they put a USB port on 
there there would be legal action because it couldn't drive a 0.5A 
disc and get anything like the 10 hour battery life. The anti-Apple 
brigade would have a field day. As far as I know a 'Camera Port' 
isn't a defined thing, so it can have whatever spec they like. In 
practice it may work with any USB device with its own power source, 
but connect it to anything other than a camera and you can't complain 
if it doesn't work or the battery life drops.

Yes, but think disc end, not computer end. A wire with a flat plug on 
it rather than the big square or mini plug.
