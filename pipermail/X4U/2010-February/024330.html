No need to get worked up, John. I am not saying that SL is a steaming  
pile, simply that it is for some, not production-ready.

Some Blender users (and myself) are not 100% sure that Blender 2.49a  
and SL play nicely together. I've seen a couple of wierd things which  
do not happen in Leopard.

The Blender developers are pouring all effort into Blender 2.6, so  
2.49a will not be adjusted to deal with these wierdnesses.

I've also found Inkscape to be a little wierd. It could be X11  
itself, tho. The wierd things I've seen don't happen in regular leopard.

As I have suggested previously, I do most of my work in regular  
Leopard. As apps which are important to me become stable in Snow  
Leopard, I will migrate to it gradually.

Blender, Inkscape and Gimp are 3 very high-quality applications and  
are very important to very many people. We won't chuff them aside  
simply because they do not now work 100% well in Snow Leopard. We  
know that they will in time.

I am puzzled why some of you are having an emotional episode at the  
innocent statement that Snow Leopard isn't production-ready for  
everyone.

Why should this be such a problem for you? It doesn't impugn your  
integrity or even that of Apple. it's simply an observation...one  
guy's opinion.

cheers!

zc
