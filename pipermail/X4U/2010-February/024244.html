<PRE>Michael,

I have to respectfully disagree, they are computers. Handheld computers with CPU's, GPU's, RAM, etc. And they are running a modified version of OS X. The limitations that are imposed on them are done so by Apple. Many people, myself included, do not like or agree with these limitations. But as you point out, this isn't Apple's problem (yet).

I understand that Apple has decided to limit what these devices can do to 'enhance the user experience'. More correctly, to dumb them down so the average person isn't overwhelmed with them. And to also prevent the cannibalization of sales of notebooks, like the Newton did back in the late '90's. If my iPhone (or the iPad) had the functionality of my MacBook Pro, why would I need my MacBook Pro? Apple the hardware company wants to sell hardware. Apple the content provider wants to sell content. The iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad address both these concerns, and make it easy for everyone with a credit card to be a consumer.

Apple has 'raised the bar' in the mobile device arena with the iPhone and the App Store. There can be no doubting this. But that does not mean that the bar is as high as it can, or should, go. The iPad has not raised the bar any higher, though I'm fairly certain it will raise Apples revenue. Maybe the next generation iPad will offer more of what I'm looking for. Or maybe another eco-system (of hardware and supporting services) will be developed that does. Time will tell.
