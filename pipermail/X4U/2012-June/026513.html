Hi, Paul!

If the savvy system gurus on this list don't answer your question 
rather quickly, consider getting in touch directly with Brother 
International. My access to them has been through the Brother-USA 
site:

      &lt;<A HREF="http://www.brother-usa.com/askus/default.aspx?PGID=1">http://www.brother-usa.com/askus/default.aspx?PGID=1</A>&gt;

and their associated U.S. telephone support line, 1-877-BROTHER 
(877-276-8437); so your international contact points will probably be 
different. Nevertheless, if your experience with them is even the 
slightest bit like the few I've had, you'll get your answer with 
authority, accuracy, and dispatch.

I can not name another company from whom I've gotten better support. 
For example, about a year and a half ago, I began to experience 
strange results from some of the obscure reaches of one of my Brother 
printers' performance envelope (e.g., two-sided printing became very 
inconsistent, plus other mysteries). When I reached a Brother support 
specialist, he first had me perform some quick tests, by which he 
narrowed the problem down to a recent Apple system upgrade whose 
embedded printer drivers apparently had some major deficiencies 
regarding Brother printers. My support representative transmitted me 
a replacement driver developed by Brother itself, guided me step by 
step through the replacement of the defective &quot;improvement&quot;, and 
stayed with me until testing confirmed that all was again well.

This example is why I suggest that Brother may be willing and able to 
help you, even if the problem is not one for which they are 
responsible. At the very least, I'd expect them to go a long way 
toward identifying the source of your problem, even if they don't 
have the cure at their fingertips.

Over the six or more years I've used Brother printers, I have had a 
couple of other experiences; and they, too were handled in a 
professional and caring manner by the telephone support folks. The 
website itself is a well-designed dispenser of information, including 
user manuals and the like.

I should hasten to say that I have no relation to Brother, other than 
as a satisfied user of an HL-6050DN black and white laser model and 
an MFC-845CW color inkjet all-in-one for several years. Based on my 
good experience with both the products and support, I now have 
purchased an MFC-9970CDW color laser all-in-one unit, which is 
awaiting my set-up to replace the two older printers (for physical 
space reasons).

Good luck,
John French
