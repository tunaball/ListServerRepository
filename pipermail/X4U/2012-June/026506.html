He also used some of his graduation money to pick up a new iPod.  One of the questions that I haven't had much time to think about is what is the best way to handle our music/app/movie library.  Up until this time everyone in the house has used the Home Sharing feature and everything has been downloaded under one Apple ID.

</I>&gt;<i>If I remember authentication has to happen for items using that account, and the more I look at this, it seems like it has the potential to be a mess (because as he moves out of the house, I don't want him to have that account info).  I'm assuming someone else has done this before.  Does anyone have advice on this process?  Or the gotchas of sorting this out?

If all of your machines are new enough for Apples newest (i, lion)OS iCloud is likely an answer.

But it sure won't work on this 8500 and I'm not sure the school will support iCloud because of bandwidth considerations.
