<PRE>I worked with my kids to ensure that they had purchased their own copies of everything by the time that they finished college.  This gave them a chance to figure out what they actually wanted.

We also helped out with a bunch of gift cards over the years.

Note that music is DRM-free.

The big issue is that iDevices now use up one of the device activations under your account, so laptop + ipad + phone can use up three per kid (:-).

&gt;<i> So my son just graduated from high school and will be headed off to college in the fall.  He just had his college visit where he got his computer (A MacBook Pro).  He also used some of his graduation money to pick up a new iPod.  One of the questions that I haven't had much time to think about is what is the best way to handle our music/app/movie library.  Up until this time everyone in the house has used the Home Sharing feature and everything has been downloaded under one Apple ID.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I remember authentication has to happen for items using that account, and the more I look at this, it seems like it has the potential to be a mess (because as he moves out of the house, I don't want him to have that account info).  I'm assuming someone else has done this before.  Does anyone have advice on this process?  Or the gotchas of sorting this out?
