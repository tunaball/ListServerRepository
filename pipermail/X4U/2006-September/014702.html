<PRE>Hi, Robert 

I totally share your frustration with this issue. This technique below
worked great for me - and made me be able to tolerate the Cmd-f finder.

In addition to this technique of setting a default for cmd-f,  I actually
made 5 - 10 smart folder searches ( the correct starting folder or hard
drive etc. and the correct criteria presets) - and saved them all to a
special folder - which I keep as folder alias on the left side Finder
window.  That way - I simply create a new Finder window then click to the
appropriate smart folder - and everything is already right there! And -
guess what - the first one that I made - was the same requests that you had
when you started this thread!

Revert to the previous Find window

Do you dislike Tiger&#185;s default Find window? You want to search for a file
name, so you press Command-F, only to be faced with the Kind: Any and Last
Opened: Any Date search fields, forcing you to manually add the Name:
Contains setting. If you miss the old way of doing things, here&#185;s how to
turn back the clock.

First, create a new smart folder. Delete the second search setting (Last
Opened: Any Date) by clicking on the minus sign (-) to its right. Then use
the pull-down menus to change the Kind: Any setting to Name: Contains. In
the file-name box, type something short that you know won&#185;t appear
elsewhere&#139;for example, use three vertical bars (||| ).While you&#185;re at it,
set the window&#185;s size and position. When you&#185;re done, click on the Save
button, name the smart folder whatever you like (you&#185;ll rename it later),
and save it to your desktop. Switch to the Finder and navigate to /System/
Library/CoreServices. Control-click on the Finder entry, and select Show
Package Contents. In the new window that appears, go to /Contents/
Resources. Drag the file named default_smart.plist to your Documents folder,
or to any location other than your desktop. This will serve as your backup
file, in case you need to restore the original file later. Leaving the
Resources window open, press Command-N to open a new Finder window, navigate
to your desktop, and rename the new smart folder default_smart .plist. Click
on the Use .plist option when the Finder asks whether you&#185;re sure you want
to make this change.

Finally, drag your new default_ smart.plist folder into the Resources
folder. The Finder will ask for your admin password and will ask you to
confirm that you want to overwrite the existing file. Once you&#185;ve replaced
the file, close the window.

To see your changes in action, restart the Finder. The easiest way to do
this is to option-click on the Finder icon in the Dock and choose Relauch
from the pop-up menu. Now when you press Command-F, you should see your
newly customized Find window in all its glory; you&#185;ll just have to replace
the file-name field with the search text.&#139;RG
