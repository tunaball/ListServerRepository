Me, either, to be honest. On a Mac, it's difficult to think of any I  
might use - the memory slots &amp; hard-drive space is far more important.

&gt;<i> ...I will not run a desktop with a built in monitor
</I>
Why do you say this?
I'm glad it's not just me that feels this way!!

If I were to look at the cost of iMacs &amp; their resale value, I might  
find my dismissal of them to be a little bit irrational, but  
nevertheless I feel that in buying an iMac I would be buying a  
monitor that I'd be obliged to &quot;throw away&quot; when I upgrade my PC. All- 
in-one Macs just seem so &quot;wasteful&quot; to me.

&gt;<i> and I'm drooling over the thought of a Mac with 4 HD bays.
</I>
Yeah, I have to say I perked up a little bit when I read about that.

&gt;&gt;<i> If you order a MacPro you don't HAVE to have 2 x quad-cores.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There's a build-to-order option that allows you to elect only a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single quad-core processor and - here in the UK - it shaves about

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> affordable, about what I've paid for Power Macs in the past, when  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the cheaper options have been available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True, but I prefer mid-range, for extending the life of the machine

</I>&gt;<i> + years.  When the time comes to upgrade, I very likely will go  
</I>&gt;<i> with the low-end model this time ...
</I>
I'm not convinced a computer with &quot;only&quot; a quad-core processor is  
entirely &quot;low end&quot;. ;)

I've never been sure that an extra core is as good as an extra  
processor, but feel I'm unlikely to complain over the speed of a quad- 
core Xeon. It did  occur to me that the build-to-order single quad- 
core MacPro is likely to share the same motherboard as the one with  
two quad-cores, so it might be possible to upgrade it economically in  
the future. I don't know all of which processors might fit this  
machine - or the full details of Intel's Core2 range (could one find  
cheaper, non-Xeon quad-cores that would fit?) - but I notice (for  
instance) that 3 year-old Dell servers go quite reasonably on eBay,  
and one might find quad-cores installed in current models of those.
