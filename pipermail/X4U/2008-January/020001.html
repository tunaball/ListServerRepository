But you are attacking people Ed. You keep telling them they have &quot;more  
money than brains&quot; because they can see that the Air fills a need for  
them and they are prepared to pay the extra dollars necessary to own  
an Air.

That is not a &quot;discussion&quot; That is a direct insult to people like me  
and Linda (I think) who can see the Air as being a good purchase for  
our needs.

Is the Air prefect? No, it isn't. A built in CD or DVD would be a good  
thing. I'm sure there are other things other people would like built  
in as standard.

But with current technology, that is not possible. Maybe down the  
track it will be.

Does the Air fit your needs? Obviously not. And thats fine too. It was  
obviously not designed too.

But that doesn't make someone who sees it as an answer to their  
problems, someone who has &quot;more money than brains&quot;. They have  
different requirements to you. They need a different laptop to you.

At this point in time, the Air might or might not fill their  
needs.Thats up to them.

I'm not trying to convince anyone that the Air is the &quot;perfect  
laptop&quot;. The &quot;perfect laptop&quot; does not, and never will, exist.

But for my requirements, the Air comes close. And &quot;I&quot;, and I am only  
speaking for me personally, see the Air as a good purchase. It will  
help my back. It will make my traveling easier because it weighs less  
and is thinner. And thats all I ask of it on a long trip. Simple.

And for the record, please don't assume that all CEOs are stupid and  
not tech savvy. Many of us are quite tech savvy and know exactly what  
we want and are prepared to pay for it.
