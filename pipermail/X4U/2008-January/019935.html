And for me, &quot;Y&quot; would be slightly smaller but with a tougher case than  
the 12&quot; PB G4. Imagine the 12&quot; iBook, just smaller. Or the original  
iBook. Or better yet the Newton based eMate 300. That is why the ASUS  
Eee PC device caught my eye. I was even more intrigued when I found  
out it is running Linux and that some have managed to get Tiger  
installed on it.

To clarify, I have a Nokia E61 phone and a MacBook Pro 15&quot;. I'd like  
something that falls between them size wise and is rugged enough to  
not require a padded protective case. It would be a &quot;take anywhere&quot;  
machine - I currently don't go to far from home without my MBP, and  
that is a bother.  WiFi is a must. Bluetooth would be highly  
desirable. A webcam would be nice. A tiny charger (Like the eMate 300  
had) and a couple hours of real use, not 'best case/minimal power/ 
optimized use' are both required. An available car charger would be an  
asset, but I have a small inverter so it isn't that important. Storage  
space could be low because other than the OS, most other files would  
be temporarily on the machine. 20 GB would be plenty.

Intended uses include email, web browsing, basic document work (PDF,  
spreadsheets, presentations, etc), music/podcast and video playback,  
PIM functions (iCal and Address Book), remote computer access via SSH  
and VNC/Remote Desktop, GPS navigation, and possibly some light games  
for my son. I'd like to also be able to use an iSync like feature with  
my main Mac, or possibly even a private .Mac like server running at  
home.

Obviously this can be accomplished with existing technology, I just  
wish it had an Apple logo and OS on it when it came out of the box.

Regards,
Dave
