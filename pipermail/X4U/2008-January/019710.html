Ooops. There are a number of items stored in different keychains,  
which are therefore visible in the &quot;Keychain Access&quot; program.

In the left-hand pane of Keychain Access are a number of categories.  
I think that the stuff one might most safely delete are &quot;Passwords&quot; -  
I have certainly deleted these if, for instance, I have changed the  
password on a wireless router and I want to reenter its password (the  
new one) next time I connect.

I see that the &quot;Certificates&quot; category includes stuff from Thwaite &amp;  
Verisign - I know those are companies that provide &quot;secure&quot; website  
certificates to banks &amp; e-commerce websites, so I assume these are  
the master certificates that ship with the o/s so that Safari knows  
these sites are &quot;safe&quot; without you having to tell it so.

I note that I also have certificates from named individuals - Bob  
Smith &amp; the like - as certificates, but upon inspection these are  
generally signed or issued by one of those larger authorities named  
above (this sort of signing supports delegation) so I assume that  
these have been added automatically when I have visited sites.

&gt;<i> We still have the G3 portable to pull information from if we need  
</I>&gt;<i> to reinstall from there. If we do need to restore these  
</I>&gt;<i> certificates, where would I find them and where are they accessed  
</I>&gt;<i> in the system?
</I>
   $ sudo find / -iname &quot;*.keychain&quot;
   /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
   /Users/stroller/Library/Keychains/login.keychain
   $

Note also that there's a &quot;Microsoft_Intermediate_Certificates&quot; file  
in ~/Library/Keychains/&quot;. I guess it could be that that's b0rked?

I know you can copy keychains from one machine to the other - I have  
done to migrate all my saved passwords from my old laptop to my new  
one - but exercise caution and backup the original files (from now  
on, anyway!). I haven't poked my nose in the full implications of  
moving keychain files around, and I guess there may be a potential  
for locking oneself out of one's user account (no problem if the  
machine can be mounted in target mode &amp; changes revoked, I assume). I  
think it's possible to have a different user &amp; keychain passwords,  
and that this might produce behaviour which may surprise or confuse  
the unprepared user.

Stroller.
