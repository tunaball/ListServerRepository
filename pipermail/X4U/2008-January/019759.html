<PRE>We live in such an accelerated society! Apple 'has' to outdo itself  
every year?

Not sure if 1080i is higher quality? Maybe someone with more  
experience can shed light on this?  I don't watch many movies so I  
don't really have an opinion as to whether this new service is good or  
bad.

I know lots of people who would find those more powerful Mac Book  
laptops totally useless. &quot;Who would want to read their email during  
the day?&quot;

  My guess is that there will be brisk demand for this new sleek unit.

&gt;<i> I thought that when Apple introduced new Mac Pros two weeks ago, it

</I>&gt;<i> ask me) drools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't understand why Apple announced the new Mac Pros before Mac  
World. Maybe two weeks of sales were important? I suspect that an  
announcement at MW would have been received as ho-hum stuff?

&gt;<i> I didn't see the Keynote, so I don't know how much information was  
</I>&gt;<i> made
</I>&gt;<i> available about the iPhone software development toolkit. Whether  
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise
</I>&gt;<i> mobile platform developers embrace it will be far more important, in  
</I>&gt;<i> my
</I>&gt;<i> view, than a stupidly-named laptop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I kind of see this new laptop as a pretty big change in direction for  
Apple. Sort of like when they dropped floppy drives. I can't see not  
having a CD/DVD drive included with the laptop. Maybe in 5 years it  
will be normal?
