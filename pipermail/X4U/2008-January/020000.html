It's easier to convert a new computer user than an old Windoze user.
The former has no baggage.  The latter has built years of experience
with a particular workflow.  Your greatest challenge is to understand
what they do, show them how to do that on the Mac, and train them to
use new tools on the Mac when their old tools only exist on Windoze.
Given her history with FrontPage, I would not have tried to convert
your friend in the first place.  However, I'd also tell her that I
would provide free tech support only if she converted to a Mac.
