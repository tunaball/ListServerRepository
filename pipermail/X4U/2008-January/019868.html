Wendy,
I must admit that my comment was extremely rude and uncalled for. 
The problem is I don't like seeing people get ripped off, and as far 
as I was concerned when I wrote that, that was what Apple is doing. 
Realizing that the MacBook only ships with 1Gb, makes the price of 
the MacBook Air a bit more reasonable[1].  I still think that the 
MacBook is the better choice, and that people would be better off 
spending the difference on something else.  But then *ANY* of today's 
laptops, including the 17&quot; models, are lightweight compared to the 
ones I started traveling with.

As for the &quot;more money than brains&quot;, even I've been known to make 
laptop purchases that fall into that category.

I am curious about one thing, everyone is interested in the weight 
aspect, shoot that's what interests me about it, that and the size. 
How many people care about the thickness (I don't)?  I think that 
part of why it costs so much is the thickness, yet I would think that 
if they'd gone a little thicker they could have saved money, and 
still come in at about the same weight.  That special CPU can't be 
cheap, and might be the reason for the $550-700 price difference.

[1] The MacBook itself is overpriced.
