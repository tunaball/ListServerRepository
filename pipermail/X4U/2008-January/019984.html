Maybe if you had gotten an education you could earn a decent living  
and not have so much hatred, caused by envy, eating you up inside.

&gt;<i> Look people I am not attacking Apple
</I>
I know, you have been attacking my little sister instead.  That's  
worse, not better.  Yes, she is a CEO, but she didn't get there by  
being as stupid as you claim.  I don't know what some CEO did to you  
to cause you to be filled with so much hate, envy, and aggression,  
but my little sister was NOT the one who did it to you, so I  
respectfully ask you to cease and desist all the nasty invective  
directed at her.  Yes, at only 105 pounds, I'm sure she doesn't have  
as much muscle  as you.   Also, my great aunt Thelma at 85 years of  
age has been crippled by arthritis, but she still likes to travel. Do  
you realize how mean you sound when you attack them for being frail  
and disabled?  I'm glad you are still young and strong, but you need  
to be a little more tolerant of people who have different abilities.   
They are both human beings and therefor entitled to a modicum of  
respect even if they are/were CEOs.  In the spirit of compromise,  
maybe we can let great aunt Thelma get a MB-A and offset that by  
kicking her out of her wheelchair and telling her to just &quot;suck it  
up.&quot; After all, YOU get by fine without a wheelchair and you get  
infuriated at those people who buy  them because they have more money  
than brains.
