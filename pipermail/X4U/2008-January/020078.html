<PRE>G'day all,

I'm still trying to get Windows installed onto a partition on my  
MBPro....

After having ridiculously slow results with downloading the bit  
torrent &quot;WINXP with SP2&quot; file and giving up, I've been having a go at  
trying to build my own Windows XP bootable CD with Service Pack 2 -  
but I'm having troubles. I printed off the instruction page from one  
of the slipstreaming links Christopher recommended and have been  
trying to follow it:

<A HREF="http://www.technipages.com/how-to-slipstream-windows-xp-service-pack-2.html">http://www.technipages.com/how-to-slipstream-windows-xp-service-pack-2.html</A>

As explained in my previous post, I have a WinXP CD with SP1 built-in.  
According to the Boot Camp docs and you guys I need it to have SP2  
built-in. I have since successfully slipstreamed the SP2 into a folder  
copy of the Windows XP installer disc (on my old PC's c drive). As  
instructed in the technote, I downloaded the &quot;Microsoft  
Corporation.img&quot; file from the MS website (apparently this file is  
used to make the CD a bootable disc).

I then used Nero 6 (v6.6.1.5a) to burn a bootable CD of the  
slipstreamed WinXP copy but my Nero 6 didn't have any of the manual  
settings the technote told me Nero 6 should have, in fact I couldn't  
find the specific &quot;Nero Burning ROM 6&quot; application. Instead I had a  
more GUI main interface that only gave me the &quot;Bootable CD&quot; option  
that had lots less options than the technote showed and didn't allow  
me to choose the downloaded &quot;Microsoft Corporation.img&quot; file prior to  
burning. Instead I was given 2 options: 1) select a bootable floppy  
disk in drive A or 2) use Nero's built-in bootable ROMs and simply  
choose a language (English). I chose the latter coz I didn't have a  
bootable floppy.

But when I booted my Mac off the burned CD I got a buncha disgnostics  
messages and a &quot;No NTFS volumes found, exiting...&quot; message followed by  
a DOS prompt that I didn't have the ability to input into.

Initially I thought my MBPro's FAT32 partition wasn't being recognised  
so I used Leopard's &quot;Boot Camp Assistant&quot; to rebuild a new Windows  
partition but that made no difference. Suspecting the Nero burn was  
the culprit I tried booting directly off my original Windows XP disc  
and it booted up fine. I aborted the install and tried making another  
burn in Nero.

This time I asked my neighbour (Java Script programmer) for his help.  
He was stumped also but suggested we format a floppy disc (choosing  
the bootable disc option) and use Nero to choose it as the bootable  
image (as in option 1 above) instead of using Nero's built-in ROMs  
(option 2). This time when booting off the disc on my Mac we received  
less diagnostics messages and a speedy DOS prompt appeared that we had  
control over but we couldn't do anything with it.

So I'm so stuck for a solution right now.

Basically I have a WindowsXP folder with Service Pack 2 integrated  
into it. I have the downloaded boot .img from the MS site and a CD  
ready for burning. How do I achieve this end result???

Your help is most appreciated!!!

Cheers,

Cojcolds
</PRE>
