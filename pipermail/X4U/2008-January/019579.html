Okay, Michael, so both you and Linda think Disk Warrior should be  
given another chance at it, and we may as well try that.

My husband thought that after having Erased the drive, when he  
couldn't even mount a disk to install, that there wasn't a directory  
for Disk Warrior to rebuild. Is he simply wrong? (These things aren't  
exactly the most portable, so we haven't toted it to our house yet to  
work on. It's still at my mother's house.)

I was finally able to consult the Alsoft Knowledge base (when I'd  
first tried, its pages wouldn't load, so I decided to consult this  
list). I am now very confused, as it says the &quot;speed inhibited by  
disk malfunction&quot; message indicates a hardware problem, like a hard  
drive failure, whereas everything I've read about Disk Utility's  
message that the &quot;Keys out of order&quot; and &quot;B-tree&quot; is software  
related. Plus, the hard drive had passed the SMART function test of  
Disk Warrior. However, we are  vaguely remembering something else in  
the recent past--something which had made us install SMART Reporter  
on the iMac to begin with, which may indicate that the drive was  
going bad. Frankly, the hard drive would be preferable (cheaper), I  
think.

Also on the Alsoft Knowledge base, they suggest running Disk Warrior  
in target mode to .  I do have an extra clamshell (with 10.4.11; I  
use it in the kitchen) I can use to run Disk Warrior with the iMac in  
target mode, and just leave it running without inconveniencing anyone.

I'll keep your offer in mind, Michael, should this not work.
