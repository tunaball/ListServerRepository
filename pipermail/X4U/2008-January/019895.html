I really don't care that much about the PCI slot 
issue, I don't have any cards in my G5, if I did 
add something it would be an eSATA card.  I 
decided to go FireWire for my audio interface 
when I learned that my Darla24 wouldn't work in 
my G4/450 AGP (it had been in my 8500/180).  I do 
care about the RAM, I will not run a desktop with 
a built in monitor, and I'm drooling over the 
thought of a Mac with 4 HD bays.

</I>&gt;<i>present.
</I>
I'm curious as to which apps.  I do know the 
latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader is quite 
sluggish.  I'm still using 6.0.2 Professional. 
IIRC, the Dreamweaver CS3 demo I tried was 
sluggish as well.  I find Adobe Lightroom to work 
quite nicely on my G5 2x2, though iPhoto has 
gotten very sluggish.  I think these are the 
extent of my complaints.  My G4/450 after 4 years 
was almost unusable it was so slow, same with the 
8500/180 after 2-3.

&gt;<i>If you order a MacPro you don't HAVE to have 2 x

</I>&gt;<i>allows you to elect only a single quad-core

</I>
True, but I prefer mid-range, for extending the 
life of the machine past 3 years.  Though any 
MacPro is likely to be very usable after 3+ 
years.  When the time comes to upgrade, I very 
likely will go with the low-end model this time, 
and spend the extra on more RAM (from a 3rd 
party, not Apple).

&gt;&gt;<i>  OTOH, I need plenty of disk space, and more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>than 4Gb RAM. Basically I need a Sun Ultra 24 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>running Mac OS X.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.sun.com/desktop/workstation/ultra24/index.xml">http://www.sun.com/desktop/workstation/ultra24/index.xml</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That is a very appealing price &amp; specification. 
</I>&gt;<i>I've never really used Sun, but it looks like 
</I>&gt;<i>they've hit a sweet spot for Unix workstations.
</I>
If I hadn't switched to Mac OS X for most of my 
Unix needs, I'd have ordered one the second I 
knew they were offering it.  I really want one to 
replace my SunBlade 1000 (2x600Mhz Ultra III's), 
as my current system generates so much heat I 
have to limit how much I use it.
