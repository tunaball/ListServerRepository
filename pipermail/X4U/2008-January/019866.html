Actually if you're on a trip like Linda was just on, I'll agree the 
&quot;Air&quot; makes more sense than a 17&quot; MacBook.  I understand why the 17&quot; 
makes sense for some people, but for me the 13&quot; MacBook makes more 
sense.

Actually I have a very good idea what a difference two pounds, the 
difference between the MacBook and the &quot;Air&quot;, make.

Apple is still selling systems with only 1Gb?!?!  I was about to say 
you need to check your facts, but thankfully I checked mine.  I'm 
guessing your $550 figure is the price of the MacBook upgraded to 
2Gb?  I still think the &quot;Air&quot; is overpriced, but once you take that 
into consideration it isn't as bad as I thought.

I suspect part of that difference is a more expensive CPU.  I still 
think the &quot;Air&quot; is overpriced, but then I also think the MacBook 
itself is overpriced.  It would also be interesting to know if their 
solution for RAM means that the system costs more than it would if it 
used standard Laptop RAM.  There are all the cost savings, they don't 
have all the ports of a standard MacBook, and they don't need RAM 
sockets.
