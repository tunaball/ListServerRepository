Okay, Dave, good for you. The MacBook Air was obviously not designed  
for you, your family or those you've spoken with and you have told us  
so twice already. Using such BS as &quot;Mac snobbery&quot; is totally out of  
line. The MB Air was simply not designed for those who want/need a  
MacBook Pro nor for those who want a $1099 MacBook nor for those who  
actually enjoy the experience of using a Windows machine, cheap or not.

The MacBook Air was designed perfectly for me and my business and for  
many people with whom I have communicated. It competes very well with  
the Windows alternatives that are similarly priced and does many  
things that none of them can do, one of which is critical--run Mac OS X.

Enjoy your Windows machine, Dave, and, oh... you were almost right  
about the market deciding if the MB Air will be successful. It is the  
market for these machines that will decide and not &quot;corporate&quot; markets.

-Bill
