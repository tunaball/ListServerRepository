</I>Wendy,

I used to travel extensively (3 out 4 weeks a month). I *NEVER*  
traveled lightly. Invariably I would have 2 (2 suit) cases and a  
brief case *AND* something else. At the minimum at least a computer  
(this was 15+ years ago and computers were a *LOT* heavier than  
today).  This was domestically and international. I will admit when I  
went on vacation the computer was left behind *UNLESS* I was on a  
work assignment and went directly on vacation.

I really never had a problem while on board a plane (of course I did  
fly first class). Once in a great while you get hassled by security  
for something about the computer but the weight was never a factor  
(err I take that back one time I was flying in the Caribbean and they  
wanted to weigh me and the computer on the scale so they could  
calculate the right amount of fuel).  That was just strange and made  
me want to switch over to a jet but I digress.
My computers over the years got the job done, yes the next upgrade I  
got a CDROM then the next upgrade I got a DVD/CDROM  player so I  
could listen/watch demo's from vendors while I was on the plane. It  
got to be mandatory to have an optical drive as part of the computer.  
I no longer travel but people who came after me (in the same job)  
tell me a optical drive is mandatory for most of their needs. Sure  
you can probably buy an external one but powering it on a plane is  
next to impossible.

I don't profess to know the limitations of any mac portable, but the  
people who carried on after I left have all said that (lots of)  
memory and optical drive are mandatory.

It was awkward getting on/off a plane
