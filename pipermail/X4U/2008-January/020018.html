<PRE>One of the things that I just don't understand is why there isn't more  
outrage within the Mac community regarding Quicken.  And, I might say,  
the situation is even more unfathomable given the fact that Bill  
Campbell in on the Board of Apple and yet Intuit treats Mac users in  
an extremely poor manner.

For me, I am a user of Quicken 2007 and have stupidly purchased almost  
all versions since Q1998 came on my original iMac Rev b.  The most  
recent event that shows Intuit's failure to perform has been several  
days with either lack of securities prices or difficultly in getting  
prices.  And, this in the midst of a ot of market volatility.  They  
have also made no effort to communicate to Mac users whereas they have  
tried to apologize to Windows users.  There has been no outright  
disclosure on the plans on Q2008 other than hints of a vaporware-like  
Quicken &quot;Life&quot; apparition that will not even equal the current poor  
functionality of Quicken for Mac with compared to the Windows  
version.  News from rumor sites has Quicken failing to provide  
functionality for investments and, in any event, they &quot;plan&quot; to issue  
the new software at end 2008, nearly a year late.

But my question is, Quicken for Mac is essentially the same  
application it was under 8.1.  It looks almost much the same as it did  
on my original iMac and has almost no additionally functionality.   
They say that we won't support Q2006 but no one knows why or what the  
difference is.  Intuit also wiped hundreds of hard disks out there  
lately.  And, yet Campbell is on the Board.  I don't understand the  
lack of outrage and Steve Job's putting up with this.  I thought Steve  
was a demanding person.

I think they are more evil than Microsoft and think that Bill Gates  
would be a better Board member than Campbell.

I can't find a viable alternative to Quicken for investments.  I am  
not interested in home checkbook management.  Are there any good  
programs out there that can service my needs for investment portfolio  
management as done today in Q2007?
