I won't buy such a system for the same reason that I won't buy a TV 
with a built in VHS or DVD player.  If one part dies, the whole thing 
is dead.  If the monitor dies, I can just plug in another one.  If 
the computer dies, I've a bit more of a problem.

Additionally at this moment plugged into this one monitor I have my 
G5 2x2 on the DVI input, then on the VGA input I have a WinXP box, 
Linux Box, DEC Alpha (running OpenVMS), and a SunBlade 1000.  I also 
have an SGI O2 that is occasionally plugged in.  So I have a good 
reason for an external monitor. :^)

&gt;&gt;<i>True, but I prefer mid-range, for extending the life of the machine

</I>&gt;<i>I'm not convinced a computer with &quot;only&quot; a quad-core processor is

</I>
Considering the &quot;low end&quot; model in this case, is only &quot;low end&quot; when 
compared with the Mac Pro, you might have a point.  I switched to the 
Mac with a PowerBook 520c (I had to have a laptop at that point). 
Since then my main Mac's have been the following 8500/180, G4/450 AGP 
(both the middle range tower at the time), and G5 dual 2Ghz (top of 
the line at the time).  I used the first for 3 years, the second for 
4, and I'm over 4 on the G5.  The first two took at most 1-2 years 
before they started to feel slow, the G5 only feels slow on a couple 
apps.

&gt;<i>I've never been sure that an extra core is as good as an extra 
</I>&gt;<i>processor, but feel I'm unlikely to complain over the speed of a 
</I>&gt;<i>quad-core Xeon.
</I>
The thing to remember about Multi-CPU systems is that it doesn't 
matter how good they are, a second CPU doesn't make your system 2x as 
fast.  Likewise a dual 4-core system won't be 8x as fast.  OTOH, 
those new Xeon CPU's have 12Mb L2 cache per CPU vs. 2-4Mb on the Core 
2 Duo.  That makes a real difference.  Of course how well written 
what you're running makes a difference as well.  A single threaded 
app will only run as fast as a single core.

&gt;<i>It did  occur to me that the build-to-order single quad-core MacPro 
</I>&gt;<i>is likely to share the same motherboard as the one with two 
</I>&gt;<i>quad-cores, so it might be possible to upgrade it economically in 
</I>&gt;<i>the future. I don't know all of which processors might fit this 
</I>&gt;<i>machine - or the full details of Intel's Core2 range (could one find 
</I>&gt;<i>cheaper, non-Xeon quad-cores that would fit?) - but I notice (for 
</I>&gt;<i>instance) that 3 year-old Dell servers go quite reasonably on eBay, 
</I>&gt;<i>and one might find quad-cores installed in current models of those.
</I>
I don't know about this.  Are the CPU's even socketed?  Even if true, 
I suspect you'd have to find a dead Mac of the same Rev. level to 
steal parts from.  Additionally you might need &quot;matched&quot; CPU's for a 
dual CPU system.

As for using a non-Xeon CPU, not a chance, they aren't pin compatible.
