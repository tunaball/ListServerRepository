Have you been listening to anything?  We don't care that you hate  
Apple, the Air, the water, the universe, or whatever, just stop  
attacking US.  In fact, I've already said that I don't need a  
portable Mac now that I have web and e-mail in my phone, but I don't  
come here just to insult people who do need it.  On the other hand, I  
am one of the people who would be willing to spend $500 to save my  
back.  In fact, I already have spent that much in my life to baggage  
handlers so I don't have to break my back.  Does that mean that I'm  
one of the people you are calling stupid?

&gt;<i> Get over it.

Right back at you.

You people who need a minority to use as a scapegoat for all your  
problems, whether you blame the blacks, the Mexicans, the Jews, the  
bankers, the CEOs, or whomever, are a dangerous cancer on the  
planet.  Maybe you have been listening to some politician demagogue  
about two Americas and you are pissed that you are stuck in the  
crappy one so you want to blame all your problems on those of us who  
live in the great America where we can afford to spend $500 to save  
our backs.  You need to know that our success did not cause your  
failure.

Why don't you just get a job and join us in the party?  It's nice  
here.  That's a lot more fun than just being an angry little turd who  
can only make himself feel good by insulting everybody who happens to  
be successful.  You need to seek professional help to deal with your  
hatred.  In the meantime, perhaps you need to be removed from the  
list until you can come here and discuss things as an adult instead  
of being a nasty, bigoted, intolerant little piece of sh:t  who  
insults people.  All that name calling in the place of reasoning is  
unbecoming.    ;-)

OK, now let's stop this thread!
