I can tell you that I feel exactly the same way, and am in exactly  
the same position as far as buying a MacPro is concerned.

I like good-quality computers, I can't bring myself to buy a machine  
without PCI slots or enough space for a second hard-drive or extra  
RAM. I won't buy a machine with a built-in monitor on the principle  
that I already have two perfectly good monitors here. I am probably  
only just in the class of people for whom an iMac seems a little  
inadequate - I'd love an Intel Mac on my desktop and my G5 is  
starting to feel a little slow for just one or two activities, but  
the price of a MacPro is prohibitive and I can live with my G5 for  
the present.

If you order a MacPro you don't HAVE to have 2 x quad-cores. There's  
a build-to-order option that allows you to elect only a single quad- 
core processor and - here in the UK - it shaves about &#163;300 off the  
price. This brings the MacPro into the realms of affordable, about  
what I've paid for Power Macs in the past, when the cheaper options  
have been available.

&gt;<i>  OTOH, I need plenty of disk space, and more than 4Gb RAM.  
</I>&gt;<i> Basically I need a Sun Ultra 24 running Mac OS X.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/desktop/workstation/ultra24/index.xml">http://www.sun.com/desktop/workstation/ultra24/index.xml</A>
</I>
That is a very appealing price &amp; specification. I've never really  
used Sun, but it looks like they've hit a sweet spot for Unix  
workstations.

Finally: on the subject of your subject line. The apostrophe does not  
mean &quot;Holy shit! Here comes an S!&quot;, the plural of &quot;Mac&quot; is &quot;Macs&quot; and  
&quot;Mac's&quot; means &quot;belonging to the Mac&quot;, so it was unnecessary to  
apostrophise &quot;Macs&quot; in this instance.

Stroller.
