<PRE>Last night while helping a friend migrate and update her new Intel 
iMac (upgrade from a G3 portable) we ran into a problem with her 
daughter's MSN account not saving the user preferences. This was the 
original issue. After fooling around with trashing MSN preferences 
and then re-creating her specific MSN preferences we still couldn't 
get MSN to save/remember. It still delivered the original signup 
screen. Once filled in it with user and password it always logged her 
in to MSN. However, it never remembered her user and any preference 
choices. What is corrupt or needs to be rebuild for MSN to 
automatically launch the login screen? Suggestions?

In an attempt to fix this we found ourselves poking around inside 
Keychain. Since she had purchased this computer used I wasn't sure if 
it had been completely scrubbed before she took ownership and 
possibly, she was sure these certificates didn't belong to her and/or 
her family. Long story short we decided to delete the security 
certificates we found stored in Keychain. In seemed reasonable at the 
time however now, we can't even access MSN as it is looking for a 
security certificate. I figured, like a preference, the application 
would just restore a new certificate that it needs or finds lacking. 
We still have the G3 portable to pull information from if we need to 
reinstall from there. If we do need to restore these certificates, 
where would I find them and where are they accessed in the system? 
What do I need to do? Have I screwed this up? Won't be the first 
time. ha.

Thanks,
Rod
