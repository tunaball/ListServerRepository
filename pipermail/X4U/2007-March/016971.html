This is exactly the scenario proposed in the BBC article (I think I  
read it on the BBC website).

This vulnerability can mostly be taken advantage of in routers with  
no wireless encryption enabled. I think that on balance that this is  
really only a theoretical attack, or one which will only ever be  
applied to specific targets - there are fewer open APs these days  
than there were only a year or two ago (although WEP-cracking does  
increase the number of vulnerable targets), and although many of  
those that are configured in ignorance are wide-open, an attacker  
would have to war-drive in order to find them.

I think that phishing for bank details would only be viable for a  
well-organised gang in a metropolitan area (such as London), and  
probably even then there are easier ways to earn a buck. I suppose  
that transfers to an IBAN in $COUNTRY may be untraceable, but does  
your bank allow you to dispose of funds so anonymously?

Stroller.
