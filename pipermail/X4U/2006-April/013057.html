<PRE>Wow Stroller You The Man!! Fantastic information. I found out this  
afternoon from Parallels that you will need two licenses to run two  
different copies of XP in both Dual Boot Camp style and Parallels  
Workstation 2.1 style. You seem to provide a way for one copy to have  
two different license numbers here. Seems kind of crazy this is the  
case due to the fact that both copies can't be run at the same time  
on one Mac.
