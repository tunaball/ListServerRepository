<PRE>I was working on a friends Mac Mini with Tiger that was having constant
kernel panics and was asking to be shut down all the time. Disc Utility
reported a major boot block error on the disc and it couldn&#185;t fix it. So I
backed up all his data on an external FW drive and reformatted and
reinstalled the whole system but with Panther as I couldn&#185;t find the Tiger
upgrade disc I bought earlier.

Anyway system (Panther) successfully installed and data restored and then I
did something dumb I just copied his home folder (with his Library etc...)
back and overwrote his home folder and it all still seems to work except for
his wireless Apple mouse. His Apple Wireless keyboard works fine however.
You can only click with the mouse but it doesn&#185;t move. The system reports a
&#179;transport&#178; error in some file on startup which I&#185;m not sure if it&#185;s mouse
related or not. The mouse is recognized, discovered etc...in the bluetooth
control panel but still won&#185;t move the cursor when you move the mouse. Right
now he&#185;s using a USB mouse. I have a feeling things got screwed when I
copied his Tiger (with widgets etc..)home folder back to Panther. We&#185;re
going to go back to Tiger once I find the disc but in the meantime does
anybody have any ideas on how to get the wireless mouse working?

Thanx

Richard
