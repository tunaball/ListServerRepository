This is correct.

You are able to install retail editions of Windows XP on another  
machine if you (can state that) you have removed it from the machine  
which it was originally installed. If you are buying a second-hand  
copy of Windows XP then you should probably ensure that it is a  
retail edition, that the vendor has uninstalled it from his PC, that  
the CD is hologrammed and that the license number is provided on its  
original packaging.

&gt;<i> Thus you would need an un-activated copy of Windows XP.
</I>
Nope. A since copy of Windows XP may be legitimated activated many  
times, as explained above.

&gt;<i> Do many clients/users own a copy of Windows that is unused?
</I>
I am starting to see copies of Windows XP on an irregular basis that  
might be considered surplus to requirements. Nowadays I'd think that  
the people who build &amp; upgrade their own PCs, buying retail copies of  
Windows to install upon them, are very much in the minority but at  
one time this was very common practice. XP has been around 4 or 5  
years now, and some of these machines, upgraded over the best part of  
a decade, are still going... even if, eclectic collections of cheap  
hardware components that they are, they are not going strong.  
Typically PCs this age are not worth upgrading, considering the price  
of a new Dell with XP preinstalled and it prolly wouldn't be too hard  
to find a legitimate retail edition of XP for a reasonable price on  
the second-hand market.

Stroller.
