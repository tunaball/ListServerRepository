Well, I was pretty much in the mood to dream up absurd analogies  
yesterday, and I did intend to label it as such. I was to a good  
extent just being silly with this one - as you were with your &quot;stolen  
bicycle&quot; analogy. The whole point of analogies is they're absurd - an  
apple is no more like a pear or a plum than it is an orange and  
comparing apples to apples is the only really useful standpoint.

&gt;<i> There is no agreement nor license involved. The mfg could care less  
</I>&gt;<i> what you do with the bird seed and hasn't bothered to ever ask or  
</I>&gt;<i> request (vis a vis no license).
</I>
No, and if you'd read further you'd know that that was my point.  
There's no agreement nor license involved in the words &quot;Original  
Equipment Manufacturer&quot;, words which you have in the past (9 April  
2006 02:03:43 BST) used to justify a moral standpoint against end- 
user purchase of OEM Windows, a title which Ted Burton says makes it  
&quot;wrongful&quot; for an end-user to buy an OEM license.

There's a very comprehensive license that's been written up by  
Microsoft's legal department on the side of an OEM copy of Windows.  
We have established that it's legal to follow that to the letter and  
install it as an end-user (or at least you have failed to demonstrate  
otherwise) and I contend that it is no more immoral or unscrupulous  
for an end-user to buy an OEM copy of Windows than it is for them to  
plant bird seed - as long as they are following the letter of the  
license.

&gt;<i> ... You are just too inexperienced in this area to comprehend the  
</I>&gt;<i> difference.
</I>
You're right. I've never bought bird seed and I haven't planted  
sunflowers in over 20 years. But you haven't addressed any of my  
points about end-user use of OEM Windows, so that is surely not what  
you're referring to.

Stroller.
