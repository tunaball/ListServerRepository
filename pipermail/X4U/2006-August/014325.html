But not very much more.

Just because it's written in some click-through contact dreamed up by  
Microsoft's lawyers does NOT make it &quot;legal&quot;. The law is defined by  
elective representatives and interpreted in court (&quot;case law&quot;).

As we have discussed here in the past, in the UK &amp; Europe at least,  
Microsoft's OEM &quot;agreement&quot; is not worth the paper it is written on -  
it has been determined at court that sales of OEM copies of Windows  
give Microsoft a competitive advantage in the marketplace and thus  
buyers are not legally bound by this license.

Has Microsoft actually ever pursued _in court_ an individual who has  
installed an OEM copy of Windows for their own use?
Did they win?
If you were able to answer these questions then I might have some  
respect for your assertions.

As as aside, I knew the moment I saw Mr Hoffman's question that we'd  
be having this discussion. Had this group moderators I would suggest  
this as a subject for warnings or removal. I am getting quite sick of  
straying into this ground so frequently - it is decidedly off-topic  
for this group, but I will not allow incorrect assertions to go  
unchallenged.

Stroller.
