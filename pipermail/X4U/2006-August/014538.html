Umm, no. &quot;Many&quot; in this context has no useful meaning. Does the  
dealer mean &quot;many&quot; as in simply more than any other power supply, or  
&quot;many&quot; as in they increased his/her work load more than other  
products, or more likely is he or she implying that G5 power supplies  
are less reliable than others? Most likely the later was the case. If  
so consider the following. A dealer sees only 3 defective returns of  
one product over a year or so and concludes that the product must be  
quite reliable. The same dealer see 100 returns of another product in  
the same period and tells everyone that it's a piece of crap. What  
the dealer doesn't know is that only 4 of the first product were ever  
sold, as opposed to a million of the later. So the first product had  
a 75% failure rate, while the second had a .01% failure rate.

Which would you say was more reliable?
