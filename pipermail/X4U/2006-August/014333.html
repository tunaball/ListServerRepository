In the quoted above you conveniently edited my statement that:

You have still not answered the question, Mr Ameeti, and to base an  
argument for legality on the most outrageous demands dreamed up by a  
bunch of lawyers employed by a convinced monopolist doesn't sound  
very respectable either.

It is a completely irrelevant analogy to compare stealing bicycles  
with a copy of Windows that has been bought and paid for. Were one to  
be sued by Microsoft for installing an OEM copy of Windows then one  
would NOT be &quot;prosecuted&quot;; it would be a civil disagreement between  
two parties over contract terms.

I decided to look up the term &quot;shill&quot;, because I hear the word used  
so often in the context of Microsoft supporters. The description &quot;an  
accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an  
enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others&quot; would seem to  
apply far better to you than to anyone else I have ever encountered  
on the Internet.

It is quite clear that you have some personal agenda that leads you  
to fear-monger over this issue.
Please stop spouting this nonsense unless you are prepared to back it  
up with facts.

Stroller.
