As was Mr Ameeti's I thought.

I am just more direct in my statements - Mr Ameeti appears happy to  
hide by editing others responses and only replying to those of their  
statements which suit his position.

Reading old posts I find his posting of 9 April 2006 02:03:43 BST  
particularly riling - he feels it completely unnecessary to defend  
his statements, yet feels at liberty to make insults which are just  
the cowardly side of libellous (&quot;If you want to cheat, just ...  
accept the name that others would see you as.&quot;)

I will argue any point I make consistently, and I will respond to any  
counterpoint. Mr Ameeti does not have this strength of character,  
preferring to snipe with loaded words and avoid addressing any of the  
legal arguments on this subject which disputes his position. Now he  
seems prepared to allow you to argue his case for him.

&gt;<i> I have spent some time this morning looking this up on the internet  
</I>&gt;<i> (I don't have an OEM copy of Windows to see its license). It seems  
</I>&gt;<i> very clear that in the US (not in the EU) it is not legal to

</I>&gt;<i> which it shipped.
</I>
That is not what was suggested in Mr LaBore's post of 7 August 2006  
15:09:06 BST.

He suggested buying an OEM copy of Windows XP for installation on a  
new Intel Macintosh. He did NOT suggest transferring an OEM copy of  
Windows to a machine other than the one on which it shipped, because  
OEM copies of Windows XP are legally sold without a complete machine.

Transferring an OEM copy of Windows to a machine other than the one  
on which it shipped is another issue which, as you observe, appears  
to vary by jurisdiction. I do also object, therefore, to blanket  
statements that that is &quot;illegal&quot;.

There is a reasonable discussion about this at &lt;http:// 
arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20041011-4276.html&gt;. If you contend  
that buying an OEM copy of Windows (with the required small item of  
hardware) and installing on your Macintosh then please cite some  
references which demonstrate its illegality.

&gt;<i> It also appears that lots of people do it. But you DO have to agree  
</I>&gt;<i> to the license terms when you install an OS.
</I>
We'd both have to study these license terms in order to discuss  
whether they prohibit installing an OEM copy of Windows XP on a new  
Intel Macintosh, but I think you'll find they don't.

As you have already indicated by your comment &quot;not in the EU&quot;, it may  
be another matter as to whether your agreement to those license terms  
(presented, as they are, in a &quot;click-though&quot; format) is actually  
legally binding.

&gt;<i> The original poster did not ask if he could get by with doing it.  
</I>&gt;<i> And he did not ask if was a law that people agree with, and he did  
</I>&gt;<i> not ask whether the law doesn't apply in cases where you don't like  
</I>&gt;<i> the company the law benefits. The question was whether it was legal.
</I>
Indeed. And both yourself &amp; Mr Ameeti have failed to demonstrate that  
it is not legal to buy an OEM copy of Windows XP for installation on  
a new Intel Macintosh.
