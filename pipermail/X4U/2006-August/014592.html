I am sorry Phil - but I just saw this e-mail - way late...


Anyway, the best information that I got directly from the Seagate Tech
people - was that this problematic design is not in the drive itself - but
in the electronics in the external case... basically it was a deliberate
plan to extend the life of the drive - since they decided not to put a fan
inside.


&gt;<i> I'm curious as to why you think this is a problem for Macs as opposed
</I>&gt;<i> to any other computer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Some Tech person had implied that Windows XP has some sort of special disk
cache operation whereas if it is waiting for a drive like this to boot-up -
that it will store the of  information elsewhere temporarily - or something
like that - that for the end user - will prevent what I saw on the Macintosh
- which amounts to the  spinning beach ball holding up all computer
operations  while the drive boots-up...

Personally - I have no idea of what this person said was true or not ... But
that's why I brought it up.

&gt;<i> One work around would be to have cron run a shell script that simply
</I>&gt;<i> touches a file on the external drive every few minutes. The web is
</I>&gt;<i> loaded with articles on OS X and the cron facility. CronniX is a free
</I>&gt;<i> GUI wrapper for cron.  Use it to create a job like the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> */4 * * * * /usr/bin/touch /Volumes/&quot;Your HD name here&quot;/.keepAlive
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would access the disk every 4 minutes. Change the 4 to the
</I>&gt;<i> interval of your choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This  sounds like a great solution to the problem.  Personally I have never
worked with chron or shell scripts - but it sounds like a great idea ... I
will check into this - thanks.

Again - sorry for the delay in responding to this e-mail
