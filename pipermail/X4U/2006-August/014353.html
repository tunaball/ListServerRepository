Some citation or legal precedent that indicates it is not legal to  
buy an OEM copy of Windows XP for installation on a new Intel Macintosh.

If, as he insists, the small-print of the license terms prohibit  
this, then I would be grateful for a demonstration that that section  
of the license terms have been upheld in court (a court judgement  
that says the software vendor can impose any terms without  
restriction in a license agreement would be interesting, but I'm not  
convinced that it would be incontestable, should one be able to  
demonstrate that the terms are legally &quot;unreasonable&quot;).

&gt;<i> What contrary facts are you offering besides the &quot;fact&quot; that you

Ok, I have to admit, I don't particularly like Microsoft. I guess I  
just have a prejudice against white-collar felons. But that's  
irrelevant.

 From &quot;/Volumes/WXHOEM_EN/I386/EULA.TXT&quot;:

    ...This End-User
    License Agreement (&quot;EULA&quot;) is a legal agreement between you
    ... and the manufacturer (&quot;Manufacturer&quot;) of the ... computer
    system component (&quot;HARDWARE&quot;) with which you acquired the Microsoft
    software product(s) identified above (&quot;SOFTWARE&quot;).
    ...
    The term &quot;COMPUTER&quot; as used herein shall mean ... the computer
    system with which the HARDWARE operates, if the HARDWARE is a
    computer system component.

    Manufacturer grants you the following rights, provided you comply
    with all of the terms and conditions of this EULA: - Installation
    and Use. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this EULA, you
    may install, use, access, display and run only one (1) copy of the
    SOFTWARE on the COMPUTER.

I read that fairly clearly as saying &quot;if you purchased this software  
with a USB cable, stick of RAM or network card then you can run this  
software on the computer with which you use that USB cable, stick of  
RAM or network card&quot;.

We've been through all this before, last time. Please don't ask me to  
provide facts when it appears that only myself &amp; Mr Warms are  
actually prepared to offer facts &amp; citations on this subject. Those  
suggesting that it's &quot;illegal&quot; to buy an OEM copy of Windows XP for  
your Mac seem to just prefer to bad-mouth anyone doing so, without  
producing any legal documentation to back their assertions.

Frankly, I wouldn't be at all surprised if it was Microsoft's  
INTENTION that one should be able to buy a USB cable &amp; an OEM license  
for installation on your PC. Microsoft surely have enough lawyers to  
close this &quot;loophole&quot; should they wish to, and it is probably in  
their interest that one has this option - thus they discourage piracy  
and offer differential pricing to those who are not prepared to pay  
the price of the boxed retail editions of XP.

Stroller.
