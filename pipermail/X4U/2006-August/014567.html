<PRE>Hello Again.

Ronald Steinke responded to my query and answered me
below:

Ronald's reply:

&gt;<i>Periodically turn your computer off and restart it.
</I>This will allow  
&gt;<i>the directory file to be rebuilt and recognize the
</I>fact that  
&gt;<i>information has been deleted.
</I>
We do turn off the computer daily - so that's covered.
 We've had several crashes during the 4 month period
that my wife has been deleting the emails and never
did this happen.  Although once, a long time ago - we
did have this very thing happen - but was easier to
rectify.

&gt;<i>When the computer crashed without having the
</I>opportunity to 
&gt;<i>rebuild  the desktop directory, it was never told
</I>that the emails had 
&gt;<i>been deleted. 
</I>
Since the computer had done this numerous times what
do you think went wrong?

&gt;<i>go into the email program preferences and set the  
</I>&gt;<i>controls to &quot;not save messages that have been read&quot;
</I>and/or to
&gt;<i>&quot;remove message from server after -x- days&quot; . If you
</I>need to save a  
&gt;<i>particular message, create a separate emailbox with
</I>the name &quot;Saved  
&gt;<i>Emails&quot; and drag the messages you want to save into
</I>that box. 

I'll do this and we'll see what happens.  My wife has
created probably 25-30 boxes into which she sorts her
important emails.  The interesting thing is that NONE
of the messages that were placed into those boxes were
sent back to the In box - only the deleted emails
found thier way back.

&gt;<i>Hope this helps your situation.
</I>
Thank you and I hope ultimately it does help.  Only
time and the unfortunate experience of a crash will
tell ;-)

Thanks again.  Dave
