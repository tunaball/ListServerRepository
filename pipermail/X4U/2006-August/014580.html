It is possible that the preference setting to remove the messages  
from the server AFTER downloading them has not been selected and the  
messages were staying on the server and were ready to be downloaded a  
second time.

The preference settings can be confusing unless read with a computer  
language dictionary at your left hand. The text does not always  
explain things in &quot;normal&quot; english.

Another option is that her &quot;deleted&quot; messages were actually only  
being sent to the trash and had not truly been deleted, just moved  
and were waiting to be finally deleted when the trash was emptied?

Other than those options, I have never personally experienced this  
situation as described. I did have deleted messages reappear in the  
mailbox on more than one occassion, but that ended when I changed my  
preference settings to &quot;remove the messages from the server&quot; when I  
downloaded them. I never leave messages on the server any more, they  
are downloaded and dealt with immediately.  If they are trash, they  
get trashed, and if they are worth saving, they go into a separate  
mailbox according to their subject.

Hope this gives you a bigger picture and makes your life easier.
