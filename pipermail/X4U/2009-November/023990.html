<PRE> From The Mac Observer Express:

Apple: Smoking Could Void Mac Warranty
November 24th, 2009 at 8:40 AM - News by Jeff Gamet


Two smokers found out the hard way that Apple isn't interested in  
fixing Macs that have been contaminated with cigarette smoke. In both  
cases, Mac owners requested AppleCare repairs and were denied because  
of cigarette smoke contamination, according to The Consumerist.

One Mac owner took their MacBook to the Jordan Creek Apple Store in  
West Des Moines, Iowa, because his computer had been overheating.  
&quot;Apple store called and informed me that due to the computer having  
been used in a house where there was smoking, that has voided the  
warranty and they refuse to work on the machine, due to health risks  
of second hand smoke,&quot; he said.

In another case, a Mac owner took their iMac into a local authorized  
Apple repair center because it stopped working. &quot;They informed me that  
his computer can't be worked on because it's contaminated,&quot; she said.  
&quot;When I asked for an explanation, she said he's a smoker and it's  
contaminated with cigarette smoke which they consider a bio-hazard!&quot;

There's no information in either case to indicate whether the smoke  
contamination was minimal, or if the internal components were heavily  
coated with smoke and tar residue. In both cases, however, Apple  
informed the Mac owners that their computers were considered bio  
hazards and employees would not be forced to repair computers that  
could pose potential health threats.

Apple hasn't responded to requests for additional information, but it  
seems clear that damage from cigarette smoke can be enough to void  
your AppleCare warranty.
