<PRE>Hi David,

&gt;<i> Hello Everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, a weird thing just started occurring. I'm using 10.4 with Apple Mail.
</I>
Is that OS 10.4.0? Or some later dot-release?

&gt;<i> Suddenly, I started having a few emails being filtered to my Trash 
</I>&gt;<i> folder when downloading them from the ISP's server.
</I>
I aask because I have had the identical thing happen to me.
I have 10.4.9.
I use DSLExtreme.com as an ISP, so it seems it's not the ISP driving 
these routing errors. And if not the ISP, who?

&gt;<i> At first, it was one particular guy, who has sent me emails before 
</I>&gt;<i> without a problem. Suddenly, his emails were filtered to my Trash 
</I>&gt;<i> folder, without me even looking at them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then, yesterday, one email from the list, got filtered to the trash as 
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no filters set up to do this, and these emails are not marked as 
</I>&gt;<i> Junk mail.
</I>
I have had identical routing errors happen, and it's totally 
unexplainable to me.
My ISP has a WebMail area set up for it's members, which up to now I 
have never used, and it was only when I went there that I found all 
these missing messages. Like you, originally one person was shunted 
aside to the ISP's Junk folder. Now it contains messages from various 
people...
Like you, I had NOT filtered any of these folks, so what's happening?

I use Mosilla's SeaMonkey suite for my email and internet handling 
application, not Apple Mail, so that's totally different, too.

&gt;<i> Anyone have any ideas?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to forward them to someone to see if it does it on anyone elses 
</I>&gt;<i> machine as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> David
</I>
I'm totally puzzled by this David. Makes no sense to me at all.
I have nowhere logical to turn for answers, either...
Seemingly, the only similar items we both use is an Apple Macintosh 
computer, and Apple's OSX Tiger operating system.
