I'd say &quot;obviously&quot; but I suppose one could drag &amp; drop from the / 
Applications folder of the backup.

Yes, I prefer to reinstall &quot;all&quot; my applications &quot;from scratch&quot;.  
Reinstalling is not onerous on a Mac and I only ever have a handful  
of apps that I actually use - on a current system FAR more of / 
Applications/Stuff is junk that I've installed, tried &amp; never touched  
again, used for only one job &amp;c &amp;c.

I'd rather have a program b0rk out during install, find that it's not  
compatible with OS X.y and have to obtain the latest version than  
have it left over from the old install and only find out it doesn't  
work when I actually need to use it.

I would say that on a Mac a format &amp; reinstall takes a couple of  
hours to get me substantially up &amp; running again - on a PC it used to  
take me a couple of days. I love the way that I can copy over the  
preference files for the handful of applications that are really  
important to me over from my old ~/Library/Preferences to my new  
install. Windows stores such preferences in the registry and so in  
order to get them right again I would have to open each app in turn &amp;  
go through the menus ticking boxes &amp; editing settings, instead.

There are things that are definitely not right on this 18-month-old  
(??) installation of 10.4 - formatting &amp; installing would give me  
complete confidence that none of the bugs will be transferred over to  
my new system.
