Smart move.

</I>&gt;<i> to install the Optional Applications.  I believe I told it to install
</I>&gt;<i> the upgrades for everything except for iTunes.
</I>
Which option did you choose: upgrade previous version or A&amp;I?

&gt;<i> Shortly after I did that, I crashed.  Rebooted from my utility HD,
</I>&gt;<i> ran &quot;Disk Utility&quot; and &quot;DiskWarrior&quot; and everything seemed fine, so I
</I>&gt;<i> rebooted to 10.4 again, and promptly crashed.  Rebooted again, logged
</I>&gt;<i> in as root this time, started downloading the 10.4.9 combined updater
</I>&gt;<i> and a couple minutes later crashed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At that point I pulled the system disk, swapped it for the copy, and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm once again running 10.3.9.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would installing the 10.4 versions of &quot;AddressBook&quot;, &quot;iCal&quot;, iChat&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Mail&quot;, Oxford Dictionaries&quot;, &quot;Safari&quot;, or &quot;X11&quot; (like I said, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think I installed &quot;iTunes&quot;) cause instabilities on a system
</I>&gt;<i> that's been running 10.3.9 and was up-to-date with the exception of
</I>&gt;<i> the last two months worth of updates?

Shouldn't, although Tiger has more stringent RAM requirements. Most, if not all
system crashes are hardware related, with RAM being the most likely culprit.
Run the Apple Hardware Test program that came with the machine, extended tests.
If machine passes those, get MemTest and ring out the RAM.

If everything works, reclone the 10.3.9 installation and then reinstall 10.4,
using the upgrade previous version option, ensuring that you select
customization-IIRC, that should give you the optional installs. That's the
simplest and always worked best while I was beta-testing Tiger.
