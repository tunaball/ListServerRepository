Sadly I think this is the route I'm going.  I just re-upgraded, and 
crashed, pulled RAM, and crashed.  I also realized a few months ago I 
had done a clean install of 10.4 onto a bare disk to troubleshoot a 
video problem, and had no problems.  At least I have a spare HD or 
two I can use for testing this some more even with having two copies 
of my 10.3.9 system drive.

I'll be kicking off another clone of the System Disk tonight, and if 
I can find the time I'll start digging out all of my install disks. 
Back when I moved from my 8500/180 to my G4/450 I used to have a 
spreadsheet that showed the current state of the software I was using 
(my S/N's, what versions I was running, and what's current).  I kept 
that going till I started running the G5, and sadly stopped updating 
it.  I think I'm going to have to go through and inventory what I 
have and what I need.  Some things such as FCE and DVD Studio Pro 2.0 
won't get installed, as iMovie and iDVD now do everything I need.

I do know one thing, you must have significantly fewer apps than I do 
if you can reinstall in just a couple of hours!

BTW, what does it take to install classic on 10.4?  I didn't notice 
anything about that in the 10.4 upgrade.
