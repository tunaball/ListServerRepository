No, you wouldn't be able to. I'm pretty sure this is because the CCC  
&amp; SuperDuper are front-end for the `ditto` command - they're probably  
protecting you from trying to blindly copy resource-forks across the  
network.

Hmmmn... how are you mounting the NAS?
Have you tried using Apple-K in Finder and then <A HREF="afp://NAS.name">afp://NAS.name</A> as  
well as <A HREF="smb://NAS.name">smb://NAS.name</A> ?

What filesystem is the LaCie drive formatted with?

I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that Samba has long filename  
issues, but would be surprised if it couldn't handle files from a  
FAT32-formatted drive. Apple's HFS, on the other hand, and the way  
that Finder allows you to put punctuation in filenames, seems be very  
flexible (far more than many other filesystems or network file- 
sharing protocols, I'd imagine).

I don't think you'll find this easy to overcome. I'm sure that just  
making a tar or zip archive of the files on the LaCie drive would be  
unsatisfactory, although you might find that you can copy a .dmg disk  
image of it onto the NAS which can be mounted acceptably.

You might try copying via the command-line and redirecting stderr to  
a text file (you might have to use the find command to cp each file  
individually, piping through tar twice to preserve directory  
structure), so that afterwards you can examine in that which  
filenames have failed. If it's only a handful then you might be able  
to simply rename them.

I'd have most confidence in taking the XFS disk out of the NAS unit  
and connecting it &amp; the LaCie to a Linux box. If this is successful  
then the drive can be placed back in the NAS &amp; you _should_ be able  
to access the files ok, but if there are significant numbers of files  
that can't be copied that way then you're h0sed.

Stroller.
