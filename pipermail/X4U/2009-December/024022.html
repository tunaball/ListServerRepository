I am wanting a true &quot;smart phone&quot; and would like to do more eMail and text messaging in a mobile format. The RAZR2 is one of the most disappointing phones I've ever owned. Any phone I get, I would really like to be able to tether my MacBook Pro with. I was able to do it with the RAZR2 over bluetooth, no thanks to Motorola. I had to Google a home grown solution from others on the Internet.

Nick,

What model is your BB Curve? I am planning on moving to the Curve 8530 from my current RAZR2 in the next couple of days. I'm curious what drivers/modem scripts would be required to get it to tether to my MacBook Pro running 10.6.2. When I say tether, I'm wanting to use it as a broadband modem. Whether it works over bluetooth or USB, that's OK, as long as it works. The model of BB I'm looking at uses a trackpad instead of a trackball.

Joe
