That's correct. You can also choose to leave mail on the server for a specified time.

POP3 servers don't delete anything until a session is closed. Your client tells the server to delete messages as they are read or when Eudora is connected and its list of old messages contain some that are ready to be removed.

As you log off the server remembers which are set for deletion and makes a single pass through the mailbox that removes listed items and rewrites others.

An important thing to understand is that messages all contain a unique header, Message-id:, that is created as the message is sent so there can be no problems identifying messages that need to be deleted.

An, while I'm at it.

The lady of the house has Gmail periodically recover her mail from our personal server using POP3, filter it for spam, and then reads it out from Google's server using Apple's mail.app. It makes me sick.
