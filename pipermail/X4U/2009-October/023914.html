Mark:

I too have a this issue. My sense is it is a finder issue. As the  
finder from time to time takes forever to just highlight 1 or 2 or so  
members in a folder. What may be *MY* issue is that some folders  
contain 15K of files. I have had issues with small folders as well.  
Just trying to highlight 2 items can take 30+ seconds in a folder of  
less than 1000 entries.

Even though I have my volumes indexed the finder can takes minutes to  
find items. Example: Today I got a call from my doctor and he wanted  
to phone in a prescription for me. My pharmacy's telephone number is  
in a document that I keep to hand to doctors to show what  
prescriptions I am on. I did a search and after about 30 seconds I  
put down the phone and went out to the last bottle I had gotten and  
read it off to her ( got it and read it off and the finder still  
hadn't found the document and I was searching on the name of the  
document not the contents.

The finder (to me) has become a slow moving turtle and at some point  
in the future it will stop working. Before anyone says... I have 50G  
available on the boot volume and 100G on my other volume . They are  
checked weekly bu tech tool pro and I have never had an error called  
out.
