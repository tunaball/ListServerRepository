	I have not been successful using the build-in mic on my powerbook.   
Noise from the computer causes too much interference.

	Seems odd to me that Apple would skimp on this.  Macs are supposed  
to be the do-it-all machine, but can't even record sound without a  
pre-amp.  This needs more thinking on Apple's part.
