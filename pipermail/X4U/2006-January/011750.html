<PRE>Jim:

Definitely try unplugging the machine from power, leave it unplugged for a
while (overnight), and then plug it back in and try again.

As stupid as this sounds, some people who, after installing 10.4.4, had
their fans revving at top speed all the time found that this solution worked
when resetting PRAM, OF, etc. did not.

One other item you might want to try is getting some high quality contact
cleaner for your RAM connections. I've heard through others that this solved
problems that were otherwise unsolvable.

Good luck! We're all pulling for you (and the Mac).

... Eric
