<PRE>I don't have one, but I've heard that they are kind of a pain to use,  
and that, at least in earlier models, the iPods were actually  
scratched by the case.  I can see the potential benefits, if you are  
doing some pretty intense activity with your iPod.

I used silicone cases and some other options for the first six months  
or so that I had my iPod, eventually I get sick of them.  Honestly,  
the bulkier cases make it harder to use the iPod.  The silicone cases  
are near impossible to get in and out of pockets...they are &quot;sticky&quot;.

I wound up getting plastic skin (<A HREF="http://www.podskinz.com">http://www.podskinz.com</A>) and a foof  
(<A HREF="http://www.foofpod.com">http://www.foofpod.com</A>).  I am particularly fond of the foof, they  
are handmade in Australia and work great!  I've wond up buying them  
for both of our ipods, both iBooks, and a few as gifts as well.

For me, the podskinz/foof combo offered usability while providing an  
acceptable level of protection.  Of course, if I drop it, I may still  
be out of luck, as mentioned in my prior post regarding the cold  
weather issue.  But, the iPod was in a silicone case at the time and  
he still had issues that, luckily, were easily resolved.  I also no  
longer use my iPod at the gym and the such - I use a shuffle instead  
- but that is just me.  I do travel pretty heavily with it and so far  
everything has been fine.

Best piece of mind...Applecare, which of course is still not complete  
protection.

Just my 2&#162;, everyone has different levels of acceptable protection.

Hope that helps!

Samantha
