<PRE>Hi:

You may have already tried all these things but if you haven't it may be
worth a shot.

Have you reset the pram? (boot holding down Apple Option P R until it chimes
three or four times and then let it start normally)

Definitely boot into open firmware (boot holding down Apple Option O F) and
type the following with a return after each line:

reset-nvram
set-defaults
reset-all

after the last return the machine will reboot.

Also, try simply unplugging the machine from all electrical power for an
hour and then plug it back in and try again.

Finally, not sure if this machine has it, but on some of these machines
there is a reset switch on the motherboard. It's a tiny little switch
somewhere on the motherboard. If it were me, I would search that out to see
if there is one and if there is, press it (I believe you should unplug the
machine before doing so). I've had machines that wouldn't boot at all and
simply pressing this button completely resolved the problem.

Finally, unconnect and reconnect connectors inside the machine. May simply
be a bad connection between some components.

You may have a bad motherboard... in which case this is all for naught...
but then again, you might not!

Good luck.
