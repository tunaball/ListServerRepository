   <TITLE> [X4U] I have recently upgraded my G4 MDD, 1.26GHz, 1.25GB,
	Radion Pro
	9600 from 10.3.9 to 10.4.3. . Method of upgrade was to backup my
	Internal
	HD to an external fw drive. Ran disk repair on ext, Upgraded (plain
	upgrade) the external drive. booted into it,
	everything seemed to be fine.
	I then cloned my Internal hd from the external. Using Super Duper. My
	internal drive was also fine. (I did not erase the internal drive
	first) I then ran DW which showed some directory fragmentation,
	used DW to repair, 
	then ran latest updates. Prior to upgrading and also after upgrading,
	when
	using Firefox (v 1.5) I often see a blue Q with question mark in
	various window panels. After Upgrading when using Safari to load
	http://www.nfl.com,
	Safari loads the page and immediately crashes with the
