<PRE>It's hard to say if you need the new features--time will tell. In my 
mind, the new or improved technologies are worth the price. The new 
Core Image framework is supposed to significantly improve graphics 
processing. The H.264 codec is a big step forward. And, letting the OS 
take advantage of 64-bit processors is essential. I do a lot of file 
searching, so I look forward to Spotlight. It's a long way from 
Sherlock 2 if for no other reason than it being available to 
applications, not just the Finder.

 From a user's point of view, Dashboard widgets probably aren't that 
much different from 3rd party Desk Accessories in System 6 and prior, 
but the underlying technology has more in common with AppleScript. As I 
understand it, widgets are mostly interfaces that call on existing 
system frameworks, functions, commands, etc.
