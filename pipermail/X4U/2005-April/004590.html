No.

And only computers purchased after the announcement (Apr 12) are 
eligible for a free copy of Tiger. ($10 fee for the media)

It only comes on DVD, but you can send back your DVD disks and they 
will send you the CDs.

I was more interested in talking about the features. Is the upgrade 
worth it? Do we really need those new features? Probably not, but I'm a 
mac addict and I can't help myself. I never use Expos&#233; or FileVault, 
for example. But I'm really looking forward to Spotlight and Dashboard. 
I wonder if Apple isn't just constantly reinventing the wheel. What 
happened to Sherlock? Wasn't that supposed to be the answer to file 
searching and to grabbing useful web content and presenting it in a 
more attractive centralized place? But indexing was slow and always in 
the way. And I ended up finding it more attractive to go directly to 
web sites to get that content. Will dashboard be a better solution?

I still miss having a location switcher that will change things like 
smtp address and default printer when I move my laptop from home to 
work. I use Location X, but there are problems. You'd think Apple would 
put this feature back in. Maybe I can make a macro using Automater.
