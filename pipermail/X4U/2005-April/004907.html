<PRE>Hi all,

I received my first iPod yesterday. It's an iPod Shuffle and I'm 
looking forward to lots of use from it. I have a few questions. I had 
it delivered here at work and promptly installed what needed to be 
installed the plugged it in and let iTunes fill it up. Everything 
worded great. Last night while listening I noticed that a few tutorials 
for various things as well as a few chapters from audio books were 
added as well. I decided to plug it in at home and maybe remove the 
tracks I didn't want and replace them from my home music library. When 
I plugged the iPod in a message came up saying it's playlist was linked 
to another computer and did I want to completely replace it. If I click 
NO, the iPod doesn't show up in iTunes. If I click YES it shows up but 
only with the option to erase and AutoFill it. Is there any way I can 
use it at both locations? I have completely different music libraries 
at home and at work and I'd like to have music from both on the iPod. 
I'd also like to use the iPod to transfer music from work to home and 
vice versa. Is this possible?

OS 10.3.9  iTunes 4.7.1

Thanks
