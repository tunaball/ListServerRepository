I have two different G4/450's  that have been in use since before OSX 
initial release.
They both have had each version of OSX installed on top of one another 
right after each new release, and all upgrades in-between.
I can honestly say I've never &quot;seen&quot; any problems due to any of the OS 
upgrades.   each of these G4/450 are used for entirely two different 
things. one used at work, the other at home where I use Photoshop, 
GarageBand, iPhoto often.

Pre OSX days, I used to be hesitant about upgrades, and doing the 
waiting game to see what happens.  I suppose I could count it all up to 
luck who knows.
But I will install Tiger as soon as my copy arrives.

I do however realize that on the other hand, there have been those who 
have had problems with different upgrades.  So I know my luck has not 
been universal.  I for one did not see any problems with Java after 
this last upgrade.
