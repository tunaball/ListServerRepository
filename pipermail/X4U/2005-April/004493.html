I have a Belkin UPS.   I've had it for a few years now, and it has been 
as reliable as a rock. 

I exclusively used APC UPS's for many years, but when I purchased my last 
APC UPS I soon realized that APC now leaves off AVR (automatic voltage 
regulation) on what I would call their consumer-class models ($100 or 
less).  In fact, while using that last APC UPS that I purchased, every 
time that I turned on my laser printer (which was not attached to the 
UPS) there was a sag in the power that caused my Macintosh to shut down 
despite being attached to the APC UPS!  I returned the APC and got a 
Belkin.  The Belkin was cheaper, with better specs and features, and it 
includes AVR, which I consider to be something that a UPS should not be 
without. 

Here is the 800VA Belkin UPS for only $88:

3683&gt;

If you need unattended shutdown software, Belkin has that available for 
free for OS X, including Panther, for use with their UPS's.
