Well a couple of people have asked so I thought I'd respond.

The impacts of upgrades to the server software are varied depending 
on how many of its products you use.

If all you use is file services then all the patches are fine. Indeed 
they have improved several facets of the software.

However if you are using mail, web, print, use a lot of fonts and a 
few other services then there is a good chance that at least one of 
the upgrades has &quot;broken&quot; one of those services. The biggest issue at 
the moment seems to be the most recent security patch with many 
people (but not all) have had issues with in regard to mail.

The best idea is to look at the Apple Discussion forums and the 
various server lists to see if someone with a similar configuration 
to you (almost every server is configured differently) has had a 
problem.

If it seems OK (and you have the resources) install the upgrade on a 
test server and test comprehensively. If you don't have the 
resources, warn your users of possible disruption, make a full 
backup, install the upgrades and see what happens.

Be prepared to implement your &quot;roll back&quot; plan though.

&quot;Most&quot; people (this is not a guarantee though) find the upgrade 
through to 10.3.8 (apart from the last security patch) is OK. But 
your kilometreage(?) might vary.

Lot of people are hoping 10.3.9 will come out before 10.4 so they 
don't have to upgrade to fix these issues (and perhaps swap them for 
new ones).
