<PRE>Yeah, I remember that post. It's even funnier now than it was back then. I
don't think Ishan will be able to cancel those orders after two years' time.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Think about it logically, after seeing today's introductions of new

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cooling and multiple fans which far exceed the need for cooling the 970fx x
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2 chips installed. Other features, including the lack of a high-end video
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> card, approriate PCI slots, a small single &quot;slow&quot; HD (for professional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> videographers and the like) all indicate that this 2.5 Ghz  Powermac was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designed to accommodate another chip, i.e., the 975.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At WWDC, Jobs will introduce a 3.2 GHz dual PowerMac using the 975 chip
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is being produced with reasonable yields at IBM's Fishkill plant. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model will have a $1000 price premium for educational pricing alone and will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be actually available, i.e., delivered to customers after September 1. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addition, Jobs will indicate that a quad processor variant (with an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> astronomically high price tag) is under development and will be available
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within a year. The 975   chip in limited amounts has scaled up to 4+ Ghz
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> although reliability/endurance testing is not complete as of today.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In summary, today's release was scheduled for January, but due to fab
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems, an insufficient supply of 2.5 Ghz chips was available and even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now, it somewhat constrained. The mistakes make in the design of this chip
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were rectified early on in the design of the 975 chip-the development of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these two chips were in parallel but not entirely synchronous.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The current 2.5 GHz dual unit is a good value, but Apple is not investing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much in advertising or offering &quot;the best&quot; in hardware (hard drives, video
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cards, memory, etc), all of which is reserved for the 975 dual 3.2 GHz unit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In preliminary testing, this unit using all of the various Photoshop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filters/actions (not just the select few which favor  the 970 series vs. the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P4) performs at least twice as fast as the highest-end units available from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large vendors.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have several 2.0 Ghz units and have ordered several 2.5 Ghz machines (but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I get a huge discount :). However, I will cancel these orders when the WWDC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> announcement is made and get the 3.2 dual Ghz machines. I think the quad
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machines are going to be beyond my budget i.e., will exceed $7000 for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> base machines for education store customers.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just a FYI from a devoted reader. Please do not share my email address, name
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or anything else if you publish any of this. You may quote me in part or in
