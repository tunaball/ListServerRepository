One area I agree on with Thurrot (and many others) is I hate essentially
being forced to use the Dock as my application launcher,or at the very
least have it occupy the bottom of my screen or pop up when ever I muse
to the bottom :-(

I wish the Dock were an optional program. It's a pretty useless launcher
because it easily gets overfull and far too tiny on small screens (try
using it on original 15&quot; iMacs or 12&quot; iBooks) and folders all look alike
(gah! WTF were they thinking?).

I _do_ use it for my most commonly run programs (it might as well serve
_some_ use to me since, like siamese twins - there's no pretty method of
separation I'm aware of), but never for document or folders. If I had
the choice I'd use a program I could bring to the foreground at a
keystroke, or the good old Apple Menu (I'm still not sure what Apple
thought was so bad about it - sure, it was an old idea, but old doesn't
always mean outdated or bad).

One unfortunate downside of OSX has been the removal of choice in UI
customisation. Apple needs to do better. Fine - provide a newbie
friendly way of working, but allow intermediate and power users some
options as well.

 Jamie Kahn Genet
