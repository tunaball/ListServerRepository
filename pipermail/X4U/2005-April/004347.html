<PRE>Jim,

I don't have an answer for you in regards to Tiger but I know what you 
mean about dealing with the Apple Canada Store. Or more specifically 
their shipping method. I ordered an iMac last August and never received 
it. I was able to track the shipment to Same Day Right Away and then it 
just disappeared. To make matters worse, this was at the time that 
Apple discontinued making the &quot;monitor on a stick&quot; iMacs and had 
completely sold out of their stock. It took them three months to find a 
  replacement machine. I tried to convince them to ship me a newer iMac 
G5 but they wouldn't go for it.
