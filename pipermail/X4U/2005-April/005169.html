<PRE>A few corrections:

That is not possible. Disk Copy (rolled into Disk Utility since Mac OS 
X v10.3) could do so, but only until Mac OS X v10.2. Apple has removed 
this possibility, presumably to oblige the music industry. But even 
when Disk Copy had this feature, it wasn't the &quot;closest way&quot;.

This applies to data or various &quot;enhanced&quot; formats (quite a different 
issue). The Red Book does not allow multi-session audio CDs.

Actually, CDDB (or freedb for that matter) uses a &quot;magic number&quot; which 
takes into account several items from the TOC. The magic number of a 
playlist burned to CD will definitely be different from that of the 
original CD; but it may be close enough for a fuzzy logic-based search 
algorithm to find it, and that's what the current version of CDDB uses.

</I>
Gracenote is somewhat optimistic. The &quot;magic number&quot; depends on the 
number of tracks -- the higher, the more accurate. Which means the 
system works nicely for the average pop record, which has around 10 
tracks; but if you're a fan of Hindustani classical music, like I am, 
you have to get accustomed to getting misses quite often, because it's 
common for those CDs to contain only one or two tracks.

There are no CDDB &quot;identifiers&quot; attached to individual tracks read from 
an audio CD (even one containing CD-Text). However, if you make an 
iTunes playlist of AIFF files and add tag info (performer, title, 
album, etc.), iTunes will write the tag in the AIFF file.
