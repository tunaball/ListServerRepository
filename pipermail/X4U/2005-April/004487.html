what can be more important than reminding a computer user that 
backups are crucial? it's about best practices. the choice of tools 
depends so much on the environment, users, network/hardware/apps, 
that it wouldn't be appropriate to toss a loose suggestion at the 
original poster.

if the poster comes back with &quot;so what do you suggest&quot; (which is 
usually the case), then they'll get a reply. otherwise, posting 
suggestions upon suggestions based on googled info isn't really 
helpful to the original poster either (although one or two people 
obviously spend a lot of time googling for answers to posts and 
advertising their osx books). ;)

&gt;<i>Since you didn't even give an URL for the program you suggested, I
</I>&gt;<i>assume you meant <A HREF="http://www.tolisgroup.com">http://www.tolisgroup.com</A> (where I was able to
</I>&gt;<i>determine that the program is a commercial one, but was not able to
</I>&gt;<i>find something like, say, a price-list).
</I>
who suggested bru to the original poster? i recommend it to my 
clients based on known abilities, environments, variables, etc.

&gt;<i>Since you asked, I'd suggest rsyncx which is free and open source.  It
</I>&gt;<i>has a GUI and command-line version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You can find out more about it here
</I>&gt;<i>	<A HREF="http://archive.macosxlabs.org/rsyncx/rsyncx.html">http://archive.macosxlabs.org/rsyncx/rsyncx.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>and download it from here
</I>&gt;<i>	<A HREF="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/16814">http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/16814</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>TjL
</I>
...just be aware rsyncx overwrites some of osx's built in unix tools. 
i wouldn't suggest going there if you don't want breakage and/or 
incompatibility issues later.
