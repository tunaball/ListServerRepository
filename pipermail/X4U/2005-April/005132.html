As an addendum to this problem, I have found that the power supply fan 
does not work either. I removed it from the P/S and checked it with 
another power source and it works fine putting another new fan in the 
P/S makes no difference. It does not work either. I have temporarily 
connected it with a jumper to a drive connector so that the P/S will 
not over heat. Also the CD

I  put a Gigabit Ethernet Apple PCI card in it and it works fine. I am 
able to network and use Roadrunner cable internet. It runs Safari very 
fast. Still no onboard Ethernet or USB. So, it seems that the PCI slots 
are all functional as is most of the processing functions.

Oddly enough, the CD Drive has stopped reading CD's and the hard drive 
( Maxtor Diamond max 9 series 120 GB 2002) that had the 9.1 on it , 
that I used to install the firmware, suddenly started clicking and now 
is non-operational. Possibly this is a clue to how the update went sour 
if it was unknowingly beginning to fail prior to the update. However, 
all hardware seemed in perfect running order prior to the update and 
had shown no visible errors.

My dilemma is still ..............  How do I get the firmware 
straightened out when it says    &quot;Firmware is already at 4.2.8 &quot; ?
