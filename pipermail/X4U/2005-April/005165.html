<PRE>Something weird is happening with Mail.app and I'm not sure where to 
look for answers.

Yesterday morning I sent an email to a group of friends. In the 
afternoon I sent an email to a client and she was suppose to reply to 
it within five minutes. (lots of emails coming and going in between) 
After about 20 minutes I caller her to say I hadn't received her email 
approval yet. She claimed to have sent it but that she would do so 
again. While I'm waiting I notice that my buddy has replied to the 
message I sent that morning (he actually did a reply all to everyone I 
had sent mine to). While reading his message I scrolled down and 
discovered my client's reply was part of the message from my buddy. 
Basically there was my buddy's message with his signature at the bottom 
then immediately below there was long headers followed by my clients 
reply. The long headers are from the message from my client and appear 
to be ok. Both my buddy and client use different ISPs. Any ideas how 
this could happen? I did receive the reply my client re-sent.

This has happened to me twice but only since I've upgraded to 10.3.9, 
the first time was with two different people. At the time I just wrote 
it off as a fluke but after this second time I'm not so sure.
