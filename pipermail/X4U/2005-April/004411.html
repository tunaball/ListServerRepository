Deborah,

Well if you must have SCSI and you have the cash, then I think best 
option would be a Mini and a KVM.

That way your old machine could still run OS 9 and SCSI would be 
happy and the Mini would run 10.3 (or even 10.4 if you can wait a few 
days / weeks). Either way 10.3 or 10.4 are much better than the 10.2 
(Jaguar) that you currently have.

You could move everything onto the Mini (except the applications that 
use the SCSI devices - are these scanners or just external drives?).

If your network switch or hub has enough capacity you could have both 
machines on the network where they could share your new printer and 
use file sharing to move files between the two as required.
