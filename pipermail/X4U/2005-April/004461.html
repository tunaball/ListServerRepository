<PRE>Hello:
	I would further add that I would like to hear Apple's position on this 
issue, and not just a transient comment like &quot;Apple does not feel this 
is an issue&quot;.

	Consider this.  A few months ago, someone announced a security bug in 
every IDN-enabled web browser (Opera, Mozilla, FireFox, among others), 
and claimed that of all developers contacted, Opera Software brushed it 
off as &quot;its not our problem&quot;, while the Mozilla Foundation was quickly 
working on a fix.  As it turned out, the IDN &quot;issue&quot; was known by the 
designers of the International Domain Name system, and in fact, was part 
of its implementation; and the Mozilla Foundation was ridiculed for its 
over-eagerness in implementing a &quot;fix&quot; in haste that actually crippled 
the IDN implementation of the browser.  When Opera's position was 
publicized, it turned out that they had explained, correctly, that the 
&quot;issue&quot; was part of the IDN design, and that their implementation 
followed it as intended; and that the Opera browser, being used in other 
countries other than the USA (many with non-roman characters), worked 
properly and no &quot;fix&quot; was needed.

	I mention this as an example of how security issues can be over-stated, 
and how developer's reactions can be miscommunicated and downplayed.

	dZ.
