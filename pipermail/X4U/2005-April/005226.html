LOL  I'm the one who started this mess.  And although I did ask about 
making a copy of an original audio CD,  I don't necessarily want to 
DUPLICATE the CD, as much as I want an exact copy of the MUSIC.   And 
it would appear that importing as AIFF gives me just that.

Ordinarily, 99 times out of a 100, if I buy a new audio CD, I rip it to 
MP3s and put away the audio CD.  I have my sound system in my home and 
my car set up so that I can listen to mp3s.    But I recently purchased 
a new AUDIO CD and I wanted to burn a copy of it in full quality into 
an AUDIO CD format to take in my car.     I just wanted to give this 
particular CD a few good listens without it being an mp3.

I got another question for you all.   My stereo in my car has a CD 
player AND an auxiliary jack on the front.  The CD player can play Data 
CDs loaded up with mp3s if I like..     I've noticed that my iPOD 
hooked up to the auxiliary jack and played that way, seems to sound 
better.. than if I play a DATA CD loaded with mp3s..   is this possible 
?

I'm guessing that if I'm using a DATA CD.. it's up to the CD Player to 
decode the mp3s etc..  as opposed to the iPod decoding the mp3s..  
could the iPod be better at that ???
