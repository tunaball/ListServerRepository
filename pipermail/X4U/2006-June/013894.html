Actually, Eugene, to whom you're responding doesn't have to worry. He's
advocating a crusade, not a jihad, so he'll be just fine with our handlers.

I recently gave a deposition in support of a colleague. The adversary
attorney asked me about a standard telephone conversation that people in my
profession use to pass responsibility from one to another at the beginning
of the weekend, and in a voice ringing with authority intoned &quot;so, NO ONE
knows the content of this conversation?&quot; I replied &quot;no -- oh, wait,
actually, that's probably not true, but I doubt the NSA will release the
transcript to you...&quot;

By the way, I don't think there's an &quot;Office of Homeland Defense.&quot; It's the
&quot;Department of Homeland Security.&quot; And it's already underfunded. And I
cannot find my SSN on any recent boarding passes, reservation locator
records, or the few paper airline tickets I've been issued recently. Perhaps
you're upset because the last time you tried to purchase an airline ticket
with nickels scrubbed in an ultrasonic cleaner to remove any traces of
fingerprints the sales agent attempting to mimic an Irish accent from her
office in New Delhi objected that she didn't know how you could send her the
nickels over the phone...
