I disagree with Mr Healy, but not completely.

As I said before, I have 512meg in my MacBook and it is quite usable  
as my secondary machine.

My mother has had only the stock 256meg in her Powerbook 12&quot; since  
she bought it new 12 months ago - that seems to be suffering more  
spinning beachballs in the last 6 months (perhaps because of Tiger or  
the current iPhoto?) but is still usable by a pensioner and I found  
it quite usable, too, until recently.

But I agree with Zane in that I do think it's somewhat misleading of  
Apple to have more RAM in their display models than their basic  
configuration.  I suppose this is a compromise - if the base model  
carries 512meg then show-room demonstrators with 1gig is better than  
ones with 2gig!! But the showroom models will mostly only be played  
with one application at a time - &quot;ooh, isn't the keyboard nice? look  
how fast iPhoto is!&quot; - whereas the customer is more likely to have  
several apps running when he gets home after buying a machine with  
only half as much RAM!

&gt;<i> I'm going after the second 1GB board and the faster drive next.
</I>
I'll probably buy more RAM sooner, but for a hard-drive I'm hoping to  
hold out for those hybrid drives promised next year which will be  
fitted with onboard flash memory - this will be used as cache, and  
will ensure especially that paging to swap is faster and consumes  
less battery. Really, I hope it'll be nearly like having that much  
extra RAM in your machine.

Seagate &amp; Hitachi both have models planned - Seagate's first model is  
to have 250meg of flash, but the way flash-prices are falling it  
should be economical for manufacturers to fit 2gig. The question is,  
of course, how much of a premium they'll charge consumers for this -  
the technology that is built into the drive, caching intelligently  
and making the flash invisible to the o/s is surely the clever-part.  
Will early adopters pay for it?
