Sorry, but I simply do not agree with this portion of your post.

I have the gut feeling that the majority of consumers can be likened  
to sheep in that they will buy what the producers make available and  
not look for any improvement or customization of features unless they  
are convincingly confronted with a proof of benefit to do so. Many  
times, even proving a benefit will not convince the consumer public  
that their rights are being violated by the producer companies or  
that they (the consumers) should boycott the products in question.

Look at MicroSoft products for a prime example. One feature that MS  
has added to some programs is called an &quot;authentication code&quot; which  
has to be verified by MS before newly installed software will be  
activated on your computer. You can no longer simply install the  
program and then run it. You will have to visit the MS web site to  
have your paid for and installed properly software activated first.  
All my PC acquaintances seem to be perfectly willing to conform to  
this act of coercion and continue to buy MS software, although I  
cannot understand why.

As long as the buying public will accept conditions and restrictions  
and continue to buy the products, the producers will continue to  
force their desires and conditions on all of us. Then, it becomes a  
requirement for those who do not like those actions to rebel against  
the conditions by peaceful and lawful means.

As long as the law does not specifically prohibit an action, it can  
be argued that the action is legal even if morally or ethically  
wrong. Big businesses use this as an excuse all the time, some  
politicians do too. Shouldn't we have the right to use the same type  
of tactics?

If the law specifically prohibits an action that we consider it to be  
immoral or unethical in its enforcement, then we should have the  
right to work to repeal that law.
