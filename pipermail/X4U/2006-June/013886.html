Randy has done this before, vehemently arguing that:
   &quot;to use every bit of available memory, ... is the sign of a well  
written application.&quot;
        (10 September 2004 19:25:45 BST)
and eventually later retracting this statement whilst still  
maintaining what an asshole I am.

Until I came to review his posts (if your list archive goes back that  
far do a Spotlight for &quot;From: randy&quot; and &quot;entire message contains:  
memory&quot;, otherwise look at the list's archive on the web) I had  
forgotten _quite_ how obnoxious &amp; rude he was. I felt that in the  
original instance I pointed out his mistake quite gently, and he  
would have been able to retract it without embarassment but he  
rapidly became quite insulting.

Even when corrected by other knowledgeable users he refused to  
apologise and said that &quot;that wasn't what I originally meant&quot;, even  
though he had reinforced &amp; clarified that position with a second  
posting.

Randy appears to me to be knowledgeable on many practical aspects of  
using a Mac, and because of the way he promotes this and his  
authorship of a best-selling Mac book some years ago, causes me to  
wonder if your statement &quot;most on this list already know it&quot; is true.  
Nevertheless he is back to his old tricks, and he seems to have  
revealed his character quite tellingly following your posting.

Stroller.
