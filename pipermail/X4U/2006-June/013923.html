quoting a source in private communication does not in any way infringe 
on copyright. Email is private communication. It is a simple as that. 
It is a manner of good manners to name the source and to quote 
correctly, using proper punctation to show where something has been 
deleted or is only being paraphrased. It is not necessary to name the 
source with all the data including ISBN. 

And the law is also perfectly clear, that a writer is responsible for 
what he writes, just as I am at the moment for what I am writing here.

When quoting from a published source, it is only necessary to be exact 
and to give the complete source. The author has no legal grounds to 
object, since by publishing, he has gone public.  The quote you use, 
taken from your publication or communication cannot be used for or 
against the original author. It can be if taken from his original 
publication, but that cannot be any concern of yours.

It is a different matter entirely when quoting from private 
communication or from a lecture for instance. There, written permission 
from the author is absolutely necessary. Good manners should seem 
obvious...

get the feet back on the ground.
