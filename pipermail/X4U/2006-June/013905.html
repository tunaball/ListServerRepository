	It is not nuts.  It make perfect sense.  Think about it instead of  
react to it.

	The law is perfectly clear: a writer owns what they write.  They  
have--or should have--control over what happens to their words.  This  
is important.  I have run across several instances where violation of  
this right has caused problems.

	In one instance a person mentioned some personal information on a  
list.  Someone else quoted that message to another list without the  
writer's permission.  A person on the second list turned out to be  
someone not to be trusted.  They stalked the original author, causing  
problems and danger.

	I used quotes from a mailing list in a book.  I asked permission  
each time.  Twice I was turned down for reasons that I had never  
considered.  One person said he did not want the quote used because  
it could be misinterpreted by professional colleagues when taken out  
of context.

	There are numerous other examples.   The whole matter hinges on one  
concept: politeness.  Be polite and ask for permission to quote.   
When you don't you're breaking the law and possibly causing someone  
harm or inconvenience.  Because you believe you have wide enough  
experience to consider all the ramifications doesn't mean you do.   
Ask first be for using other people's words.
