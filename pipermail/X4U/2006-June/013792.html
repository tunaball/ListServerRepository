It is. Because you can cut and paste with stroke of key. And edit it and lay
it out with software and repackage it to make it look perfect. With paper
you have to really physically cut and paste with glue and photocopy. And
people have done that and people everywhere still are. I've seen numerous
numerous pieces of collage art made this way and in the pre desktop
publishing time I saw lots of cranks making their own wacky publications
this way. Nobody's gone after them because the product looked like a
collage. It's raw material copyright or not. Stop them. It's analogous to
digital vs. analog re-recording.

</I>&gt;<i> I make the decision where to place my words. No one has the right to re-post

</I>
I respect them. I respect you. But just because you hit the &quot;I AGREE&quot; button
doesn't change anything. People are still going to do it and what are the
consequences? Mostly none. If, if they get caught and if someone complains
the worst that can happen is they get kicked off the list. They can go to
another in seconds flat. And then the deed is done. People will do it and
there's nothing you or anyone can do to stop them. You only make the
decision to post on the internet after that it's up for grabs. Say it's
ain't so.
