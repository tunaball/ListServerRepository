&gt;<i> as to this piece of advice&#133; what is there to say? it's just pure  
</I>&gt;<i> arrogance. have you ever heard of the concept of &quot;english as a  
</I>&gt;<i> foreign language&quot; where spelling mistakes are NOT due to laziness or  
</I>&gt;<i> lack of instruction (at least not in the sense in which you mean it&#133;)?
</I>
Yes, I am most definitely familiar with the concept of &quot;English as a foreign language&quot;, as I am not a native English speaker; Spanish being my primary language.  Some of us take great pride in learning such a purely human and fascinating endeavor as written communication, in whatever language it is.  Make no mistake, I am not saying that English is in any way superior, or that English speakers are held in higher standing than any other.  I condemn as well careless mistakes in my native tongue.

I must say I am genuinely curious as to what you meant by &quot;at least not in the sense in which you mean it&quot;.  A spell-checker will (usually) just tell you if a word is spelled correctly, but won't cast any opinions as to its meaning or proper usage.  But a dictionary would have made obvious the mistake in, say, the usage of the word &quot;through&quot;, along with its correct spelling.  But this takes discipline and effort, and a desire to do things well.

As for my advice, there's nothing to it.  It was not meant to serve as an attack.  My point was that if you make a mistake and someone corrected it, then by all means take it, learn from it, and perhaps try harder next time to avoid the same mistake.  There is no use in feeling hurt and calling for &quot;tolerance&quot;, when the lessons offered were proper and direct.  But then again, everybody is free to complaint about anything.
