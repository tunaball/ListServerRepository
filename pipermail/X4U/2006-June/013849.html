<PRE>My suspicion is that deep down in the licensing agreement that you  
have to agree to to pay and download music from the iTunes store you  
agree to maintaining the DRM state of the music. I could be wrong  
about that, of course.

My understanding is that you can make 5 CD's in iTunes of the same  
playlist. To make more copies you need to change the playlist order  
or contents. I'm thinking 5 copies for personal use is  reasonable,  
however the other restrictions as to on what devices etc I play the  
music is a deal breaker for me.

Once you purchase an item the Music company can't go back and change  
the rules. Those early cd's (or whatever) were not DRM'd. I believe  
it will ultimately be up to the consumer as to how all of this will  
DRM stuff will come out. I choose not to use iTunes to get my music.  
I probably have around 1000 music cds in my library, I won't purchase  
locked cds nor will I use the iTunes store to purchase music. I have  
to admit that I did try it out and found the purchasing experience to  
be nice but like others have stated the restrictions are onerous to  
the point of driving me away as a customer.

</I>&gt;<i> I agree. Unfortunately, some of today's DRM restrictions were not
