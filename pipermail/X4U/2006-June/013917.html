I think _you're_ intolerant, and out of line.

I remember a trip I took, driving thru the Swiss Alps, and on the way ran 
across at least 3 dialects of German.
What little I retained from my 2nd generation German mother, who spoke some 
sort of &quot;low German,&quot; allowed me to eat, and drink, and make friends.
THEY liked it that I tried ~ which was, I found, a universal opinion among the 
people in the countryside.

The only people who didn't like a non-citizen trying out their language were 
the Parisians.
The countryside French were just lovely people. The Parisians weren't.
They were even more haughty than you are!

Bottom line, if you honestly try, don't speak ever louder when someone doesn't 
understand your inept attempts at communication, I've found they are gracious 
and helpful, almost without exception.

It is not necessary that I understand the declination of nouns and which are 
feminine and masculine.
It IS necessary that I try.

I can speak a little German, a little French, a little Spanish, and a bit of 
Cuban.
All these have served me well, and with the one regional exception I noted 
above, all those with whom I had contact were gentile and polite.

 &gt; If you fail to try speaking and writing correctly, aren't you just being
 &gt; disrespectful to the people you are communicating with?

I say no.
It depends on the attitude you carry with you.
If you're honest in your attempts at communication, eventually both of you 
will find a way to understand each other.
I do NOT need 6 years of French language immersion, except to speak to a 
Parisian...
I'm not sure I give a rat's patoot!
