I am contemplating the eventual move to intel machines and have 
researched the current Apple offerings. I find them wanting.

I don't like the idea of all-in-ones such as the iMac. I don't need (and 
can't afford) the Mac Pros.

I don't want a laptop because I think they are the most trouble prone 
and shortest lived computers, and I don't intend to carry a computer 
around with me.

So that leaves me, currently, with Mac Minis to consider.

My main concern is the memory shared between the processor and the video 
card. I want a more robust, stand alone, video card. Second to that, I 
want access to external hard drives, and I want a choice between 
firewire 800 (not 400) and eSATA.

Having said that, I deem firewire OR eSATA essential, and preferably 
BOTH firewire and eSATA, and preferably firewire 800.

But what I'd really like to see is a tower configuration priced 
comparably to the iMacs that affords options for internal and/or 
external hard drives, video card upgrades and PCI(X) card upgrades.

Apple came up with the low cost Mini. Surely they can come up with a 
budget tower and let us build it out like we want to.
