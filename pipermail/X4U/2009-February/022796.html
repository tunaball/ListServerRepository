The classical NewsReader for Mac is MT_NewsWatcher, written by Jon  
Norstad of Northwestern University and upgraded and maintained by  
Simon Fraser.  MT means multi-threaded.  That's good.  it is reliable  
and has many good features, including a good spam detector, a good  
filtering option, and other nice goodies.  Good!

Try it out!  Version Tracker has an easy (and free) download at:
