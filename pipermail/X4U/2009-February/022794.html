<PRE>I have been using HOGWASHER for about 5 years (bit more maybe) and  
have had sporadic issue with it. In OS9 it was extremely problematic  
in OS X (same version) its record is less than average. This last  
weekend it stopped working period. In the past I emailed the author  
and got zero support, so even when I shipped him many crashlogs not a  
peep. A good friend of mine got it working again but he doesn't know  
how/why he got it working other than to move some folders out of its  
main folder.

I need to replace it. The functionality of HOGWASHER was VERY good, I  
will say that. There was only 1 or 2 features that it did not have  
that I could have used and those were a nice to have rather than  
mandatory. Can someone suggest a decent replacement for HOGWASHER and  
one that is as good as or better than HOGWASHER and that is  
reasonably bug free. I would also prefer some sort of support other  
than a black hole. Cost is somewhat secondary for a really good  
product. I also need to decode all commonly used encoding methods  
used on USENET. The other important item is good filtering also good  
OS X support.

Thanks,

Ed
