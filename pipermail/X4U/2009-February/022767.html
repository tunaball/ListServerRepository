Okay, minor nit, but if you're talking about Pages, then the subject
line is incorrect. Pages is part of iWork (Pages, Keynote, Numbers) and
iLife consists of iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, GarageBand, and iWeb.

The first thing I would suggest is turning on &quot;Show Invisibles&quot; in the
View menu. That should show you the carriage returns, page breaks, etc.
Position the cursor at the bottom of everything and then just start
backspacing until you're back to a single page. Show Invisibles will
also get you closer to what you're accustomed to with WordPerfect,
showing you the formatting, etc that is being applied.

So far as the tables are concerned, are you talking about redimensioning
them (changing the number of rows/columns) or resizing them (changing
the size of the cells). The easiest starting point is to use the Tables
Inspector.

Printing just one page is easy, at least here. Choose Print and in the
Print dialog, click the &quot;From&quot; radio button and make sure it is from 1
to 1 in the text boxes.

Frankly, as much distaste as I feel for Microsoft, Word is an incredibly
powerful, flexible word processor and tracking down undesired formatting
and the like is quite simple after you've learned the tricks (the first
is &quot;Reveal Formatting&quot; in the View menu or clicking the &#182; icon in the
toolbar). WP is just as confusing to a new user or a switcher, it's just
that you're accustomed to its approach. Long-time Word users encountered
the same difficulty adapting to WP as you do to switching from it --
it's what you're used to and have mastered. Pages is a new kid on the
block, but it also provides most of the same capabilities for
trouble-shooting, just using a different paradigm. Show Invisibles and
the various Inspectors are the gateway with Pages.
