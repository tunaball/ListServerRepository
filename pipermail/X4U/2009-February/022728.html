<PRE>I have &quot;something&quot; that is changing my energy settings. I *think* its  
at boot up time (but I am not 100 percent sure) as it seems to be  
changing after it as well.

I lock the settings (7 minute) screen black out) and *NEVER* disk  
power down.

After a reboot the system works fine for about 2 minutes all of a  
sudden the screen darkens and the disk powers down.
At times I can't get into the power settings to re-lock the power  
settings it literally shuts down before I can get there . Even then  
it takes a few minutes before the system stops going into power saver  
mode. It is obviously also ignoring my key strokes and mouse movement  
(before I can lock it back up) and the damn thing just (excuse my  
language but I am totally  frustrated).
This does not happen all the time but I would say at least 50 percent  
of the time,

I get so mad when I am fighting the system that I forget the sequence  
that seems to work and the system at times does NOT go through its  
wackiness.

I have looked at startup (login) programs and nothing is really there  
that I do not remember putting there. They also look pretty standard.  
I have a few apps that have been with me since before I went to OS X  
(2+ years ago) I have been having this specific issue for at least  
3-4 months. None of the apps have anything to do with power saving  
mode except for possibly the app called Hardware Monitor (I really do  
not think this is the culprit as I just updated the version and it  
still occurs.

Any  way to tell who the culprit is?

Thanks,

Ed

ps: In the far distant past (OS9) and after I have had some  
incidences of when I do backups the system goes into sleep mode (but  
not often). I back up all of my system weekly.
