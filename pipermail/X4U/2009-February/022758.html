Thanks but I have already did that to no avail.

That is why I tried reading help. I also must say the pages is far  
from intuitive. I also have a issue with the tables I created and  
need to resize them. Resizing tables was spectacularly unsuccessful  
as well. Maybe you need to have worked at a printing plant to know  
this stuff. That seems to be an issue with all of pages IMO you need  
to have experience, which I will freely admit that the closest I have  
ever been to a printing plant is to drive by one.

I even tried telling pages just to print 1 page and it insists on  
printing both.  I am not an artist nor a type setter, I am a person  
(like most average people) that have no experience in the field, I  
would hope that MAC would at least produce a program that has either  
an expert mode or beginner. One of the reasons why I like Word  
Perfect so much is that it has display codes so a person can have an  
idea what is going on and either delete the code or to add what is  
needed in the document. Pages (to me) takes the low road and does  
pretty much what MS does (the versions I have seen) and gives you no  
clue what is going on.

That is one of the reasons I refuse to upgrade to 10.5 (or higher) WP  
will only run in classic. I would rather give up any feature to come  
in MAC so I can keep WP a product that works and you can debug it  
reasonably easily.
