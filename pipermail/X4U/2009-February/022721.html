That would be because it was a PC. SCSI isn't plug-n-play but with 
fully compliant hardware its main problem was the limit of seven 
devices + host (for basic SCSI). I ran my PowerMac 6100 with a MO 
drive, CDRW drive, one of those 5.25&quot; cartridge drive thingies, a 
hard drive or two, a scanner, and briefly an Exabyte drive 
(Retrospect wouldn't work reliably with it) in various combinations. 
I had to use 'SCSI probe' (or whatever it was called) quite a bit. I 
also have an Apollo or two, although not run up for a few years. They 
were quite happy with a 5.25&quot; tape cartridge, an Exabyte and several 
disc packs. They just worked, but the Apollo was a much more 
expensive machine.
