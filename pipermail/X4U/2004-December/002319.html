Thanks for everyone's help on this.  This CDROM worked fine before the 
x.3.7 update.  The only CD it would recognize/mount was the x.3 install 
CD.  I have a Pismo myself, that I got at the same time (upgrade from a 
Wallstreet), so I was setting them both up.  Turns out, it hosed them 
both, not just hers.

I tried every fix and suggestion mentioned here, on other lists and 
macfixit.com.  None of them worked unfortunately.  So I blew hers 
away...even though I thought I would never get it to boot off a CD, an 
OS 9.x recovery CD finally did the trick.  Installed 9.2, then 10.3, 
then I downloaded the 10.3.6 combination update from Apples site, and 
then all of the other updates except the one for 10.3.7.  Everything is 
purring right along...although I worked on it until 3:15am this morning 
so it would be ready for her first thing Christmas morning.

On mine, I booted off a 10.3 install CD and did an 'archive and 
install', which yielded the same result, but saved me some 
configuration time.  Same thing, used the 10.3.6 update, along with all 
other recommended 'software updates' except the 10.3.7.  It is also 
purring happily at this moment as I write this email.

Anyway, just in case this helps anyone else.
