<PRE>This is an odd one and may have nothing to do with it. However, two 
months ago my Airport Extreme was dropping and I had to reset it, go 
into Admin, all sorts of stuff, to get it to work again. It was a pain. 
I have a G5 2.0 GHz with an airport card and an alubook. Where we live 
we don't have cable, but a wireless router. At the same time I was 
having all this problem our ISP was putting another tower up which was 
supposed to boost our signal. I also decided to go back to the software 
that came with the airport express. Since that time I've had zero 
dropouts! Naturally, it's only the alubook on the airport, and on 
occasion I put the G5 on it, but it's not needed as  I bought the 
airport for the alubook. I also moved my airport express on top of the 
stereo cabinet.

I'd like to believe it was my going back to the older express software, 
but there were other things going on so now I'm not sure. It's worth a 
try, though. Now all I do is come home from work and the alubook picks 
up the signal. It's great! It's been going strong for two months now. 
Tonight will be the first time it's offline. I just bought a 24 port, 
100 base 3Com switch to replace the 10 base one! As soon as hubby comes 
home, we'll install it. I wish I could do it before he got home! Can't 
wait to see if it's enough speed to show when surfing, etc.
