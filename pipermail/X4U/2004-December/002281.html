<PRE>As I just experienced, it seems that &quot;customary&quot; would be to list an 
iMac with a cracked and misaligned case and missing the side door as 
being in good condition and then ship it without the mouse, and refuse 
to send it later, because  you wound up spending more than you expected 
on packing materials and feel that the buyer sucked the holiday spirit 
out of you by requesting the mouse, even though it was part of the 
purchase and they paid you for it.

Of course, don't forget to load Panther and  iLife 04 and claim that 
they got a great deal, even though they will now have to spend wipe the 
drive and track down disks to reload the original system, unless they 
are the sort who can feel good about using pirated software.

Sorry...just my two cents...


That said, I have bought and sold a number of macs on e-bay, and have 
generally had very pleasant experiences.  I think we all need to just 
make sure that we are being as honest as possible...isn't that what 
it's all about?
