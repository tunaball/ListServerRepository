<PRE>Well, I doubt it is simple, otherwise it would already have been  
done. iPhoto has been portrayed as such, but I think many of the  
people describing the slowness are testing the limits of what their  
processor and software with LOTS of images can deliver.

As an aside I do not know where the sense of &quot;there should be...&quot;  
comes from. As a visionary looking forward to a possibility, it is  
cool. As a sense of &quot;we're entitled to...&quot; it is, perhaps excessively  
expectational. When I start to feel like I am entitled to well  
designed and programmed stuff, inexpensively, just cause I need it...  
I simply remind myself how much work it takes to develop a web site  
for a client, while they express their amazement that it costs as  
much as it does... And like me, I think that the software developers  
should be paid and paid well for good products. Anyway, nuff said...

Perhaps another aside, unless one is a professional photographer, in  
which case iPhoto is WAY TOO weak, having thousands and thousands of  
images available on a local HD seems like a huge over kill. Keep the  
really good or current stuff on the local drive, off load the rest  
onto DVDs or other external HDs.

I consider Aperture to be the professional level program for image  
adjustment, processing and cataloging, but it may really require a  
Dual or Quad cpu to make it fly like we would want it to. It could be  
just another dog on a iMac G5. But then the iMac G5 is a consumer  
level machine and to expect it to deliver high-end, professional  
performance is silly.

That said, I still think some cleaning up, rebuilding databases, and  
clearing caches might help iPhoto some.

&gt;<i> ...But I don't think as a user I should have to spend so much money  
</I>&gt;<i> and go to such lengths just to get iPhoto to work. There should be  
</I>&gt;<i> a more democratic solution one that doesn't require enormous  
</I>&gt;<i> amounts of power just for a cataloging program. There needs to be  
</I>&gt;<i> something simple and fast that will run on a majority of average  
</I>&gt;<i> speed machines owned by average users...
