I've been meaning to try LaTeX for a while - it sounds very good, but 
I've been put off because there seems no way to avoid learning yet 
another mark-up language in order to use it.

I might add that every LaTeX website I've ever seen gives examples 
using the most BORING layout ever - uniformly Times serif fonts and 
looking like a university textbook. I know that it's possible to do 
clever stuff using LaTeX, so why doesn't anyone ever produce anything 
clean &amp; stylish with it?

I started using Pages this week, which is a whole different barrel of 
piscines - the less technical might well enjoy it as a 
Word-alternative. It does all your basic word-processy stuff, but when 
formatting it tends to take a document-centric view - every thing that 
you type is classified under one of half-a-dozen or so &quot;paragraph 
styles&quot;. One can change the font of a paragraph easily, just by 
highlighting the paragraph &amp; clicking the &quot;Font&quot; button, but now a 
little red triangle appears next to the &quot;Body&quot; style in the &quot;Paragraph 
styles&quot; drawer. Simply right-click the &quot;Body&quot; style in the drawer &amp; 
choose &quot;redefine style from selection&quot; and the paragraph text 
throughout the entire document will correct itself. You can do the same 
thing with headings and sub-headings, bulleted text and so on, defining 
new styles when you want to.

The document I'm working on is a semi-technical document with sections 
showing command-line input in a Unix shell, and so I have a &quot;body 
style&quot; for the text and a &quot;console style&quot; for the command-line stuff. I 
don't need to change font, change font size and alter the indentation 
each time I start a new section, I just click on my predefined style. 
If I decide to change the indentation of one style or experiment with 
Bitstream Vera Sans for the fixed-width stuff instead of Courier New 
then that's fine - I change one paragraph until I'm happy with it and 
then with a single click I can apply those changes to the whole 
document.

For instance, it just took me about 15 seconds to change the colour of 
the font &amp; background in the command-line sections of the document. I 
kinda like that colour. <A HREF="http://stuff.stroller.uk.eu.org/Pages.jpeg">http://stuff.stroller.uk.eu.org/Pages.jpeg</A>

Within a style you can have as many character styles for &quot;emphasis&quot; or 
whatever as you like, so that if you apply a new style to the document 
it won't straighten those words you've italicised - unless you want it 
to, of course. Paragraph styles include definitions of alignment / 
justification, of line-spacing, of pre- and post-paragraph spacing and 
so on. Words formatted in &quot;heading&quot; and &quot;sub-heading&quot; (or any other) 
styles are automatically added to the document index.

It took me a hour or two to get used to Pages' way of working but now 
I'm really happy with it - I'm used to highlighting the whole document 
to change (say) to justified text and then having to go back &amp; 
un-justify titles or other sections, and it's refreshing to have all 
this taken care of without having to think about it. I know that one 
can use styles within Word, and opening Word 2004 right now it seems 
much easier to do so now than last time I tried, perhaps 4 years ago, 
but it's generally not the way one _thinks_ of working within Word. My 
only issue with Pages is that I don't seem to be able to put a footer 
with a page number only on some pages - it leaps onto the title &amp; 
contents pages, too, but either I'll work out how to fix that or Apple 
will in the next release. For this document it's not really very 
important &amp; I'm just glad to be able to get on with my work &amp; not to 
have to worry about it.
