<PRE>Hello,

Recently I took my iMac G5 1.8 ghz to my Apple authorized reseller to  
check if the video card should be replaced accrodingly to the  
extended warrnty. The SN of my iMac fell into the list described on  
the Apple website. The reseller did tests on the iMac and after a  
week concluded it did not need a replacement. So i took back my iMac  
and paid a 50$ which is time and work. I was told Apple did not  
covered the fees for checking the problem. My complaint was: on  
startup for the first 10 mnutes, the screen is so dimmed, it's like I  
had manually dimmed the screen pushing to the far left the slider. I  
told myself if there is to be a problem, better do some prevention.  
The reseller told me we was happy my iMac had no problem since he  
absolutely did not trust the parts Apple send him, specially not a  
eplacement video card for an iMac. Hey, I can'y accept this answer!  
What is it? It means if ever my iMac has a problem it won't be  
repaired cause apple sends faulty parts. This is no business  
relationship. As for the 50 bucks, I was told to contact Apple and  
try to recover my money from there. On the Apple website, must say  
this is quite confusing. It reads: &quot;Note: If your iMac G5 is not  
experiencing any of these symptoms, you do not have to contact Apple  
or any Apple Authorized Service Provider.&quot; and further it reads: &quot;How  
can I tell if my computer is affected by the component failure  
identified for the iMac G5 Repair Extension Program? An Apple  
technical support representative or an Apple Authorized Service  
Provider (AASP) will need to physically examine your computer to  
determine if the component failure identified for the iMac G5 Repair  
Extension Program affects your computer and, if so, arrange for the  
repair.&quot; Nowhere it says that I have to pay something. Is it  
guaranteed or not? Help! This iMac is becominig a source of  
disappointment. Really.
