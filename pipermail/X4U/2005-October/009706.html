Yes, but there's a difference between an OS juggling multiple  
applications (multitasking) and an individual application having  
multiple threads within itself and those threads being run in a  
manner to take advantage of multiple processors. So keeping things  
really, really simple:

An application or process, in computer science terms, is the largest  
thing that is known to (i.e. runnable by) the OS. Each process is  
complete unto itself and is started/scheduled/stopped by the OS. With  
most modern OSs and hardware each process is isolated/protected from  
other processes. And since each process has a nearly complete self  
contained copy of the system resources it uses it is unusual for any  
given process to conflict with or damage another process or the OS  
itself. Multitasking OSs are written, by definition, to arbitrate  
between process and minimized resource conflicts.

A thread is a little process brought to life by a process. A process  
can start many (many) threads. Each thread lives within the context  
of and is contained by the parent process and shares most of its  
parent's resources, but can act independently. As such, it can, if  
not written properly, thrash any resource owned by the parent.

Threads reintroduce much of the badness of Mac OS Classic, but keep  
it isolated to individual processes. So why do we want them? Since  
threads share most of their resources with their parent they start up  
much, much faster and consume significantly fewer resources than  
creating a new process does. This was especially an issue on older  
hardware, but is still a factor today. It is reasonable to run 100's  
or even 1000's of threads on even small or embedded computers.  
Threads can be used to preserve an application's interactivity, even  
without multiprocessors. Potentially long running tasks can be run in  
the background via a thread, while the application continues to  
respond to the user and perform other tasks. Another advantage of  
threads is that a process's threads can communicate between  
themselves and share information with less overhead than when doing  
so between processes. All of this combines to make threads the method  
of choice for using multiple processors in an application.

A multitasking OS can juggle several applications at once. If it has  
only one processor it does so by rapidly switching between the  
various applications thereby giving the illusion that they're all  
running at once. Given a reasonable scheduling algorithm for the  
switching and reasonable behavior on the part of the applications  
this illusion holds up pretty well.

Having a multitasking OS does not guarantee that multiple processors  
will be taken complete advantage of in the way most people think they  
should be. For instance later versions of Mac OS Classic implement  
what is known as Asymmetric Multiprocessing. The OS itself runs on a  
single processor. Each application, while it is running, is assigned  
to a single processor and all of that application's work is done by  
that processor, even if the application is multithreaded. Special  
libraries (helper software) are needed to let applications take  
advantage of multiple processors in the situation and the programmer  
has to be very, very, very careful when doing this as the various  
services and resources provided by OSs have several levels of  
multithreading awareness (MT unsafe, safe, or hot) and non-SMP OSs  
tend to be mostly unaware.

OS X implements Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP). Not only does it  
distribute and schedule applications among processors, it also does  
the distribution and scheduling of threads - relieving applications  
of the need to be multiprocessor aware. SMP OSs also tend to be much  
more multithreading friendly as most services have been updated to be  
at least MT safe and MT hot where possible, thus making MT  
applications more reliable.

In short it takes both an SMP operating system and good programming  
to fully take advantage of an MP machine from both a performance and  
interactively standpoint.
