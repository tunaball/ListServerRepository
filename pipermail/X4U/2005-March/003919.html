<PRE>Anne-Marie

I would look into Netgear. I too, had an XSense M120, that 
Iupdated to the equivalent of an M130 via firmware upgrade 
several years ago. However, it became unreliable. I saw a number 
of recommendations for Netgear on a list (maybe this one, I 
don'tremember...).

I bought the Netgear WGT624 Wireless Firewall Router (sold at 
Compuserve and other retail outlets). Its wireless, but also has 
four ports for a wired network. (If you go wired only, you can 
disable the wireless).

It works great. I didn't have to complete the &quot;auto wizard&quot;setup 
-- I received a prompt saying that the router detected a 
connection and simply started working.

Perhaps you could scan their website to see if they have a 
similar 6 or 8 port model.

I have an old XSense M120 ... 4 slow Ethernet ports, one cross 
port and one DSL uplink port (hooked up to the DSL modem), with 
NAT and a usable browser admin panel. It's expanded with another 
XSense hub/router/switcher thingie (never sure of the 
distinction) that has 8 additional slow Ethernet ports.

MacSense hasn't updated firmware for it since 2001 and I'm 
prettysure the product is abandoned. The apparent replacement is 
an M130 which doesn't look/function much different, as far as I 
can tell. Their focus is elsewhere these days.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a fast, Mac OS X-savvy, 
recent vintage Ethernet DSL router/hub/switcher thingie with NAT 
and 6 or 8 ports?  Hooked up to my Ethernet hub are:
  - Color laser printer
  - Airport Express
  - 1 Lombard PowerBook (no Airport)
  - 3 G4 PowerBooks with various Airport  cards (some fast some 
slow)
  - 1 Dell 4500 S (no wireless card)

I like having the flexibility with the powerbooks to use 
Ethernet(there's ports all over the house with a patch panel in 
the basement) vs. Airport if Airport is acting flaky or can't 
geta signal. But it's okay with me if a couple of the PBs are 
Airport-only as they're used only off and on.... also I'm 
planning on adding a small file server to the network (subject 
for a future post, heh) which I assume should be Ethernet.

Thanks
