<PRE>At least, I think they're kernel panics: a box that orders me in 4 languages
to shutdown and grays my screen over wherever I was when it happened.

I use Mac OS 10.2.8 on a 17-inch flatscreen iMac, still under warranty. 

I'm pretty ignorant about how to do anything but the news &amp; legal research 
I do for a few nonprofits. I.e., I don't program (or know what things like &quot;root&quot; 
are talking about). (FWIW, I did systems design &amp; programming from 1956-1966, 
in binary, then octal, then assembler languzges, in order to develop assemblers &amp; 
then compilers, on what were then &quot;large-scale&quot; computers, so the basic logic  
of computers doesn't escape me tho' multi-tasking was just being designed when 
I changed careers. Things change.)

This problem started happening about a month ago; I called the person 
who got me set up when I got this computer, who said, &quot;yes, that
happens to me all the time&quot; and told me to try Disk Repair, and 
if that didn't take care of it, to use Norton Disk Dr. &amp; Speed Disk.
He didn't label it &quot;kernel panic&quot;--I only discovered that a couple
wks ago while trying to figure out if there is something else I
should be doing--I understood it to not be a damaging problem 
because my friend seemed casual about it (he's a sysadmin for
a publishing co).

But in the last several days, I started getting it every day; I thought maybe
it was associated w/ Sleep, because i could go all day without problems, but
the box would show up when I first woke it up in the a.m. But then in the last
few days, touching the keyboard wldn't wake it up from the black screen, and
I had to Power off, then do Norton, then it would work fine all day.

It didn't become &quot;terminal&quot; until yesterday (&quot;terminal&quot; meaning, using 
Norton Disk Dr./Speed Disk and/or Disk Repair doesn't allow me to continue 
after I start up again-- instead the 4-language box shows up as soon as I get 
the Desktop &amp; try to do anything at all.

What I find on the Web suggests it's a bad RAM or bad RAM slot?

I'm taking it to the shop tomorrow unless you tell me there's still something I
should try. 

Please pardon me for going on so long--I should have written you weeks ago.
