Right. You don't actually need to replace the M120 router, then. All 
you need is to replace the MIH-120a &amp; plug all your devices into that.

&gt;<i> Also want to move just because I don't like using abandoned products.
</I>
Well, I can see your point, but you might well find you're in the same 
situation in a couple of years' time - the smaller &amp; cheaper the 
product - think small network hardware devices - the quicker 
manufacturers update their range &amp; drop support for legacy models. To 
be honest I'd just get a new switch &amp; keep the difference in the bank - 
these little routers often keep chugging away for years. If the M120 
fails in the future, then just chuck it.

&gt;<i> Their support knowledge base has some instrux on how to update 
</I>&gt;<i> firmware on the 130 w/OS X but it's pretty convoluted, like it was 
</I>&gt;<i> never meant for OS X networks. And the latest firmware update for the 
</I>&gt;<i> 130 was back in 2001 too, just like the 120.
</I>
Yeah, but you may never need to need to update the firmware.

&gt;&gt;<i> You mention &quot;slow Ethernet ports&quot; in your first paragraph. I know how 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frustrating that can be, but you don't need to replace the router - 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only add a switch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still not clear here. I thought the switch add-on from MacSense simply

</I>&gt;<i> can you tell if the 130A (the 8-port switch) adds any special speed 
</I>&gt;<i> boost as opposed to the 130 (the 4-port router/hub)?
</I>
Erm... yes &amp; no.

&gt;<i> Wouldn't the 130A need to be hooked into the 130 in order for the 
</I>&gt;<i> computers to access the DSL modem? (Which by the way is a Slipstream 
</I>&gt;<i> if that makes any diff.).
</I>
No, I don't think so. Because the 130A is a router with a built-in 
switch. But you don't need that, since your current

&gt;<i> All so confusing... basically I want about 6 ethernet devices to have 
</I>&gt;<i> fast computer-to-computer connections and share the same single DSL 
</I>&gt;<i> account.
</I>
Right... chuck the MIH-120a &amp; replace it with a 6- or 8-port 10/100 
switch. Problem solved. $30 from NewEgg.

You might need to paste the below into textedit &amp; set a fixed-width 
font for it to make sense:

       slow          slow               fast
modem &lt;---&gt; MIH-120 &lt;---&gt; 10/100switch &lt;---&gt; LAN Computers
       10mBps        10mBps             100mBps

The &quot;slow&quot; segments are still 5x - 10x the speed of your broadband 
connection, so are not a bottleneck. The computers in your house all 
communicate at full 100mBps speed because they're all plugged into the 
new switch at full-speed. Trust me, it works, it's not a big dilemma 
and you'll REALLy notice the difference for the usage you're 
describing.

Stroller.
