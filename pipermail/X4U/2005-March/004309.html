<PRE>Richard, et All Listas
G'day!
Many Thanx to Richard for your input, but am still in need
of a few more answers, ... below mixed in... plus...

&gt;<i> I'm new to OSX and am hoping for some insight into a weird
</I>&gt;<i> warning that popped up following an unstuff of an installer
</I>&gt;<i> for NSv7.2 and then my double clicking of the resulting .dmg

</I>&gt;<i> is repeatable, even with another DL and copy over BWO Toast
</I>&gt;<i> Files &amp; Folders CD-R disk burned on my other Net connected
</I>&gt;<i> PowerMac.
</I>I'm still trying to get past this &quot;Broken Pipe&quot; warning dialogue
box, but the 17Mb+ installer seems to decompress fine to the
.dmg installer(strangely now unpacked at 53Mb in size), yet it
refuses to mount w/ only the &quot;broken pipe&quot; db in my face.
-fyi- this iMac isn't connected to anything other than power
yet.

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know about the warning but you can move your OS9 Netscape
</I>&gt;<i> bookmarks/mail etc...to the OSX Netscape/Mozilla or Firefox for that matter.
</I>&gt;<i> All you have to do is copy the folder inside your Mozilla default profile
</I>&gt;<i> folder on OS9 to same one in OSX the default profile folder doesn't have
</I>&gt;<i> your name on it but just an alphanumeric series of characters like the one
</I>&gt;<i> of the end of this example. You'll have to create a default profile in the
</I>&gt;<i> OSX Netscape first then replace that profile folder with the one from OS9
</I>&gt;<i> and restart the browser. For what it's worth I would recommend
</I>&gt;<i> Mozilla/Firefox over Netscape, it's the same basic browser only far more
</I>&gt;<i> developed than Netscape and you should be able to import all your OS9
</I>&gt;<i> Netscape stuff there no problem.
</I>I've got Safari v1.1, Firefox v1.0(w/ v 1.0.2 waiting to install), Mozilla
v1.7.5 
all loaded. And still the new iCab left to find, download and install, but
I'd 
like to have a full compliment of browsers on hand to use at will for
those 
tricky sites that prefer one over another to keep all the bases covered,
so to 
speak/type. And would anyone have a point to URL for the download of an 
off-line full installer of the newest version 1.2 of Safari??, as it seems
that 
Apple has it now all locked up into it's Software Update oNly.
&gt;<i> Home Folder/Library/Mozilla/Profiles/Default/ rfyiqe7s.slt
</I>Will the exact &quot;alphanumeric series of characters&quot; be needed on the name
to replace the &quot;default profile&quot;(whatever it's named)?
&gt;<i> As for the hard drive I would recommend putting in the biggest one you can
</I>&gt;<i> afford unless you've got another machine you'd like to put it in.
</I>Ok gotcha, then it's the new 120Gb that will go in there, and can someone
suggest a good partitioning/formatting scheme for me?, and will I need to
accomplish a less &lt; than 8Gb 1st. partition for install of boot Systems? 
Also, need I install OSX.2 and the X.2.8 combo, followed by the upgrade 
installer to OSX.3, and lastly install OS9.2x, or visa versa?, or what is
suggested?
-fyi- I don't have the full installer of OSX.3, only the upgrade CD, and 
I will need OS9 to be fully bootable.

TIA once again for all your Guru help, advice, and suggestions.

Respectful of GURUs
