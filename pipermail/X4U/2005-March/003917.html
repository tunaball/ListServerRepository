Yes, that's it, and yes, it's working at the moment. As is the 
MIH-120a switch that adds 8 ports to the hub.

The reason I want to move ... We're transferring some big files among 
the computers on the network and the 120 only does 10T Ethernet ... 
as far as I know my Macs and prob the PC can do 100T Ethernet, no? If 
I add a fileserver this will be an issue as well.

Also want to move just because I don't like using abandoned products.

Alas, I don't know what's up with MacSense. They list the logical 
replacement, the MIH-130 (broadband router w/NAT and a 4-port hub) 
and the MIH-130a (the 8-port switch add-on) on their site here:
<A HREF="http://www.macsense.com/product/broadband/mih130.html">http://www.macsense.com/product/broadband/mih130.html</A>

... but the Buy Now button is disabled and the products aren't listed 
in their on-line store.

Their support knowledge base has some instrux on how to update 
firmware on the 130 w/OS X but it's pretty convoluted, like it was 
never meant for OS X networks. And the latest firmware update for the 
130 was back in 2001 too, just like the 120.

So all this makes me think I should find an up-to-date solution. Thus 
I turned to the online genius bar here :-) for advice and 
recommendations.

&gt;<i>You mention &quot;slow Ethernet ports&quot; in your first paragraph. I know 
</I>&gt;<i>how frustrating that can be, but you don't need to replace the 
</I>&gt;<i>router - only add a switch.
</I>
Still not clear here. I thought the switch add-on from MacSense 
simply increased the # of ports... take a look at the mih130 url 
above ... can you tell if the 130A (the 8-port switch) adds any 
special speed boost as opposed to the 130 (the 4-port router/hub)? 
Wouldn't the 130A need to be hooked into the 130 in order for the 
computers to access the DSL modem? (Which by the way is a Slipstream 
if that makes any diff.).

All so confusing... basically I want about 6 ethernet devices to have 
fast computer-to-computer connections and share the same single DSL 
account.

&gt;&gt;<i>I like having the flexibility with the powerbooks to use Ethernet 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(there's ports all over the house with a patch panel in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>basement)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;greenly jealous&gt;
</I>
I paid a guy to set this up when I moved into my house in 98. He's 
since dropped off the planet and if something went blooey I'd have no 
idea what to do. Maybe that makes you feel better? ;-)
