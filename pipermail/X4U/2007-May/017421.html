My customers are frequently amazed at the difference when I add RAM  
to their &lt; 512meg PCs. I see a lot of 2 - 4 year-old Dells which were  
shipped with 256meg or even 128meg from the factory. The GUI  
latencies of these tends to make them EXTREMELY frustrating to work  
on -  512meg DIMMs are the best bang-per-buck at the moment and the  
difference one of these makes is quite astounding. Not only do I  
notice it but do my customers.

I guess that things like FSB speed and processor architecture have  
improved more in this time period, but processors' cited ghz seems to  
have increased little between these machines of 2 years ago &amp; the  
ones I see sold today. Certainly I am sure that none of my customers  
could notice the difference between a 2-year old PC with 768meg RAM  
and a brand new one with the same amount of memory (providing fresh  
installs of XP on each).

&gt;<i> I wish I had similar information for Vista, but despite lots of

</I>
I'm finding Vista slow with 1gig, but that may be the operations I'm  
doing on it - mostly copying data from the customer's old PC,  
installing applications and general configuration. There's a known  
issue with file-copy operations which cause them to be glacial to  
quite a silly degree - one could see this could easily be affecting  
installation of the many files programs copy to the h/d during setup,  
but also perhaps switching between tasks to furtle in control panel  
whilst this is going on.

&gt;<i> I'd also like to be able to quote similar figures for OS X, but I  
</I>&gt;<i> don't read Mac related publications regularly anymore, and from  
</I>&gt;<i> what I remember of them most of what passed for benchmarking left a  
</I>&gt;<i> lot to be desired. (MacBench leaps to mind.)
</I>
<A HREF="http://www.kernelthread.com/">http://www.kernelthread.com/</A> or <A HREF="http://osxbook.com/">http://osxbook.com/</A> might be worth a  
look, if you've got the time &amp; the inclination.

Stroller.
