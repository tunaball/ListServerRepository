Correct.
for most 'average' applications, one would be hard pressed to discern 
the difference between interlaced and not.
It's only when one insists on pushing the capability of viewing that it 
becomes important.
Each has it's place.

P.S. I thought my relatively new 32&quot; Panasonic flat screen TV was 1080 X 
1920, but I find it's 1080i X 1920... Oh well. It was expensive enough 
as it is!
And I must say, the resolution is pretty fine. I can live with it  &lt;big 
grin&gt;
