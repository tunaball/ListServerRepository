I'm not. I'm willing to bet that most of that 2 GB is inactive or only  
being used for I/O buffering.

My poor little 12&quot; 1.33 GHz G4 PB with 768 MB runs, umm, not optimized  
not 10.4.x just fine. With FireFox (3 windows, ~20 tabs), Mail,  
Azureus, iTunes, Terminal, Finder/OS X and all its deamons running I  
still have ~200 MB of inactive memory.

</I>
&quot;feeling a lot better&quot;, uh which benchmark is that from?

Yes, I'm being a smart-ass, but I have the disadvantage of not only  
being a software engineer, but having been trained as a scientist and  
psychologist in a program that demanded intellectual rigor. So when I  
hear people talk about the need for GBs of physical memory with no  
reference to the work being done, the benchmark which demonstrates  
that need, or being able to &quot;feel&quot; the difference between 3.5 and 5.5  
GB of RAM my BS meter goes off. (Even given that I still remember  
vividly the day my Sun workstation was upgraded from 1 to 4 MB.)

For reference, the knee of the curve for Windows XP when performing  
well defined general purpose multitasking application benchmarks is  
right around 512 MB. I wish I had similar information for Vista, but  
despite lots of hand waving about Vista's memory needs I've yet to see  
any reliable numbers published. (I'd welcome a pointer if anyone has  
one.) I'd also like to be able to quote similar figures for OS X, but  
I don't read Mac related publications regularly anymore, and from what  
I remember of them most of what passed for benchmarking left a lot to  
be desired. (MacBench leaps to mind.)

Sorry for the interruption, I now return to you the myths and  
superstition that regularly pass for knowledge on this list.
