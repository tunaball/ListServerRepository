First, check the PRAM battery. If it's the original, it's probably  
dead or close to it. If it has 3.5 volts or better, it's OK.

Next, if the battery's OK or new, then unplug the machine and let it  
sit for a half hour or so. Then press the cuda button (it's inside  
the RAM door opening and to the left and down a bit) ONCE. Then plug  
the iMac back into AC power, and do a start and a PRAM reset. Let it  
chime/gong/whatever at least twice, then release the Option/Command/P/ 
R keys. All of this restores PRAM-keeping capability and resets the  
PMU/logic board.

If it starts and runs normally, you've achieved the inexpensive/free  
labor fix. If not, then you're probably looking at a replacement of  
the flyback transformer (relatively cheap but time-consuming and  
dangerous if done by yourself) or the PAV assembly (power/analog/ 
video boards). Either way, you're looking at total disassembly of the  
unit to fix the problem.

Your description of the symptoms point to the flyback transformer.  
What happens is that the fine wire windings inside the little black  
canister lose their insulation over time as a result of heat up/cool  
down cycles. In a failing unit, everything's OK until the heat  
buildup expands the wires enough to create a short, which shuts off  
power to the screen and shuts down the computer. Leave it alone for a  
while, things cool down, and it starts normally again. This also  
could be caused by a capacitor or two on the analog/power portion of  
the PAV, but your description fits my own experience that it's the  
flyback transformer.

Flybacks can be bought for about $35, shipped. But it's a dangerous  
job because you must discharge the potentially lethal voltage in the  
CRT as part of the disassembly process.

PAV boards can be bought on eBay for less than $50 these days. Just  
make sure you've got the right one for your iMac. There were two  
models: one without a switch for LG CRTs only, and one with a switch  
that accommodated both LG and the other monitor manufacturer, whose  
name I don't recall.

Do some Googling for iMac flyback transformer replacements, and  
you'll learn all you need to know.

Good luck.
