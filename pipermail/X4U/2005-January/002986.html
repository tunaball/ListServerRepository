<PRE>Hi.

I've been dormant on the list for quite a while, and I now have a 
question that would be best answered by the wise and experienced folk 
on this list.

I don't live in the US; I live in Santiago, Chile. I have decided to 
buy an iBook, but buying it here costs about 1000 dollars more than 
buying it in the US. Luckily I have a willing friend up there who will 
help out.

The Apple Store will not ship internationally, will not accept payment 
from credit cards whose billing address is not in the US and will not 
ship to freight reshippers (I believe that's what they called them).  
This is unfortunate, as I wish to customize the iBook, adding more RAM 
and a bigger HD.

The only big retailer I could think of was Smalldog.com, but their 
contract with Apple does not allow them to ship internationally.

Does anyone here have any experience with Apple retailers that will 
customize your order and also ship internationally?

If necessary, I can always ship it to my friend's house, and have him 
send it via UPS. So my second question would be, what online Apple 
retailers would you recommend?


Thanks!


Paul

</PRE>
