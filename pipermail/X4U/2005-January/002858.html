<PRE>Sorry for the off topic but I just had to share this.

Background: Two of my buddies and I have been friends since grade 
school. Scott and I are die hard Mac users and use them at home and at 
work. Rob, although he loves using our Macs, is a PC user due to his 
job, he's never had a home computer. When Rob mentioned that he was 
thinking of getting a computer for home, we naturally started showing 
him the various Macs options he could choose from. We though we had 
convinced him to get an eMac when he surprised us one day by saying he 
had ordered a Dell.

Rob received his computer and hooked it up yesterday. The first thing 
he did once it was up and running was to email the two of us to gloat 
at how fast his new XP machine was. Scott and I, emailing each other 
privately, decided to have some fun with Rob. We both replied to his 
email claiming to have received two identical messages from him. To ad 
to the fun we sent two identical replies to him. Now Rob, thinking he's 
done something wrong starts sending us test emails which we keep 
claiming to have received two of and we make sure to send two copies of 
every emails we send him. After a while he writes us saying that he 
tried his brother and another friend and only got one reply from each 
of them and the problem seems to be isolated to Scott and I. To add to 
the fun, I send him a single email from my .mac account. then follow up 
with two from my work account. He's really confused.

We decide to up the fun. I email Scott some party pictures we had 
taken. Scott replies (twice) to me with CCs to Rob. In the quoted 
message Scott changes it so that it looks like my original message was 
also sent to Rob. Now Rob is wondering why he never received the 
message with the photos. We followed this with messages (two of each) 
asking him if he was receiving the emails with attachments we were 
sending (which of course we never actually sent). We could tell from 
his emails that Rob was getting frustrated. After not hearing from him 
for awhile he emails us saying that he's been on the phone with Dell 
and that the tech guy was having him try all sorts of things. (we feel 
sorry for the IT guy, but at least he's paid by the hour.)

We kept it going all day. I talked to Rob last night, he was so 
frustrated that he came out and said he should have taken our advice 
and bought the eMac. I guaranteed him that if he would have purchased a 
Mac he wouldn't be experiencing these problems.

Scott, Rob and I are meeting for lunch today where we're planning to 
tell Rob everything. He's usually a good sport about these things, and 
Scott and I owe him for past pranks he's pulled on us.

</PRE>
