<PRE>Lunch was fun!!

Before going, I searched the MS support site for anything to do with 
duplicate emails in Outlook 2003. I found a legitimate Knowledge Base 
page with the solution to an almost identical problem. I printed it to 
PDF then altered the PDF in Illustrator. Under 'Resolution' I changed 
the existing paragraph to read &quot;To prevent duplicate e-mail messages 
from occurring, kindly ask Scott and Mark to stop sending duplicates of 
every e-mail they send you and to stop claiming to receive two of every 
e-mail message you send them.&quot;

Well, when we got to the restaurant Rob started right away with the 
computer problems and how the IT guy from Dell was leading him all over 
the place without any success. It took everything for Scott and I not 
to blurt out laughing. I handed Rob the sheet, saying a PC tech I know 
had sent it to me. He started reading it, and kept proclaiming that 
yes, his system does this and yes, his computer does that. Then he got 
to the resolution. At this point Scott and I lost it. Rob jumped out of 
his seat cursing, threw the paper at us, called us every name in the 
book, and then cracked up laughing with us. By this point, everyone in 
the restaurant was looking at him, so what does he do? He moves to the 
front, and loud enough for everyone to hear, he explains to the entire 
restaurant what we've been doing to him. Now you have to know Rob and 
how he can talk to a crowd, by the time he was done the entire 
restaurant was in stitches. A few of them even came to congratulate 
Scott and I. But the icing on the cake is that the manager, still 
laughing, came and told us our lunch was on the house.

So go figure. We torment a friend for a day and get a free meal out of 
it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry for the off topic but I just had to share this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Background: Two of my buddies and I have been friends since grade 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> school. Scott and I are die hard Mac users and use them at home and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at work. Rob, although he loves using our Macs, is a PC user due to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> his job, he's never had a home computer. When Rob mentioned that he 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was thinking of getting a computer for home, we naturally started 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> showing him the various Macs options he could choose from. We though 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we had convinced him to get an eMac when he surprised us one day by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> saying he had ordered a Dell.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rob received his computer and hooked it up yesterday. The first thing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> he did once it was up and running was to email the two of us to gloat 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at how fast his new XP machine was. Scott and I, emailing each other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> privately, decided to have some fun with Rob. We both replied to his 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> email claiming to have received two identical messages from him. To 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ad to the fun we sent two identical replies to him. Now Rob, thinking 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> he's done something wrong starts sending us test emails which we keep 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> claiming to have received two of and we make sure to send two copies 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of every emails we send him. After a while he writes us saying that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> he tried his brother and another friend and only got one reply from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each of them and the problem seems to be isolated to Scott and I. To 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> add to the fun, I send him a single email from my .mac account. then 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> follow up with two from my work account. He's really confused.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We decide to up the fun. I email Scott some party pictures we had 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> taken. Scott replies (twice) to me with CCs to Rob. In the quoted 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message Scott changes it so that it looks like my original message 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was also sent to Rob. Now Rob is wondering why he never received the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message with the photos. We followed this with messages (two of each) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asking him if he was receiving the emails with attachments we were 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sending (which of course we never actually sent). We could tell from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> his emails that Rob was getting frustrated. After not hearing from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> him for awhile he emails us saying that he's been on the phone with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dell and that the tech guy was having him try all sorts of things. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (we feel sorry for the IT guy, but at least he's paid by the hour.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We kept it going all day. I talked to Rob last night, he was so 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frustrated that he came out and said he should have taken our advice 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and bought the eMac. I guaranteed him that if he would have purchased 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a Mac he wouldn't be experiencing these problems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Scott, Rob and I are meeting for lunch today where we're planning to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tell Rob everything. He's usually a good sport about these things, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Scott and I owe him for past pranks he's pulled on us.
