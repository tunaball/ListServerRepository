When I went to the &lt;<A HREF="http://thevoice.digium.com/">http://thevoice.digium.com/</A>&gt; site, after a few 
seconds I heard a voice welcoming me. The ending was kinda cut off - I 
assumed  that was because I'm using OmniWeb.

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.digium.com/index.php?menu=contact_information">http://www.digium.com/index.php?menu=contact_information</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> Just a clue that they use the Yahoo store for their transactions. 
</I>&gt;<i> Eeeww.
</I>
Well, I guess it's convenient for them - I wouldn't want to use a Yahoo 
store myself, as I feel it appears less professional than a branded 
image, and I haven't dealt with Digium myself but they seem an 
extremely well-respected company.

Digium are the sponsors of the Asterisk open-source PBX project, a 
powerful digital telephone exchange software which allows routing of 
calls between conventional &amp; VoIP networks. In the OP's case it might 
typically be used to connect old-fangled copper or ISDN lines to their 
office ethernet network, and users could be equipped with VoIP 
telephone handsets (which are in appearance a conventional telephone) 
or software telephones on their Macs. Unlike Parliant's PhoneValet this 
would allow users to transfer callers to other extensions within the 
office, and should the company have staff in another building calls 
could be routed over the internet. I currently use a different system 
which forwards my voicemail as attachments to my email inbox, allowing 
me to listen to them in Mail.app on my Powerbook when I'm away from 
home; Asterisk is more sophisticated in this regard, allowing 
voice-messages to be forwarded to different telephone extensions or 
email addresses depending upon which extension or phone number has been 
dialled.

Digium host the open Asterisk-Users mailing list, from which I've 
received over a thousand posts since I subscribed on the 3rd January. 
It appears they are a serious company, and it is evident that quite a 
number of consultants are implementing Asterisk systems commercially 
using their products.

I wrote a longer reply to the original posting on this subject, which 
appears to be languishing awaiting moderator approval, and which I'll 
repost in two parts if there's a demand.

Stroller.
