    Master Foo and the Script Kiddie

A stranger from the land of Woot came to Master Foo as he was eating the
morning meal with his students.

&#8220;I hear y00 are very l33t,&#8221; he said. &#8220;*Pl33z* teach m3 all y00 know.&#8221;

Master Foo's students looked at each other, confused by the stranger's
barbarous language. Master Foo just smiled and replied: &#8220;You wish to
learn the Way of Unix?&#8221;

&#8220;I want to b3 a wizard hax0r,&#8221; the stranger replied, &#8220;and 0wn ever3one's
b0xen.&#8221;

&#8220;I do not teach that Way,&#8221; replied Master Foo.

The stranger grew agitated. &#8220;D00d, y00 r nothing but a p0ser,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;If y00 n00 anything, y00 wud t33ch m3.&#8221;

&#8220;There is a path,&#8221; said Master Foo, &#8220;that might bring you to wisdom.&#8221;
The master scribbled an IP address on a piece of paper. &#8220;Cracking this
box should pose you little difficulty, as its guardians are incompetent.
Return and tell me what you find.&#8221;

The stranger bowed and left. Master Foo finished his meal.

Days passed, then months. The stranger was forgotten.

Years later, the stranger from the land of Woot returned.

&#8220;Damn you!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I cracked that box, and it was easy like you said.
But I got busted by the FBI and thrown in jail.&#8221;

&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Master Foo. &#8220;You are ready for the next lesson.&#8221; He
scribbled an IP address on another piece of paper and handed it to the
stranger.

&#8220;Are you /crazy/?&#8221; the stranger yelled. &#8220;After what I've been through,
I'm never going to break into a computer again!&#8221;

Master Foo smiled. &#8220;Here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is the beginning of wisdom.&#8221;

On hearing this, the stranger was enlightened.
