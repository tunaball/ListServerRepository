challenge/response systems are a pain in the butt for 
friends/family/businesses and ESPECIALLY mailing lists...in most 
cases i immediately delete any annoying challenge/response email i 
get. whoever uses such a system deserves the isolation.

why would you want someone else to do the work for you?

filters have grown smarter and as jerry pointed out, if you keep your 
filter trained (mark spam as spam and not-spam as not-spam), it keeps 
getting better. i get close to 300 emails a day and maybe one or two 
slip by a day. i'm using eudora 6.2 (which comes with an awesome 
spamwatch filter) but mail does an excellent job as well.

...as long as you take the time to train you filters and manage your 
spam. it's well worth the effort and doesn't leave a sour taste in 
your clinets'/friends'/collegues'/listmoms' mouthes.
