-------------
I have the .Mac settings in System Preferences set to keep a local copy 
of the iDisk, and to be synchronized automatically.  It has worked 
great up until this point.

I tried to mount my iDisk from work with my iBook, and clicking the 
iDisk icon in the sidebar did nothing.  I deleted the sidebar prefs and 
restarted the Finder.  I still couldn't seem to access the iDisk.  So I 
went to the menu Go---&gt;iDisk---&gt;My iDisk.  Nothing.  Then 
iDisk---&gt;Other User's iDisk  and manually entered my .Mac account info 
and password.  I got the error:

&quot;You cannot connect to this server because it cannot be found on the 
network.  Try again later or try a different URL.&quot;   Hmmmm.

I didn't think too much about this until I got home, where my iMac is 
configured with a local copy of my iDisk set to automatically update.  
I clicked on the sidebar iDisk icon...and noticed that the last time it 
had synced was on 1/10/05  (or 10/01/05 for those non-US readers) at 
11:59 pm.  I hit the &quot;manual sync&quot; button next to the iDisk, which then 
left a message at the bottom of the window that &quot;107 MB available, Last 
sync failed.&quot;  I guess I haven't had iDisk access for 5 days but didn't 
notice it because I have been using my local iDisk copy.

I opened Console to look at the logs, marked it a few times with my 
current time, and see this every time I try to manually mount my iDisk 
with the Go... command:

===== Sat Jan 15 2005 ===== 20:32:33 US/Central =====
Jan 16 02:33:12 localhost webdavd[655]: http_mount: WebDAV protocol not 
supported
Jan 16 02:33:12 localhost webdavd[655]: 
<A HREF="http://idisk.mac.com/michaelelliott/">http://idisk.mac.com/michaelelliott/</A> could not be mounted

I ran disk repair permissions from the OSX 10.3 CD, and got

&quot;We are using special permissions for the file or directory 
./System/Library/Filesystems/cd9660.fs/cd9660.util.  New permissions 
are 33261&quot;

But still the same results trying to mount the iDisk.

I thought my router had somehow reset to block webDav access, though I 
had the same problem with my iBook on my work connection.  Just for 
fun, I connected by  dialup to a local service provider, turned off 
Airport, and still got the same &quot;WebDAV protocol not supported&quot; 
message.

iSync doesn't complain at all when I ask it to backup to .Mac, and the 
.Mac preference pane still checks and displays my remaining iDisk space 
as usual.  I've booted from an external FW drive with a weeks-old clone 
of my 10.3.6 system, made before the 10.3.7 upgrade, and it has the 
same problem.

Anyone have any ideas on how I can get iDisk to mount again?

Michael
