</I>&gt;<i> Before going, I searched the MS support site for anything to do with 
</I>&gt;<i> duplicate emails in Outlook 2003. I found a legitimate Knowledge Base 
</I>&gt;<i> page with the solution to an almost identical problem. I printed it to 
</I>&gt;<i> PDF then altered the PDF in Illustrator. Under 'Resolution' I changed 
</I>&gt;<i> the existing paragraph to read &quot;To prevent duplicate e-mail messages 
</I>&gt;<i> from occurring, kindly ask Scott and Mark to stop sending duplicates 
</I>&gt;<i> of every e-mail they send you and to stop claiming to receive two of 
</I>&gt;<i> every e-mail message you send them.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, when we got to the restaurant Rob started right away with the 
</I>&gt;<i> computer problems and how the IT guy from Dell was leading him all 
</I>&gt;<i> over the place without any success. It took everything for Scott and I 
</I>&gt;<i> not to blurt out laughing. I handed Rob the sheet, saying a PC tech I 
</I>&gt;<i> know had sent it to me. He started reading it, and kept proclaiming 
</I>&gt;<i> that yes, his system does this and yes, his computer does that. Then 
</I>&gt;<i> he got to the resolution. At this point Scott and I lost it. Rob 
</I>&gt;<i> jumped out of his seat cursing, threw the paper at us, called us every 
</I>&gt;<i> name in the book, and then cracked up laughing with us. By this point, 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone in the restaurant was looking at him, so what does he do? He 
</I>&gt;<i> moves to the front, and loud enough for everyone to hear, he explains 
</I>&gt;<i> to the entire restaurant what we've been doing to him. Now you have to 
</I>&gt;<i> know Rob and how he can talk to a crowd, by the time he was done the 
</I>&gt;<i> entire restaurant was in stitches. A few of them even came to 
</I>&gt;<i> congratulate Scott and I. But the icing on the cake is that the 
</I>&gt;<i> manager, still laughing, came and told us our lunch was on the house.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So go figure. We torment a friend for a day and get a free meal out of 
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>

LOL  a most excellent story  !!!     :-)
