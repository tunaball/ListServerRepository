<PRE>Dave,
I use SpamSieve too, and I've had very good luck with it.

Have you tried retraining SpamSieve on both your &quot;good&quot; and your &quot;spam&quot;
messages? That helps quite a lot. For that reason alone, I keep a &quot;Spam&quot;
folder, rather than just deleting the Spam.

Also, I don't have SpamSieve automatically move my spam anywhere. Instead, I
have it mark the spam with a category (I'm using MS Entourage 2004). I can
show just the spam category, sort by sender's name or subject, and very
quickly scan the list to see if there is anything that *shouldn't* have been
marked spam. If I find one, which I rarely do, then I select it and use the
menu item for &quot;Add Good&quot; to train SpamSieve on that particular e-mail.

One last question:  how are your SpamSieve preferences set? I have all the
&quot;Filter&quot; checkboxes enabled, except for &quot;Encoded HTML mail is spam&quot;. Under
&quot;Training&quot;, I have all the boxes checked except for &quot;Allow good duplicates
in corpus&quot;. Finally, under &quot;Advanced&quot; I have the &quot;strategy&quot; slider set right
in the middle. These settings have worked very, very well for me.  When I
show statistics, SpamSieve has 1,909 &quot;Blocklist Rules&quot;, 677 &quot;Whitelist
Rules&quot;, 1,625 &quot;Good Messages&quot; and 3,390 Spam Messages in its corpus. It says
it's had a 99.5% correct rate since August 1st.

How do my settings compare to your settings?

Enjoy!

-- Jim
