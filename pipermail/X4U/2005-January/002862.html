&gt;<i> Sorry for the off topic but I just had to share this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Background: Two of my buddies and I have been friends since grade 
</I>&gt;<i> school. Scott and I are die hard Mac users and use them at home and at 
</I>&gt;<i> work. Rob, although he loves using our Macs, is a PC user due to his 
</I>&gt;<i> job, he's never had a home computer. When Rob mentioned that he was 
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of getting a computer for home, we naturally started showing 
</I>&gt;<i> him the various Macs options he could choose from. We though we had 
</I>&gt;<i> convinced him to get an eMac when he surprised us one day by saying he 
</I>&gt;<i> had ordered a Dell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rob received his computer and hooked it up yesterday. The first thing 
</I>&gt;<i> he did once it was up and running was to email the two of us to gloat 
</I>&gt;<i> at how fast his new XP machine was. Scott and I, emailing each other 
</I>&gt;<i> privately, decided to have some fun with Rob. We both replied to his 
</I>&gt;<i> email claiming to have received two identical messages from him. To ad 
</I>&gt;<i> to the fun we sent two identical replies to him. Now Rob, thinking 
</I>&gt;<i> he's done something wrong starts sending us test emails which we keep 
</I>&gt;<i> claiming to have received two of and we make sure to send two copies 
</I>&gt;<i> of every emails we send him. After a while he writes us saying that he 
</I>&gt;<i> tried his brother and another friend and only got one reply from each 
</I>&gt;<i> of them and the problem seems to be isolated to Scott and I. To add to 
</I>&gt;<i> the fun, I send him a single email from my .mac account. then follow 
</I>&gt;<i> up with two from my work account. He's really confused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We decide to up the fun. I email Scott some party pictures we had 
</I>&gt;<i> taken. Scott replies (twice) to me with CCs to Rob. In the quoted 
</I>&gt;<i> message Scott changes it so that it looks like my original message was 
</I>&gt;<i> also sent to Rob. Now Rob is wondering why he never received the 
</I>&gt;<i> message with the photos. We followed this with messages (two of each) 
</I>&gt;<i> asking him if he was receiving the emails with attachments we were 
</I>&gt;<i> sending (which of course we never actually sent). We could tell from 
</I>&gt;<i> his emails that Rob was getting frustrated. After not hearing from him 
</I>&gt;<i> for awhile he emails us saying that he's been on the phone with Dell 
</I>&gt;<i> and that the tech guy was having him try all sorts of things. (we feel 
</I>&gt;<i> sorry for the IT guy, but at least he's paid by the hour.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We kept it going all day. I talked to Rob last night, he was so 
</I>&gt;<i> frustrated that he came out and said he should have taken our advice 
</I>&gt;<i> and bought the eMac. I guaranteed him that if he would have purchased 
</I>&gt;<i> a Mac he wouldn't be experiencing these problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott, Rob and I are meeting for lunch today where we're planning to 
</I>&gt;<i> tell Rob everything. He's usually a good sport about these things, and 
</I>&gt;<i> Scott and I owe him for past pranks he's pulled on us.
