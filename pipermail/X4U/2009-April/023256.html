<PRE>thanks to both of you for your replies...

some facts:

OS X 10.4.11, Mac Mini PPC 1.42ghz, 1-gig stick, 7200 RPM External FW  
Drive = boot disk.

OK..I usually have 3D renders going 24/7, and I can tell how long  
each frame takes to render on each of two render nodes...the host  
machine was taking significantly longer than the &quot;slave&quot; node, so I  
started looking at what was wolfing down all that CPU power..

Much as I like using Drag Thing, the biggest improvement in render  
times came after I stopped using it..the host node render time was  
slashed by 1/3, and that ain't nuttin to sneeze at!

When I said &quot;keep a few windows open,&quot; I mean Finder windows..I am  
keep8ing 4 open, with one minimized in the dock, and most of the  
time, the Finder CPU usage is 0.00.

I respect what you say about whether a Finder window is trying to  
show Previews, and none of them are...I wanted to keep them at the  
ready because every time I need to do a finder operation, there's all  
that horsing around opening up and sizing and arranging the windows,  
which is dumb compared to having them just stay open, as long as my  
system doesn't take a hit, and it appears that it is not taking a hit  
as a result of what I'm doing.

These two G4 Minis are a bit long in the tooth, and I might not  
upgrade until this Summer, if at all, and I'm looking at ways to  
maximize the efficiency of the systems.  whacking 3D render times by  
1/3 is pretty huge..

The lesson is that 3rd-party interface doo-dads, while cool and  
functional, also put an undue drain on computer resources which,  
IMHO, cancel out the benefits they offer in return.

Previously I thought that keeping Activity Monitor running and open  
was a bit on the fanatical side, but I can say that it has helped me  
to keep the CPU power applied where I need it.

If you can squeeze more performance out of your (expensive) hardware/ 
software complement by changing your own behavior/what you have  
running, why not do it?
