<PRE>Part 2

Politicians  think they are wiser and more charitable than everyone  
else, apparently because they... well, I am not sure why. More means  
are constantly devised to enforce their concept of charity on the herd  
they are riding. The governed people find ways to circumvent political  
restrictions, and in return, the government, with the 'best of  
intentions' more ruthlessly enforces the beneficent idealistic vision  
of the anointed intelligentsia. Increasing utilization of government  
power to enforce charity, bestow favor, and mete out social justice is  
what Hayek called &quot;The Road to Serfdom.&quot; The most benign of  
monarchies, and the most malevolent of national international  
socialists are not different in substance only in name and degree.

Often individuals who firmly believe in government 'charity' give very  
little money to NGO type charities, and use every loophole, legal and  
often illegal to avoid paying tax for 'public investments' and  
government charities. Why are so many of the current administration  
tax cheats? Isn't the head of the House Ways and Means Committee  
pleading ignorance of the tax law when caught hiding rental properties  
in the Caribbean preposterous? Or the Treasury Secretary pretending  
that he didn't really understand his responsibilities under the tax  
code? Let's compare the  charitable records of VP Biden vs VP Cheney.

Socialism is not reviled because of &quot;The Red Scare&quot; but because many  
people understand that it ends, inevitably, in the most horrendous  
tyrannies. Every time, it begins with people saying we are different  
than anyone who tried it in the past, and smarter, and kinder and less  
corrupt, and so on. But it always ends the same. Always.

Islam is the government enforced socialism of Sharia.

Excuse me, this is not a political list. But you should know that many  
people rightfully ridicule your sophomoric pining for more American  
socialism in your tech comments.

Eric
