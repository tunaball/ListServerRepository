Got it in one! or several, anyway.

I think it's all part of the 'that was old - this is new' that we got 
with OS X. We got it right before so you're going to have to have it 
wrong now. OS XI anyone?

Another thing they haven't realised is that you most easily move a 
mouse in an arc from the wrist. The bottom of the screen is that last 
place you want a left &lt;-&gt; right selection thingy. The sides (for me) 
haven't the space. So I use 'MoofMenu' from lobotomo.com. It's not a 
Haxie, but a proper app. I used to use something similar under 
pre-OSX.
