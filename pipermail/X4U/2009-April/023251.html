<PRE>Part 2 of 2 for reply cont'd

Politics attracts immature individuals who think they are more wise  
and charitable than everyone else, apparently because they can take  
other people's money and decide what is the most charitable use of it.  
More and more ways are devised to enforce their concept of charity on  
the herd they are riding. The governed people find ways to go around  
their machinations, and in return, the government, with the 'best of  
intentions' becomes more ruthless and tyrannical in enforcing the  
beneficent idealistic vision of the anointed intelligentsia.

This is not different than what is done by the most benign of  
patriarchal or matriarchal monarchies, or the most malevolent of  
national socialist or international socialists. They are not different  
in substance only in name and degree, and whether it is one individual  
or a committee.

If you look at the finances of individuals who most firmly believe  
that this is the purpose of government, they give very little of their  
own money, and are willing to use every loophole, legal and often  
illegal to avoid giving their own money for public investments and  
government charities. Why are so many of the current administration  
are found to be tax cheats? Isn't the head of the House Ways and Means  
Committee pleading ignorance of the tax law when caught hiding rental  
properties in the Caribbean pretty preposterous? Or the Treasury  
Secretary pretending that he didn't really understand his  
responsibilities under the tax code? Would you care to compare the   
charitable records of VP Biden vs VP Cheney?

The founders of the United States government studied European and  
Middle Eastern history from the time before Rome and Greece, and  
understood that once people start giving such powers to the  
government, the government tends to become an all-powerful, usurper of  
freedoms from the people. This increasing utilization of government  
power to enforce charity, bestow favor, and mete out social justice is  
what Hayek called &quot;The Road to Serfdom.&quot;

Socialism is reviled not because of &quot;The Red Scare&quot; but because many  
people understand that it ends, inevitably, in the most horrendous  
tyrannies. Every time, it begins with people saying we are different  
than anyone who tried it in the past, and smarter, and kinder and less  
corrupt, and so on. But it always ends the ame. Always. The founders  
of Communism, Marx and Engels admitted  that if they succeeded the  
horrors of the French Revolution would be seen as a benign period when  
compared to their regime. They knew they would be labeled monsters and  
declared, &quot;Once we have power, who cares?&quot;

For many who oppose Islam, that is part of the problem, Islam is the  
government enforced socialism of Sharia. I won't reply to this  
anymore, this is not a political discussion list. But you should know  
that many people don't buy your sophomoric cliches.

Eric
