<PRE>After updating to 10.4.11 I have had two outages on the Apple Mail  
program. The first occurred approximately 2 weeks ago. I could get  
mail but not receive mail . It just would not give me any error  
message just timed out getting mail. I contacted my service provider  
(COMCAST) and asked them if they had changed any server settings  
(ports etc) and they said &quot;NO&quot;. After 2 hours on the phone they  
contacted Apple and they stepped me through the same things that  
COMCAST had done. Two things stood out one was that the port number  
had &quot;magically&quot; changed COMCAST had me put in 26(IIRC)
and that I was to use secure sockets. They (COMCAST) said no that is  
supposed to be 587 and I was supposed to be using secure sockets. I  
said fine why has this worked for over 2 years and I asked if they  
had changed anything and they said &quot;NO&quot; (I don't believe them). I  
changed  the port they wanted and *NOT* to use secure sockets. and  
guess what, it worked.

Tonight I started to getting a message from Apple mail saying the  
retrieve email was timing out. I called COMCAST and we went through  
their debugging procedure (again)  and nothing worked.  They then  
told me to stop/start email and all of a sudden it started to work.

Have I got a bug in Apple Mail or is this a case of COMCAST changing  
something and not admitting to it?

Ed

ps: When I went back in tonight the secure sockets was turned on  
(magically) and I have not touched it.
