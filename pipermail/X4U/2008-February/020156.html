</I>
While some would like to call them 'known problems', others recognize 
them as 'you've been caught' type of things. Every version of a new 
Operating System will continue to close holes and will typically 
enforce rules that previously existed but were not mandated. If 
things were done the way that they were designed to be done, user's 
typically don't have a problem.

&gt;<i>1) I should have added that I use list view in most cases (except 
</I>&gt;<i>where I need cover flow). According to you, Robert, I guess I'm the 
</I>&gt;<i>only person in the Mac world that does use list view. My apologies.
</I>
No apologies necessary. It is just that I see hundreds of users 
everyday (in schools &amp; other businesses) using their Macs and I've 
yet to see anyone use the List View in an Open File dialog. I've 
tested this in both Tiger and Leopard, and I can see no difference on 
several computers. On each version of the OS, all of the computers 
remembered the correct column to sort on, as well as the order of the 
Sort. I can not figure out a way to break it in Leopard.

&gt;<i>2) Your server permission comments are vague and probably non-applicable,
</I>
They may be not work for you but I've 'fixed' this problem several 
times by adjusting the permissions. If Apple should decide to 
'enforce' the proper placement of Applications and Documents so that 
they are not easily allowed at the root of the drive, I'll not be 
feeling bad for those that are 'forced' to move those documents are 
directories to their proper places. Many people do things because 
they are able to do things but that doesn't make them right. To have 
a secure computer, certain rules must be followed.

&gt;<i>3) Thanks for your comment about Verizon, but I was listing glitches 
</I>&gt;<i>or changes with Leopard.
</I>
Because this is not happening with all users, nor with all Verizon 
customers, it must be recognized that this is not a Leopard issue but 
rather due to something outside of Leopard. If it was a Leopard 
issue, it would affect all Leopard users.

&gt;<i>Other posters said they had the same issue with other ISPs.
</I>
Yes, other ISPs are continually changing things. ie. Comcast has been 
in the news for breaking Bit Torrent connections. Other ISPs are also 
thinking of doing the same. But because it is happening today, this 
is not Leopard's fault. If your Verizon search page is coming up, but 
another Leopard's ISP's  is not coming up, as well as another 
Verizon's user's search page is not coming up, it is time to look for 
the real problem and that would be the Verizon DNS that you are using 
rather than blaming Leopard.

&gt;<i>4) If you checked Excel boards, you'd find that others have had 
</I>&gt;<i>similar problems.
</I>
Probably non Apple keyboards that are not properly implementing this. 
If this bug is not happening to all Leopard users, then I'm not 
thinking that Leopard broke it. I'd look to some interaction of 
keyboard, drivers, etc.

&gt;<i>5) Thanks for your observation about your num lock key. Did you 
</I>&gt;<i>install the keyboard firmware upgrade?
</I>
Yep.

&gt;<i>  Apparently Apple is changing something regarding the numeric overlay.
</I>
Yep. They are not including it in new keyboards. But Leopard does not 
remove the feature from existing keyboards. Again I'd look to the 
keyboard that is being used and other drivers.

Apple is also removing the Apple logo from the Command key. And for 
many years people referred to it as the Apple key instead of the 
Command key. Calling it Open Apple worked for them but apparently 
Apple feels that it is time to stop giving them an excuse for calling 
it the Apple key.
