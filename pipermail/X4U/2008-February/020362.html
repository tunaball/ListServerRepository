<PRE>I have 5 LaCie D2 drives in constant daily use. One has been running  
for over 5 years, the others, all D2s for lesser times, but with no  
trouble. I noticed the older power supplies ran hot, so gave them fan  
cooling along with the drives. I have one of the very first SATA  
Western Digital 250 GB drives that outlasted the original case, and is  
now installed in a CoolGear case. This drive has never given any  
trouble. I have one Hitachi 250 GB drive about 2 years old, and 2  
Seagate drives, the oldest of which is ancient, and has become  
unreliable, the other is a 750 GB drive a year old that is used very  
hard but has given no trouble. LaCie has recently improved their best  
D2 drives, and I would recommend those as first choice because they  
are ready to go as received, just connect them and you can begin using  
them within minutes.

I have had other makes of drives that broke down, probably because  
they ran hot, even though they had a 5-year warranty.
