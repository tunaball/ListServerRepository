</I>&gt;<i> and that I was to use secure sockets. They (COMCAST) said no that is
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to be 587 and I was supposed to be using secure sockets. I
</I>&gt;<i> said fine why has this worked for over 2 years and I asked if they
</I>&gt;<i> had changed anything and they said &quot;NO&quot; (I don't believe them). I
</I>&gt;<i> changed  the port they wanted and *NOT* to use secure sockets. and
</I>&gt;<i> guess what, it worked.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tonight I started to getting a message from Apple mail saying the

</I>&gt;<i> their debugging procedure (again)  and nothing worked.  They then
</I>&gt;<i> told me to stop/start email and all of a sudden it started to work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have I got a bug in Apple Mail or is this a case of COMCAST changing
</I>&gt;<i> something and not admitting to it?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ps: When I went back in tonight the secure sockets was turned on
</I>&gt;<i> (magically) and I have not touched it.

The last version of 10.4 was 10.4.10 then I upgraded to 10.5.  Comcast is
one of my ISP's (the other is AT&amp;T) and since the upgrade, all of the same
settings that I previously used with Comcast work fine as well as with
BellSouth (AT&amp;T).
Upgrade my friend!  Your problems will be solved.
