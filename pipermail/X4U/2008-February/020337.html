With Eudora being discontinued by Qualcomm, Entourage is left at the  
top of the heap as the most advanced e-mail program for the  
Macintosh.  Nothing else for the Mac has as many features for the  
power-user.  However, even though I'm told that there have been some  
substantial advances in terms of reliability for Entourage, it still  
has one glaring, HUGE weakness, and that is that it keeps all of your  
archived mail in one monolithic database.  If that database becomes  
corrupted (as has been known to happen all too frequently), and it  
cannot be rebuilt, you are SOL.  Once can work-around this by keeping  
backups of one's database, but many folks prefer the security of  
using a program like Mail, which keeps separate e-mail messages in  
separate Finder-readable files.
