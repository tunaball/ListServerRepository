<PRE>I have a 24&quot; iMac and I am VERY happy with the screen.  The way it is  
set up is windows facing S that are behind me across the room.  Never  
really have a reflection problem.  My wife just got a Mac Book Pro  
17&quot; glossy screen and she has not had ANY negatives about the screen  
and reflection.  Actually it is better than her old 13&quot; Mac Book she  
had before.  I am not saying those who are having problems really are  
not have the problems as I feel each person is made differently and  
have their own needs, likes and dislikes.  I don't like bright rooms  
and the bright sun without some protection, but others (my wife) live  
bright rooms and such.  I REALLY like my iMAC but totally understand  
if another person doesn't like it at all.

I truly hope everyone can find the exact thing that works for them.

John Dach

PS  I really do not care for iMail but I am fed up with the problems  
I have been having with Eudora, my e mali application of choice for  
years, but no more........
