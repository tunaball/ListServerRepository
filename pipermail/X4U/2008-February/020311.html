I will apologize up front for tossing out a rant about disliking  
glossy screens, looks like I didn't see how annoyed I was until now  
about the iMac's being all glossy screens.

I live in northern Nevada, lots of sunshine, clear skies most of the  
time, 4700 feet altitude, high UV.  I should also mention I had  
cataract replacement surgery in 2006 and no longer need corrective  
lenses, I see better now than ever before in my life.  I wanted a new  
large screen 24 inch iMac because they suit my general needs: web  
use, email, processing photos, music/iPods, just as this list banner  
states, I'm a &quot;casual user&quot;.  My 2003 1 GHz G4 still runs 10.4.11  
just fine, but slow and straining, fine to go into another room as a  
backup but very tired for my daily use.

I've tried to get used to a glossy screen.  I've made monthly trips  
in the past six months to the closest Apple Store, 70 mile round-trip  
each time, to use the iMac I prefer.  I bought an iPod 'touch' in  
September thinking if I used it I'd see the worth of a glossy  
screen.  Not for me, sorry, too much glare, mirror-like reflections  
of me and any light in the room, or movement from the outside.  Bad  
enough on a small screen, no way on a 24 or 20 inch iMac.  I  
considered the MacMini and a display but decided the Mini was not  
much advantage over my 2003 iMac; thought about the Mac Pro and a  
display, decided it was possible but overkill.

So my Mac Book Pro is coming,  and the new 'stuff' will be fast and  
snappy, and I can buy a display if I really decide I need screen space.

Regards, Konrad.
