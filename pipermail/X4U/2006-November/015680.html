<PRE>Hi!

I have a PB G4 17&quot; (10.4.8) for 2 years. Believed Apple's hype that  
de-fragmenting the 80GB hard drive was not needed.

But, recently read other stories that it could help so purchased  
IDefrag from Coriolis Systems Limited and used it on the internal drive.

First tried it on an small external one and worked fine but took a  
long, long time. So, started it last night on the internal drive and  
went to bed.

Woke up to a much faster computer. Wow!

While perusing the files that were fragmented, noted three dmg files  
in the folder labeled /Volume/. (I found it on the top layer of the  
internal hard drive.)

There were multi megabyte files that I remember creating and burning  
to a CD 6+ months ago.

Of course, that folder is invisible so used Cocktail to see it.

In that folder were those 3 dmg files + other files that I deleted  
along time ago.

So, I deleted them all, regained more than 1 GB of space, and started  
to wonder about why they were in that folder.

Came up empty handed after reading my mac problem book I have here. A  
search of Apple's site turned up nothing, and Google did the same.

Can someone shed some light on this?

I wonder if some of you may also have files stored there, taking up  
space, that you do not need...

Hmmmmmm....

Lee
