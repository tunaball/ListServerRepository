I recent incident with a dying Linksys router - my colleague claims 
that Bonjour's excessive chattiness exposed the problem with the old 
router - it caused the old router to &quot;bleed&quot; bonjour traffic onto our 
ISP's network (the radio station is using a wireless WiMAX setup for 
Internet access).

One client of mine, back in the days of 10Mb/s Ethernet, refused to 
have Macs on the network because of the chattyness of AppleTalk (over 
Ethernet). You can't have zero-config systems that are reasonably 
responsive to change without extra chattyness. If you're using 
100Mb/s or faster networks I'd be surprised if that chattyness is 
causing network traffic problems unless you have hundreds of Macs. 
I'm sure they have a lot of Bonjour using Macs at Infinite Loop.

Your colleague seems to be using a sledgehammer to crack hit printer 
security nut. Bonjour can only find devices and services which 
publish their availability to a Multicast DNS responder (MDNS). He 
just has to turn that off at each printer.

&lt;<A HREF="http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1629">http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1629</A>&gt; says that Bonjour access to MDNS 
is via UDP to port 5353. Filtering out port 5353 at the router where 
he has his authorisation would also work.

Also see:
&lt;<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/NetServices/Articles/NetServicesArchitecture.html">http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/NetServices/Articles/NetServicesArchitecture.html</A>&gt;.


He also doesn't seem to know, or maybe would rather misunderstand, 
about Macs. He says that iTunes, iPhoto, Safari and Garage Band are 
automatically re-installed if he deletes them. He says that they are 
re-installed when a new user logs in. This would imply to me that 
they are being re-installed in the user's own Applications folder. 
Possibly by the user because they want them. I have never tried 
deleting any of these apps, so I can't say if re-installation 
happens. We can be sure that it doesn't happen with Garage Band as 
this is part of iLife which is a paid-for product. Apple isn't going 
to ensure everyone has a copy of a paid-for product for free. My 
10.6.5 iMac has all of iLife licensed and installed, except for 
Garage Band; and it's never been auto-installed.
