<PRE>For a while now, PayPal has been the only accepted form of payment by  
eBay, although another similar service has been recently added.  I do  
a fair amount of selling on eBay, and beginning early this year they  
would change your listing - or delete it if you tried to allow another  
form of payment.  As a result of all this, an e-mail from a potential  
buyer offerring some other form of payment (when the listing says  
PayPal only) looks, to the seller, like a potential scam, and they are  
frequently ignored.

eBay owns PayPal, and earns revenues on listing fees, selling fees,  
and PayPal fees.
