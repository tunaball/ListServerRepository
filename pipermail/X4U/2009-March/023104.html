<PRE>I have and use both of these packages . . .and have found both to be  
absolutely bullet proof. Slightly different modus operandi though.

A couple others you might want to look at are . . .Time Machine if  
you're running Leopard although it doesn't provide a bootable backup  
so IMO it should not serve as the only backup you have.

Synchronize Pro X or Synchronize Plus X are also nice . . these have  
very nice scheduling and also the ability to easily backup just a  
folder or three . . . functions which CCC and SD either lack or are  
very difficult to setup. SD does everything but scheduling for free  
IIRC.

I gave up on Retrospect long ago. Other backup tools that serve are  
Apple's Backup, SyncTwoFolders and probably a dozen other decent ones.  
The Tidbits folks have a nice eBook on the subject as well.

Finally . . .consider the possibility of having an online backup for  
you data. You certainly won't want to backup a whole drive this  
way . . .but backing up your documents to the net can save your bacon  
if your house burns down. Mozy and JungleDisk are probably the top two  
contenders here . . . but Mozy has a fundamental issue with Mac file  
resource forks and does not restore properly. JungleDisk costs $20 or  
so for as many computers as you want . . . plus you pay a monthly fee  
to Amazon for the drive space (it uses their S3 service) . . . my bill  
runs a couple bucks a month and I keep 15 or 20 GB out in my online  
backup.
