<PRE>Except thats not what we are talking about. If the account has already  
been hacked, then there wouldn't any more emails.

The issue that is still being explained to someone is that phishers  
will send out mass emails disguised as Paypal or other companies  
trying to trick people, knowing that only a (small?) percentage of  
recipients will actually have a Paypal account.

This is similar to an email that I received last fall telling me that  
my credit card information was out of date for .Mac. The timing of the  
email was when the anniversary of .Mac's service startup was. So I was  
ready to accept this email &quot;from&quot; Apple. Luckily, I checked the link  
destination and saw that it didn't resolve to Apple's domain.

And I, too, get daily emails from phishers purporting to be from  
banks, paypal, eBay, credit card companies, etc. And, no, those  
businesses haven't been &quot;hacked&quot;--they are just random attempts to  
fool you.

Sent from my iPhone...so replies might be short, and sometimes  
&quot;autocorrected&quot; into gibberish.
