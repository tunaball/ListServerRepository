<PRE>As you probably know my system has been sick for the last two weeks.  
Thanks for all of your suggestions but nothing help:(

I was getting to a point that I was going to toss the MAC into the  
garbage it was that bad. The hail mary idea of archive and re-install  
would *NOT* have worked in this case.

I had my local MAC guru totally stumped.

Last night I put the problem in MACWORLD MACOSX forum hoping for a  
expert out there in cyberspace to come to my aid. I got a few  
responses that as typically do not really address the issue.

The last one who answered was (I thought unlikely) suggestion. His  
suggestion was to de-install Graphic Converter. What I did was to  
copy it out of the applications folder into a spare folder that was  
not used by the system. I then copied the GC .app package to the  
trash and empty it. I then rebooted and *EVERYTHING* is working great.

What the problem was (my guess and it is ONLY a guess) that when  
the .app package was built something went wrong (I am not a mac geek  
so I do not have any idea) I am guessing something that when the  
system reads the package it needs some function of the finder to  
resolve. So the finder sat there in a loop trying to find what  ever  
*HAD* to be there and that what was slowing the finder down so it  
would not open windows and you could not do so many of the things  
that the finder is needed for on the system. I do NOT think it is an  
application coding issue but an &quot;OS&quot; thing that is needed in the .app .

I have notified Thorsten Lemke (GC owner) of the issue.


Ed

ps: Please no criticisms of how I use the letters &quot;MAC&quot; I am tired of  
this whole mess and want to go get some sleep.

</PRE>
