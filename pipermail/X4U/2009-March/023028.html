I am also mystified. I am running 1.4 of notlight and there is no  
delete anywhere (that I could find).

The only thing I can think of is that they are running the latest  
version of OS X. I went to APPLE.COM and did a search through there  
database but I really didn't find to much either on spotlight.
The spotlight systems preferences didn't say squat (that I could  
find). I am totally mystified by the discrepancy.
