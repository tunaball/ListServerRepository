<PRE>A few years ago I signed up for PAYPAL and it reasonably worked for  
about a year. Then apparently PAYPAL was hacked and I started getting  
all sorts of false requests to give out PAYPAL information. I  
resisted as I needed it from time to time. I also reported to PAYPAL  
all these phony requests. Paypal finally did something and apparently  
you had to re-register (or something its been a while but it wanted  
something like reregistering I do not remember) they started sending  
out monthly notes and I resisted reregistering then it went to weekly  
emails saying my account was going to be deleted. I thought fine  
since they wouldn't tell me how to delete my account let them delete  
it. I stopped getting phishing email purporting to be from PAYPAL  
when they deleted my account so it seemed people were still getting  
past PAYPAL.

All was fine for about a year (no more phishing from people playing  
PAYPAL). Then I was going to buy some software that only would use  
PAYPAL. I said to myself NEVER AGAIN would I use PAYPAL but I  
stumbled because this vendor would not accept any other form of  
payment. I wrote to the responsible person and have not heard back so  
either he is not reading his email or he tossed my email.

I am asking what other options are there out there? I do not mind  
using a credit card (as long as it is secure) but there are places  
that will not use anything else. What are you doing to avoid PAYPAL  
and what can someone do if they only support PAYPAL?

Ed
