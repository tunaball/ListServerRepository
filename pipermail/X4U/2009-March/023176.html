<PRE>Success!

Actually I fee a little stupid. I had seen the &quot;Convert to MP3  
version&quot; earlier in my trials and had given it a try. After waiting  
for the 15 minutes for it to convert (several times) I checked the  
file and it was still a MP4 and the iPod wouldn't take it. I was  
getting frustrated because it seemed like it should be simple. I  
looked at the links Linda sent (Thanks Linda) and saw that, other  
than a different bit rate, I was doing exactly what it was saying I  
should do. On the web site is stated that a duplicate file would be  
created with the same name but that the new one would be a MP3 file.  
I wasn't seeing the duplicate file after iTunes said it was finished  
converting. Then something poked through my stupidity. I had copied  
the original MP4 files to a playlist and was working with them there.  
The Convert to MP3 Version was in fact working but the new files were  
not in the playlist I was viewing. When I smartened up and searched  
my full music library I found a bunch of MP3 files I had created. The  
new ones are small enough that I can put them on my iPod.

Thanks for your help, Now I'm off to walk the dog and listen to a  
good book at the same time.
