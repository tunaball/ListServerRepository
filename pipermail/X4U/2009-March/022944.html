It is possible I guess. It seemed though every time I visited paypal  
I would get a few more of these. When I did forward the phishing  
email to them I would get a response saying yes we know about them or  
a thank you for reporting them.
PAYPAL must have been hacked or I would not have been getting all  
these phishing attacks telling me to update my paypal account. Even  
if they weren't I find it interesting that PAYPAL would tell you to  
update my account when the account was current with all pertinent  
information.

*IF* paypal was trying to communicate with me they blew it because  
there were *SO MANY* emails over a few months. On the OTHER extreme I  
have a monthly account that pays for USENET and when my charge card  
expires I find out because I can't login and I have to set up a new  
account. I complained to them and they say they NEVER email account  
holders for any reason. Personally I find email to me saying my  
credit card is about to expire entirely acceptable.  So there seems  
to be two extreme ways of handling issues.

I have essentially marked as SPAM any communication from PAYPAL as a  
result.  They do(did?) seem to acknowledge that PAYPAL was hacked so  
I am guessing the hack got at least members email address. No  
(erroneous) charges were ever made on my CC.

The small computer world does not seem to take security serious, IMO.  
Its even worse when companies like MS just blow smoke around when it  
comes to security.
