It also worked in Tiger.  Ed, just choose &quot;Show All&quot; after doing a 
successful Spotlight search, then use Command-Delete on items in the 
list that you want to delete.  They will disappear from the Found 
Items list as you go along.

Please either call me Mrs. Jessup or Daly. But my name is not 
&quot;Jessup&quot;. It is Daly Jessup. Unless you want me to call you &quot;Gould.&quot; 
;-)

&gt;&gt;<i>I started this question about SPOTLIGHT (being able to delete (or

No, as many have said, you can delete from Spotlight by revealing the 
found items in the Finder version of Spotlight, which you access by 
choosing &quot;Show All&quot;, which is always the first item in the list of 
your results in the menu bar version of Spotlight.
