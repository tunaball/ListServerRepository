<PRE>Retrospect Express 6 works quite well - but the user interface is

</I>&gt;<i> Functionless (AFAIK) for what I need (without paying money).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can someone suggest a good solid (and has support) backup program? I  
</I>&gt;<i> had one when I first went to the MAC that was really complicated and  
</I>&gt;<i> I spent $50-75 (or more its been over 5 years) on it and never  
</I>&gt;<i> really used it so I am a bit distrustful of backup programs,  
</I>&gt;<i> especially when they are overly complicated to either run or set up.
