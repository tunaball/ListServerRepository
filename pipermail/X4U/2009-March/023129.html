</I>
Damn it. This thread misses a whole lot.

OS neXt, as promised by Steve, is UNIX based. UNIX has had backup 
capabilities that far outperform anything offered in the for-pay 
world and the stuff is just plain free.

rsnych, cp, mv, perl, cpMac and a whole lot more are delivered with 
OS neXt and they are open-source programs that you can probably use 
as is, but if not, you, by yourself, can change them as you like.

Yes. It takes a bit of time to learn about the Mac and its UNIX side 
but it's a bunch easier to do that than to spend your time 
complaining about how others do it for you for $$$.

Get thee into Terminal.app or a BBEdit worksheet and have a look at 
the man pages for those tools. They can and will do what you want the 
way you want it but you have to take the time to learn about them.

Personally I like to maintain a file with the fully specified paths 
of the files I want to protect. A perl script that I write and modify 
as I go along, reads the file and compares dates with the backup 
disk. If they have been changed the backups get updated.  Actually I 
am now using a scheme, in perl, that doesn't replace anything in the 
backup disk but adds a copy of the current file with the current date 
added to the filename. I figure that I'll go through the backup once 
in a while and clean out old stuff. Alright, I confess, that script 
runs on ubuntu but it would work fine on OS 10.3.9 which is as far as 
I can go with my G4 sawtooth and my SE/30 file server.

And. . . I do not attempt to save operating system and application 
files. They are replaceable and the worst that can happen is that 
preference files might have to be rebuilt. Of course I have bootable 
disks for recovery but they are the ones from Apple. It's my own data 
that needs to be protected!

In short. UNIX is your friend. Steve said so. UNIX requires the 
command line but this entire thread would be zero length if everyone 
took the time to learn.
