<PRE>I'm not narrow minded at all . . .I just believe in being precise and  
accurate . . .it comes from 20 years of nuclear submarine experience  
where lack of precision and accuracy can get you and your ship killed.  
As a full time professional system administrator now though . . .I  
think I can figure out what a backup is and what a clone is. Note that  
I did not say SD was worthless . . .nor did I say that a clone was  
worthless . . .just that it's not a backup.

It's kind of like calling a sweet potato a potato. I think that  
probably the vast majority of the population doesn't think of those  
orange things when you say potato . . .because we all know that  
potatoes are white/yellow things and that those orange things are  
sweet potatoes or yams.

Same thing . . .google for the difference between backups and clones  
like I just did and you'll find that the vast majority of the  
references (except for SD) that do what SD does call it a clone and  
not a backup. Programs that claim to do backup tend to have things  
like versioning and better network destination support and tape  
support and CD support and so on.

You can call it what you want though if it makes you feel better about it.

And as I also said . . .cloning has a place in an integrated Backup  
Stragegy . . . as does backup . . .as does offsite storage.

Any competent professional who runs computer systems for a living  
would be fired if he/she just cloned drives and called it backup  
(actually, if he/she did that he/she would be neither competent or a  
professional).

Quoting Charles Schneider &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x4u.html">schneidr at umich.edu</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> SuperDuper is a backup program.  It makes an bootable backup of you
</I>&gt;<i> disk.  Can't be much simpler than that.  I think you are being a little
</I>&gt;<i> narrow minded to say a cloning program is not a method of backing up
</I>&gt;<i> data.
