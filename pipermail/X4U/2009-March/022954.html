<PRE>I wonder if you hit Reply to the possible phishing email or did you go  
through the paypal website by typing Www.paypal.com into your browser?  
Cause if the forher, a spanner may have just replied to you saying ,  
Yes, this is really from Paypal!

Sent from my iPhone...so replies might be short, and sometimes  
&quot;autocorrected&quot; into gibberish.
