Sorry I disagree. the phishers had to of broken into PAYPAL and got  
email address somehow(other friend were getting the same emails as I  
had been). I know this happened a year or two ago. I went to the  
PAYPAL site to see if I could delete my account. I gave up. I  
submitted a question to PAYPAL on how to delete my account. They  
never answered back. Other companies I have dealt with delete  
accounts with out any issue that is a major no no at paypal. If there  
is a way it is so buried that after 2 hours I gave up trying. Other  
business delete accounts all the time PAYPAL actually resists doing  
this. If on the other hand there would be a simple way to delete your  
account then we would not be having this discussion. At the time, I  
sent a communication to PAYPAL asking about this &quot;change&quot; and I got  
back a response  that it was a valid request. That was thew last  
straw. Paypal can got pound pavement. I will never have anything to  
do with them ever again especially after asking for my account to be  
deleted and they would not.
