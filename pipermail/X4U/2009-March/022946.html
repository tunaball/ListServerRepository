<PRE>Just to state it simply:

Paypal is NOT responsible IN ANY WAY for phishing attacks that mimic  
their legitimate company emails.

Phishing is criminal activity. Paypal is as much a victim of the  
crime as are its registered users who fall for the phishing.

I have received phishing emails claiming to be from Bank of America.  
I have received others claiming to be from Wells Fargo.

Are these banks responsible for the phishing emails? NO. They are the  
work of criminals, NOT the banks.

Is the existence of phishing evidence that these banks don't take  
security seriously? NO. It says nothing whatsoever about their  
security policies.

Did I get these emails because I have an account at one of the banks?  
NO. I don't have accounts at either BofA or Wells.

To blame PayPal for the phishing you encountered is just plain wrong.  
PayPal had absolutely nothing to do with it.
