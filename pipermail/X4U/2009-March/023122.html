&gt;&gt;<i> I know that SuperDuper! can do this.  I don't know if the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Open SuperDuper!, go to the Help menu, choose User Guide, scroll down to:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Storing a backup alongside other files on a destination drive&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Randy, according to the support persons email superdupper erases the
</I>&gt;<i> drive period you have no option.
</I>
Maybe the support tech minunderstood the question . . . or maybe it's  
only a feature of the paid version . . .but SD will most definitely  
clone without erasing , store backups alongside other files on the  
destination drive, and provide backup of selected folders only instead  
of the whole volume (albeit this is hard to figure out).

Hold on a sec now . . . I don't think any of us have exhibited 'die  
hard supporter syndrome. Maybe SD's feature set doesn't match what  
*you* think back should be . . .it certainly doesn't match up to my  
total definition either . . .but then you never really said what you  
considered adequate.

SD, as Randy noted . . .and this may be a paid version only feature .  
. .will most certainly not erase the destination drive if you set it  
up that way. At it's most simple . . . it's designed to clone an  
entire drive to another entire drive . . .and then do what it calls a  
Smart Update for subsequent backup runs. This was it's original reason  
for being. It has had capabilities added over time to allow backup to  
a non empty destination, backup of only selected folders, backup  
across a network to a .dmg file, and a bunch of other features. Nobody  
is forcing anything down your throat.

You asked a question . . .we're just trying to answer the question and  
carry the conversation forward.
