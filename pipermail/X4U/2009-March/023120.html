Maybe I am not making myself clear. The *ONE* feature that I am  
interested in is backup. Their backup idea is *NOT* even close to  
what I would consider proper. They wipe out the receiving drive at  
first I didn't believe it so I asked and sure enough it *DOES*). I am  
shocked that they would take that approach personally. That means  
essential you have to dedicate a drive to each back that you want to  
do. I have two drives so if I get a terabyte drive I would have to  
change it into about 5 or so partitions. I guess I am sort of OK to  
do this with a boot drive (as it has to be boot-able but I will be  
dammed to have to separate the 5 remainders into partitions for the  
data portion. I can understand their partitioning (sort of but still  
iffy) if you do not need more than one backup copy. I maintain 3  
(current, last week and two weeks ago). Also its sort of bad if you  
say you have a power outage in the middle of the backup process as  
you have to start over or your backup drives will be out of sync.

I was afraid I was going to get into this conversation with die hard  
supporters. Go ahead use the product if it fits your needs, this one  
does not fit my needs.
