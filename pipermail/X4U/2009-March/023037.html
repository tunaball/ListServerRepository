Ahhh yes there it and it *IS* grayed out.

Who ever claimed they could delete the item found in spotlight.

I was talking about SPOTLIGHT and IIRC there were 3 or 4 items I  
could find at the apple.com web site.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Was it you who said you were running version 1.4 of NotLight or was

</I>
I asked the question and included the 1.4 in my reply saying I  
couldn't see the delete option (which I can see now thanks for  
pointing out but as you indicated it was greyed out)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The spotlight systems preferences didn't say squat (that I could  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> find). I am totally mystified by the discrepancy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  If you want to delete from Spotlight try the Show All routine.

I give. We are talking over each other. I will drop the subject.
