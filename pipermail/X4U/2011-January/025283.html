<PRE>In keeping with the suggestions, (thank you, thank you, thank you!!!)  
I have tried both USB ports on the G4, and my classic ipod with a 30  
gb hd in it does charge  when plugged into either USB port. I have  
reread the specs that came with the 17&quot; g4  and it says that it has 2  
USB 2.0 ports.

Just for further info, when I am trying this drive, there is NOTHING  
else plugged into any ports except external power. WiFi is turned on  
but not blue tooth. Current power power when full is 100% with a 5564  
milliamp capacity indicated (bought a large battery to replace the  
original) and there are 154 cycles on the battery.

Someone on another list suggest that I try a powered USB 2.0 hub, and  
another suggested trying to find one of the cables that allow one to  
draw power from two USB 2.0 ports for a drive. I appreciate those  
comments, but before I do that, I will give the drive away to my niece  
and get a firewire  drive.

I was hoping there was an easy fix, or maybe a program that can force  
mount it once and then once I did that, it would behave nicely after  
that...

Kirk (Kirk McElhearn &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/x4u.html">kirkmc at mac.com</A>&gt;) (Thanks Kirk) suggested that  
maybe my USB ports were not powered.
So, i tried both. Still not mounting.
I also tried another USB to micro USB cable
I can use either USB port to sync my ipods ((a nano and a classic) and  
also to power a head set when I talk on skype.
So, my thinking is that both USBs are powered...

Subject: Seagate 1 TB hard drive issue not loading on desktop...

Have a new, out of the box seagate 1 TB external USB hard drive (with  
a mini USB connector on the drive itself)
Per Seagate, the package says:
Software / System Requirements OS Required Apple MacOS X 10.4.8 or  
later, Microsoft Windows Vista / XP
Manufacturer Part# : ST910004EXA101-RK

Plugged it into a G4 17&quot; mac running 10.5.8 (all system software up-to- 
date) and the light on the hard drive comes on.
Does not mount on desktop.
Opened disk utilities. Not there.
Restart G4 from a pristine 10.5.8 loaded on another external hard  
drive (FW 800) and still the seagate drive does not load on desktop.
Go to wife's machine (PPC G3, 10.4.11, all software up-to-date) and  
plug it in.
Shows up on her desktop.
Reformat it for Mac extended journal and attach it to G4.
Not on desktop.
Repair it using Disk Utilities on G3, (showed no problems) attach it  
to G4. Not on desktop.
Put it back on G3, and remotely connect (share) the G4 to the G3 and I  
can see it on the G4
Run Diskwarrier on the drive from the G3, and then bring it over to  
the G4.
Still not on desktop.
I am plum out of ideas....
Went to seagate's web site and they are of little help
Suggestions on how to get it to load onto my G4's desktop??
