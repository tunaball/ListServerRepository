Sorry, gonna have to tell you to back off on this one, saying something is true doesn't often make it true... fragmentation is less of an issue than it was, for some of the reasons mentioned (better seek ahead, larger space, etc), but only for lots of users. I've seen too many machines that didn't have filevault turned on, but that gave a &quot;disk was responding too slow&quot; error in things like iMovie that went away once the disk was defragged. How you choose to do it is up to you, and whether or not your usage would benefit, but the benefit can be there. It's kind of like virus utilities or firewalls... they might not seem necessary in OSX, but lots of users will find them of value, and not just psychologically.

As for why you might want a utility over something like copying to and from a drive... good defraggers don't simply defrag the individual files, they're often very smart about watching usage patterns and grouping specific/types files together for much less head seeking. Unfortunately there's nothing I really trust for this on OSX at the moment. :/
