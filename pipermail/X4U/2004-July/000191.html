<PRE>What a jerk. I've put a filter on him too.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> well, whenever i hear the word &quot;defrag&quot; or &quot;norton&quot; (or both words in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the same sentence), i think of the word &quot;inexperienced&quot; or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;incompetent&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that you may be seeing things in too black and white a manner 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that you are being too harsh.  This list isn't just for video or audio
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> professionals.  And even some professionals look to do things as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inexpensively as possible for minor jobs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i didn't think i was being harh...just honest. but if i came across 
</I>&gt;<i> harshly, i apologize. i just get fed up with all these costly third 
</I>&gt;<i> party over-hyped, over-rated third party &quot;solutions&quot; to a &quot;problem&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> that really isn't a problem if the user follows the common sense, 
</I>&gt;<i> long-term-solution route.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;if the user needs to work on video, sound, photo editing, etc., that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> person needs a scratch disk. you need room to work on this kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stuff. a raid-0 scratch disk is ideal (two internal or external
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> drives striped together).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hobbiests can't always afford to go with the best possible hardware
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setup.  Often they are looking for the minimum setup that will work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effectively.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i would hardly call getting an additional drive a &quot;best possible 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware&quot; setup. what does a 40g hard drive cost? $30? not a bad price 
</I>&gt;<i> for a long-term solution. what does a third party &quot;defrag&quot; application 
</I>&gt;<i> cost? how long does the user's &quot;perceived&quot; increase in speed last? 
</I>&gt;<i> once again, MY goal as a sysadmin is to steer people towards a 
</I>&gt;<i> LONG-TERM solution...while marketing people want you to spend money on 
</I>&gt;<i> ANYTHING they can sell you without actually &quot;fixing&quot; the &quot;problem&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> (read: norton or any other third party &quot;defrag&quot; utility).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;using a defrag utility does not address the root issue...having a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scratch disk is the solution for these types of workstations. i'm not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;talking about educational environments...i'm talking about
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> breat+butter high intensity shops. service bureaus, video/sound
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> production, digital photography shops, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ...try recommending a defrag utility to any competent mac support
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> person in these types of environments and see what kind of response
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you get.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You are on a general Macintosh discussion list, not a specialized one 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multi-media professionals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the solution is the solution regardless of whether you're a 
</I>&gt;<i> professional or a hobbyist. my clients are all professionals but ANY 
</I>&gt;<i> user can benefit from having a scratch disk or a larger drive. it's 
</I>&gt;<i> not JUST a solution for pros.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In any case, calling me, or anyone on a list such as this, names, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questioning my expertise and motivations when you have no knowledge 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> background, is, in itself, uncalled for and unprofessional.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i wasn't name calling....but the words &quot;incompetent&quot; and &quot;norton&quot; in 
</I>&gt;<i> my (and in may other sysadmins) opinion belong in the same sentence. 
</I>&gt;<i> that's an opinion that i'll stick to...i've seen techs RUIN terabytes 
</I>&gt;<i> of data by whipping out ttpro (whached modification dates in a shop of 
</I>&gt;<i> 300+ prepress pros)...i've seen many 600g raids destroyed by techs who 
</I>&gt;<i> foolishly ran &quot;speed disk&quot; on it (how long do you think it takes to 
</I>&gt;<i> restore 600g of data from backup tapes?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a person's skill level is reflected by their approach to resolving 
</I>&gt;<i> issues...not by their background. i've trained many mac techs with 
</I>&gt;<i> yeeaaarrsss of experience but little common sense. many of them live 
</I>&gt;<i> and die by third party utilities and gui wrappers...until they're 
</I>&gt;<i> shown a different approach. the ones that listen retire norton and 
</I>&gt;<i> stick to fsck/applejack/diskwarrior, and ditch the rest of their toys 
</I>&gt;<i> in favor of long term solutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We welcome  your participation here and contributions, but please 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leave the invective for the schoolyard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> stop being so sensitive. your posts are so geared towards third party 
</I>&gt;<i> software solutions that one can only think there's a financial 
</I>&gt;<i> motivation to steering people away from the tried-and-true, common 
</I>&gt;<i> sense solutions (buying a scratch disk as opposed to running a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;defrag&quot; utility).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> having a &quot;co-author&quot; signature doesn't excuse you from acknowledging 
</I>&gt;<i> there are OTHER solutions, many that are better than some of the third 
</I>&gt;<i> party solutions you're suggesting. claiming that home users should use 
</I>&gt;<i> solutions different from &quot;professional&quot; solutions doesn't fly...and 
</I>&gt;<i> you know it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> there's absolutely NO reason to steer people away from getting a 
</I>&gt;<i> scratch disk. only a marketing person or someone who has something to 
</I>&gt;<i> gain from &quot;defrag&quot; utilities would suggest otherwise. in some cases 
</I>&gt;<i> (and this is a general statement), incompetence and inexperience steer 
</I>&gt;<i> people to the highly marketed &quot;solutions&quot;. if that offends some 
</I>&gt;<i> people, then those people need to step back and re-think the whole 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;issue&quot; of degragging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> none of my comments were offensive...just honest feedback based on 
</I>&gt;<i> what i've read on this list. there's no reason to split home users and 
</I>&gt;<i> pro users into different groups with different solutions. knowledge is 
</I>&gt;<i> power (at least the marketing folks know that).
