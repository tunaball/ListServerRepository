well, whenever i hear the word &quot;defrag&quot; or &quot;norton&quot; (or both words in 
the same sentence), i think of the word &quot;inexperienced&quot; or 
&quot;incompetent&quot;. i create mac builds for a living (os9, osx, etc.) for 
many high intensity shops (read: no schools). the build is only half 
the equation. the other half is making sure the hardware is set up 
right.

if the user needs to work on video, sound, photo editing, etc., that 
person needs a scratch disk. you need room to work on this kind of 
stuff. a raid-0 scratch disk is ideal (two internal or external 
drives striped together).

using a defrag utility does not address the root issue...having a 
scratch disk is the solution for these types of workstations. i'm not 
talking about educational environments...i'm talking about 
breat+butter high intensity shops. service bureaus, video/sound 
production, digital photography shops, etc.

...try recommending a defrag utility to any competent mac support 
person in these types of environments and see what kind of response 
you get.

your response to me was a little troll-ish, wouldn't you say?:

...i trust common sense.

in the same article, you'll see:

   &quot; For these reasons, there is little benefit to defragmenting.&quot;

</I>&gt;<i>So Apple hasn't shut the door to defraging and it might still be reasonable.
</I>
i don't think so. the reasonable solution is to get a scratch disk or 
larger drive if you're running out of room. how much time do you 
think will go by before the lack of space will pose problems again?

if you're going to accuse me of attacking someone, have the courtesy 
of including the smiley face after my comment...some would consider 
creative editing an attack in itself:
