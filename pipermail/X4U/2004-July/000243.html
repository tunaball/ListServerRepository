The easiest setup I've had is to get the router to do DHCP with fixed 
MAC -&gt; IP mapping for the normal hosts.  It's all set up in one 
place, and all hosts just need to be set to use DHCP.  My first SMC 
Barricade did this fine.  The one that replaced it when the first one 
cooked has that facility, and others, removed :-(
Going back to putting each host's details in its Network Prefs for 
each Location is prone to errors as I use 2 ISPs, cheap evenings &amp; 
weekends/full price, wireless/wired for 2 laptops, modem on 
router/internal modem ... .  If we could put the details in a conf 
file rather than have to use a GUI ...
