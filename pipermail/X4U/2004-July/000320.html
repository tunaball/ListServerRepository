<PRE>Hi Stroller,
I did find that my AGP Graphics G4 uses a two-part modem:
The two parts of the modem consist of:

  The DSP - The Digital Signal Processor, is the board which generates 
the modem's signals and talks between the computer and the DAC. This 
board is located on the main logic board.

  The DAC - The Digital-to-Analog Converter translates the digital 
signals coming from the DSP into analog impulses which the phone lines 
can interpret. This is located on the rear of the computer's case.

Every Power Mac G4 (AGP Graphics) ships with a DAC attached to the rear 
case. Those that don't have the internal modem do not ship with a DSP 
board but have the DAC mounted to the side so the modem jack does not 
show.

Perhaps I can find a used DSP (and cable) and install it.

I did find several specific models of 3rd-party external modems 
available for Mac in the Macintosh Products Guide:
<A HREF="http://www.guide.apple.com/">http://www.guide.apple.com/</A>

It is my understanding that Panther faxing only works with internal 
modems, but an external modem with decent fax software might be just as 
good if not better.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe the &quot;internal modem&quot;, on my mirror-drive-door G4, at least,

</I>&gt;<i> the RJ11 socket (&amp; replace it with a blanking plate) or build the 
</I>&gt;<i> machine without some other very small component or board.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have not been able, however, to determine how to retro-fit this 
</I>&gt;<i> item, however, and fear you may be out of luck. The best offer I had 
</I>&gt;<i> was a Mac-specialist supplier offer me a part for c &#163;100. I doubt that 
</I>&gt;<i> an internal PCI modem intended for a PC would work in a Mac, although 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be delighted to hear that this is the case. Perhaps some other 
</I>&gt;<i> user with a built-in modem can post the full details for System 
</I>&gt;<i> Profiler.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Will appreciate comments on built-in faxing in Panther, of which I am 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ignorant. I know that some fax software is quite good, and some of it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is awful. I prefer a modem supported by decent fax software. TIA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would have thought that you would be quite well-served by Panther's 
</I>&gt;<i> built-in software - it has the sorts of features that most people 
</I>&gt;<i> require &amp; is integrated as part of the o/s, so that anything you can 
</I>&gt;<i> print you can fax just as well to anyone in your address book. I think 
</I>&gt;<i> that if you were to add another modem recognised under OS X (an 
</I>&gt;<i> external USB, for example) then Panther's fax facility would work with 
</I>&gt;<i> it.

</I>&gt;<i> I have heard users on this list say they use other software than 
</I>&gt;<i> Panther's built in facilities, but I think that is only because they 
</I>&gt;<i> require the sorts of features normally associated with mail-merging.
