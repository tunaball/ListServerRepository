<PRE>I have my home network setup as mostly static with a small range 
reserved for DHCP assignments so my Netgear router can assign an address 
to my tablet pc or my notebook from work.

You set up your router for example as 192.168.0.1.  This becomes your 
gateway address for all machines on the network.  I define the range of 
192.168.0.201-232 as the DHCP assignment for temporary notebook 
assignment.  You then set up an manual address without DHCP enabled  on 
your workstations in the range of 192.168.0.2-200 with a netmask of 
255.255.255.0.  I tend to reserve 192.168.0.233-254 for IP based 
printers, access points, and other IP based equipment.

 The reason I use static at home is I support Winblows boxes, older 
Macs, newer Macs, Sun workstations, Sgi workstations, a BeBox and 
several NeXT workstations.  I even have a couple od DOS system with 
TCP/IP loaded that are connected to the internet.  DHCP is not available 
or has serious issues on some of these systems as well as I like to have 
everything neatly assigned so I know it's address.

You need to disable DHCP on the workstations and enter the address 
manually, and also enter the routers LAN address and the addresses pf 
the DNS servers provided by your ISP.  The router will still have it's 
WAN address assigned automatically.  On the Windows 2K box, just go into 
the connection properties and select &quot;Use this Address&quot; in TCP/IP 
properties and  enter the address.  The netmask will calculate 
automatically and then manually enter the gateway and DNS addresses.  
You probably won't even have to reboot but IE will have to redetect 
proxy settings the first time you browse.  I don't have my 10.2.8 
machine up at the moment but it was set up static as well.  Someone else 
can step you through that one.  If you have any classic systems just set 
up the address in the TCP/IP control panel as well as the same addresses 
for the gateway and DNS servers.
