<PRE>Dare to take a Dremell to your iTrip? Check out the link to the 
schematics for the 'iTrip Amp'. A funny pick of an iPod FM bumper 
sticker.

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a summary of my experiences with my iTrip FM radio 
</I>&gt;<i> transmitter.  Thanks to everyone who responded to me. My original 
</I>&gt;<i> question to the list is at the bottom of this email.  A special thanks 
</I>&gt;<i> to Kevin Mantooth who replied to me multiple times and also pointed me 
</I>&gt;<i> to the forums at:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ipodlounge.com">http://www.ipodlounge.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where I discovered I was not alone with my iTrip problems.  Why 
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally it would work OK, the transmitter could not be any 
</I>&gt;<i> further than a foot away from my car radio.  I had one suggestion to 
</I>&gt;<i> remove the antenna from my car.  That was not an acceptable solution.  
</I>&gt;<i> I also spoke with a sales rep from my local Apple store at the Willow 
</I>&gt;<i> Bend mall and discussed my problem.  Normally I get great service and 
</I>&gt;<i> support from the Apple store.  In this case, the sales rep just looked 
</I>&gt;<i> at me like I was an idiot and all but called me a liar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, after much Internet searching, I came across this link:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/diy-itrip-amplifier-016317.php">http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/diy-itrip-amplifier-016317.php</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which describes the building an amplifier for my iTrip.  As I have an 
</I>&gt;<i> high end head unit (factory) in my car that I had no intentions of 
</I>&gt;<i> swapping it out, this appeared to be my only solution.  The first step 
</I>&gt;<i> was to open up my iTrip.  As I had no idea what type of circuitry was 
</I>&gt;<i> inside, I (very carefully) used a file to open it up.  There is just 1 
</I>&gt;<i> flat circuit board inside.  If I had to open another one, I would go 
</I>&gt;<i> after it with a Dremel tool.  I filed through the top and the bottom 
</I>&gt;<i> welded seams.  The plastic case is ~2 mm thick.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To get to the punchline, I did NOT end up building the amplifier.  In 
</I>&gt;<i> my case, I discovered that the transmitter antenna, which is a piece 
</I>&gt;<i> of copper cable roughly 4 cm long, was fully bent over and was 
</I>&gt;<i> touching/shorting out on the internal circuit board, which in turn, 
</I>&gt;<i> was causing my problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After opening the case on the iTrip and discovering the short, I have 
</I>&gt;<i> bent the transmitter antenna in 2 positions.  First, straight up.  In 
</I>&gt;<i> this position I can now put my iPod any where in my vehicle, and it 
</I>&gt;<i> works great.  No static, no bleed over.  I can take over just about 
</I>&gt;<i> any station.  Second, is bending the antenna transmitter over, into 
</I>&gt;<i> the top seam where I opened the iTrip.  In this position, 
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics are similar to having the transmitter antenna straight 
</I>&gt;<i> up, but during dead/silent time between songs, I have static.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its great to now have my iPod work in all my vehicles, and now, 
</I>&gt;<i> quality wise, my iTrip works approximately as well as any incoming FM 
</I>&gt;<i> radio station.  And it didn't cost me any additional money.  Also, I 
</I>&gt;<i> believe that I am still legal.  I don't believe that it would have 
</I>&gt;<i> been legal to use the amplifier, as shown in the url above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only downside is that I have somewhat ruined the aesthetics of my 
</I>&gt;<i> iTrip. And I now have a concern that If I keep moving the iTrip 
</I>&gt;<i> transmitter antenna (copper wire) around, that I will break it off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this summary can help someone else.  In addition to input from 
</I>&gt;<i> list members, I spent a lot of time searching the Internet, as there 
</I>&gt;<i> was not very much RTFM'ing that I could do from Griffin's web site, or 
</I>&gt;<i> the documentation that shipped with the iTrip.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank to everyone who replied to me, both online and off,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jerry K
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if there is any interest, I can put together a short web page 
</I>&gt;<i> documenting  my experiences with pictures of my iTrip's innards.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have just purchased my first iPod (3rd gen), and with it, an iTrip

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Currently, I have found a couple of places to tune my iTrip to that
