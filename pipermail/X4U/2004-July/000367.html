<PRE>Hello Kevin,

Thank you for your reply.  I live in the Highland Village/Lewisville area.  I do 
work as a contractor, and just about anywhere I go, its about a 30 + mile drive. 
  Why I have yet to exhaust every station possibility, I also see alot of drift.

I have had one suggestion that would probably work, which was to remove my 
antenna.  I don't think that I will do that, as I would miss Russ Martin.

Thanks for the tip about the taped down wire.  Can you give me any pointers as 
to which message boards that you are referring to??  Are these from the Griffin 
site?

Once again, thanks for your reply.  I will post a summary, whether I find 
something that works well for me or not.
