I receive the digest form of this list, as well as HomeMac and iBook. 
This one seems caught up and back to normal now, since the latest 
digest contains current posts. HomeMac is back on track, too--though 
the traffic on that list is light, so it's kindof hard to tell. The 
iBook list has been the most problematic. Whereas the digest floods for 
the other lists were manageable, the iBook list is generating digests 
containing everything from 2001 on. For a few days, I received one 
digest per day, which is about right, and it took me awhile to notice 
that they contained old posts. Since Sunday evening, I've received well 
over 400 digests, I'm getting out-of-space emails from my isp, 
unsubscribing hasn't worked, nor have emails to the &quot;real person&quot; or 
any other address I can find. The good news is that we're now at the 
end of March 2004, so I'm hopeful that everything will soon be back on 
track.
