I am in the same situation as you, as Panther's fax facility was not 
available when I ordered my G4, I'm on ADSL &amp; just generally didn't see 
the need for dial-up access. Since I became self-employed I have 
realised that a fax would be immensely useful.

&gt;<i> What advice does the list offer for choosing an internal or external 
</I>&gt;<i> modem for this G4. Are internal modems specific to certain models of 
</I>&gt;<i> G4s, or are they pretty much interchangeable across all G4s?
</I>
I believe the &quot;internal modem&quot;, on my mirror-drive-door G4, at least, 
is part of the system board. When I asked Apple to save me &#163;18 &amp; build 
my G4 &quot;without&quot; a modem, I think that all they did was either remove 
the RJ11 socket (&amp; replace it with a blanking plate) or build the 
machine without some other very small component or board.

I have not been able, however, to determine how to retro-fit this item, 
however, and fear you may be out of luck. The best offer I had was a 
Mac-specialist supplier offer me a part for c &#163;100. I doubt that an 
internal PCI modem intended for a PC would work in a Mac, although I 
would be delighted to hear that this is the case. Perhaps some other 
user with a built-in modem can post the full details for System 
Profiler.

&gt;<i> Will appreciate comments on built-in faxing in Panther, of which I am 
</I>&gt;<i> ignorant. I know that some fax software is quite good, and some of it 
</I>&gt;<i> is awful. I prefer a modem supported by decent fax software. TIA.
</I>
I would have thought that you would be quite well-served by Panther's 
built-in software - it has the sorts of features that most people 
require &amp; is integrated as part of the o/s, so that anything you can 
print you can fax just as well to anyone in your address book. I think 
that if you were to add another modem recognised under OS X (an 
external USB, for example) then Panther's fax facility would work with 
it.

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/faxing/">http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/faxing/</A>&gt;

I have heard users on this list say they use other software than 
Panther's built in facilities, but I think that is only because they 
require the sorts of features normally associated with mail-merging.

HTH,

Stroller.
