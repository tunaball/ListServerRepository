I'm pretty sure that the file &quot;~/Library/Application Support/ 
AddressBook/AddressBook.data&quot; contains user data for Apple's  
AddressBook app. (Note: &quot;~/&quot; means &quot;in your home folder&quot;). I think  
you'll find that if you close AddressBook, rename this file &amp; reopen  
AddressBook then you'll start with a fresh sheet. There's also an  
AddressBook.data.previous file in the same folder.

Outlook is not the same as Outlook Express - they're really  
completely different programs - which is why you couldn't find  
the .vcf options. Generally speaking .CSV files are a good way to  
transfer contacts - these are plain text files with data fields held  
as &quot;Comma Separated Values&quot;, so you may find it helpful to open them  
in TextEdit or similar just to check the exported data.

I'm sorry I can't offer much else in the way of advice - this is the  
sort of undertaking most of us only have to wossisname once, and we  
thereafter try as hard as possible to forget the experience.

Stroller.
