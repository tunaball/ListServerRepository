<PRE>&gt;<i>  &gt;Earlier in the year, there was an upgrade called the &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;AirPortBaseStationUpdate2007001 &lt; it turns out you can find this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>original v.5 software inside the content packages. Once you have this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>original software the ability to upgrade to v.5.1 can be done.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Apple, in all its selfish wisdom, has also removed this original
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>update for download. ??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I recently bought an Apple Airport Extreme base Station refurb, but the
</I>&gt;<i>software included was v4.2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The Update you are referring to requires v5.0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What hardware was v5.0 of the Apple Software supplied with,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>and how come it is not readily available?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Curious, and so long for now, TOM

Hey Tom,
In fairness to Apple (something they aren't always with us - fair 
that is) v5.0 didn't come with this particular model of Extreme base 
station. I already was  running v4.2 with my earlier Graphite model. 
However, from what I have read the Airport Utility v5.0 and the 
subsequent v5.1 upgrade provide a much nicer interface to the Airport 
base station software, at least from the reports I've read. The v5.1 
upgrade is available but if you don't have the original CD with v.5.0 
you have nothing to upgrade and the v5.0 isn't available for 
download. ??

Just don't understand why Apple wouldn't provide the full software 
package for download. Obviously, it would only be for existing 
Extreme base station users. Not like anybody else would be 
interested. Instead of leaving the aforementioned &gt; 
AirPortBaseStationUpdate2007001 &lt; (which had the v5.0) they go and 
pull it from available downloads ??

Again, if anyone has the Airport Utility v5.0 or a copy of the 
AirPortBaseStationUpdate2007001 archived would sure appreciate a 
copy. You could email off the list.

Thanks,
Rod
