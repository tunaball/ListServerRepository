<PRE>With all the StuffIts we have installed in the studio here (20 or so) I 
pretty much see that all the time. I thought they would have fixed it in 
the past few releases but it seems to have been there (from memory) in v8 
to v10.

I also concur that it makes no difference to the unstuffing results, 
however we also have had the odd archive that unstuffs all the way to the 
end and appears to just hang. In the beginning the designers used to give 
up after 5-10mins or so and tell me it was failing but after a few tests 
we found that if you wait long enough.... sometimes 20-30mins on larger 
archives it will in fact complete the decompression. I think only a few 
times it really appeared that it was never going to stop and we gave up on 
it.

For these reasons we MUCH prefer to work with zip files. They are much 
faster to compress and de-compress and they are more reliable. If you zip 
a file under OS X 10.3 and above the resource forks are maintained. 
Zip-ing a file under 10.2 and under will strip them.

Cheers,

Coj

Re: [X4U] drop stuff huge time estimate






I believe I tried what you are talking about once before, and IIRC, 
resources were stripped from the files, causing major problems for me.
this was a couple of years back, tho...have things since changed?

Why not use the zip archive feature built in to OSX?
