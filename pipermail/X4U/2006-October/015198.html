<PRE>This question deals with a Trojan horse on the Mac and anti-virus software.

I have a situation I&#185;m at a loss to understand and could use some help from
someone who may have encountered it before.

I have installed some Mac&#185;s at my church&#185;s office. They have both Mac&#185;s and
PC&#185;s for now. The local cable company that supplies the internet access
stopped the outgoing mail because they said four of the machines (3 PC&#185;s and
1 Mac) were infected with something that is sending out msg&#185;s. They named
the offending PC&#185;s by e-mail, including the Mac. Only one of the PC&#185;s is the
big problem, apparently sending out a msg every 3 seconds, and the other two
PC&#185;s and one Mac were only sending a few msg&#185;s.

Sounds like a Trojan horse installed itself on the PC&#185;s and is causing the
big problem. Norton Anti-virus was up to date and did not catch it. I&#185;ll
figure out how to clean the PC but I&#185;ve never heard of a Mac getting the
same thing that infected a PC. And what do I run to clean the Mac? I didn&#185;t
buy any Mac anti-virus because I didn&#185;t think Mac&#185;s would get Trojan
horse&#185;s.

My questions are: Is the cable company correct? Did the same Trojan horse
infect the Mac &amp; the PC&#185;s? And if so, how do I clean the Mac of the Trojan
horse.

If you have a suggestion to how to clean the PC I&#185;ll take it too. Norton
Anti-virus did not detect it.

Thanks,
