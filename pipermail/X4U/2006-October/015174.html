If it points you to an executable file you STILL have to EXECUTE it to 
get in trouble, for Pete's sake! Once you get to the site &quot;buried&quot; in 
the TinyURL, it will show itself, and it's up to YOU to know what you're 
looking at.

I don't think so. The best level of safety is knowing something about 
computers and the web. If you receive ANY downloadable file, it's up to 
YOU to download it. If you don't like the looks of it, simply don't 
download it!
Folks could send you virus-laden files all day long, and if you don't 
download or open them, you're safe.
Yeah, I know, there are exceptions, but the general rule is, don't mess 
with files from someone you don't know.

If you get bit, chances are 99+% that it was your incaution or ignorance 
of 'net rules that got you.
