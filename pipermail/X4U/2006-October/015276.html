My experience is that the date that matters is the date you brought it in
for repairs. Regardless of whether they finish the repairs after Oct. 31,
they're not going to charge you. The problem would really be if you got it
back and issues reappeared a month later. Then it could get dicey with
AppleCare support and you will have to hope they are lenient, which they can
be.

&gt;<i> The reason I got Applecare was as an insurance policy to cover any dead parts,

That was a mistaken assumption. Apple rarely allows its customers to replace
parts themselves.

&gt;<i> BTW, I feel rather ripped off.  I bought the G5 in the middle of November,
</I>&gt;<i> and there records show it was the 14th, yet the Applecare expires on the
</I>&gt;<i> 31st of October.  This does not make me happy.  Is this standard?
</I>
Did you actually purchase the machine on Nov. 14? I know I had mistaken the
length of my warranty based on the date I registered with Apple, which was a
few days after the actual purchase date. AFAIK, it's supposed to be based on
the original purchase date.
