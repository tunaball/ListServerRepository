Apple will not sell the Superdrive seperately. It is not available as an
upgrade part. I have tried to purchase one and they wont sell. It's
because it is a DVD recorder. There are licensing restrictions associated
with DVD recorders for Apple.

There are lots of personal reasons for upgrading your computer. You
should however know that your iBook is upgradable. The hard drive can be
changed although, it's not a job for the faint of heart (I did break an
important part on my first try. The second try was completely successful.)

&gt;<i>How to buy:  I am about 2 hours away from the Apple Store in Bloomington,

</I>
The primary benefit to going to the Apple Store, is potential immediate
satisfaction. They may or may not have your computer in stock. If they do
not, then they just order it through the web site anyhow. Prices are
always the same.
