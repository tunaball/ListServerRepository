Thanks for all the good info.  I need to figure out how to look up stuff in 
Apple Knowledge's base.  I  was at Apple's web site for about 2 hours and 
came away empty handed.  You must be quite the sleuth!

I was at CostCo and found a Western Digital EIDE  HD for $149.95.  It is 
160GB's. It was only when I got home that I saw on it &quot;Mac OS 10.2.X or 
later; G4 required.

I have a scooped up 7600 with a Sonnet G4 running at 700 Mhz.  I am now 
running 9.1.  Sonnet requires you to install it's patch, then you can load 
Jaguar.  I am running the Sonnet PCI controller card (Tempo Trio) that has 
a external Firewire and USB port, plus the ability to run 4 EIDE devices 
(like HD's, DVD drives etc):

<A HREF="http://www.sonnettech.com/product/tempo_trio.html">http://www.sonnettech.com/product/tempo_trio.html</A>

I guess Jaguar will support the drive, but I am not sure how I am going to 
get there from here. &lt;g&gt;

One solution that would empty more out of my pocket book, would be to 
install two EIDE drives.  One could be small enough to support 9.1.  Then 
when I make the jump to Jaguar from 9.1, I could use Jaguar to init the 
160GB drive.

Do you think that the disk init utility in 9.1 will see the 166GB drive, 
but allow me to break it into useable partitions?  That solution would cost 
me less money.

If it were not for the Goodwill, I could not afford to do all of this.  But 
I will have a nice machine when i am done (I  hope).  Folks sure toss some 
nice 'ol Macs to the Goodwill that still have some life in them.  A dead 
7200 was $10.00 and a working but stripped 7600 was $15.00. Between the two 
I  found over 500MB of RAM.  I found the rest on the web for $21 each for a 
168 pin 128MB DIMM stick.

Thanks for your help.  I love 'ol Macs.  I am just not smart enough to 
figure out all of the stuff I want to learn yet.
