I don't know if this will work on OSX or not but....

You could hold down CMD-OPR-P-R keys on boot.  Wait for two chimes, than 
see if the Mac will boot.

If not, shut it down, boot, and then see if the tray will eject.

If that will not wok, maybe try holding down the C key on boot  to see if 
it will eject the tray (but try the CMD-OPT-P-R key combo first)

I remember working on my neighbors iMac.  The Mac would not boot, and a CD 
was stuck in the drive.  I opened up the door of the CD tray (with the Mac 
off) and found a small wheel (like the gear of a clock).  Using a small 
screw driver blade, I kept turning the small wheel, and finally the door 
opened a little, and then I pulled it out.  Then I dropped in a bootable 
CD, then rebooted holding down the &quot;C&quot; key. All was well after that.

*note*  Don't break your new computer doing something stupid  (like 
sticking a screw driver in the CD drive).  I did it because he had no 
money, and nothing to loose.  When I manually turned the wheel (you might 
need a flashlight to see it), the tray came out a little, then I pulled the 
CD tray out all the way.

While his Mac is working great to this day, I don't know if this is the 
proper thing to do.  So think twice before doing something that may damage 
you Mac. I don't want to talk you into something that might break you Mac.

Other folks on this list know *way more* than I do about Macs, and can 
probably give you a better idea.

Keep us posted!!
