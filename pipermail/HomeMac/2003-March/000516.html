<PRE>  Thanks for your step by step help  -  I now have 9 partitions on my 80 gb  
hard drive to supplement my 3 gb ibook  -  the instruction manual was there, 
somehow I had not accessed it the first time I looked at the disc. Also I did 
not realize immediately that volumes and partitions are the same.

I see this is your second request with this question, so I will try to 

help.


If you have not already, connect the external drive and turn your 

computer and the external drive on.


The drive should have come with software that has an application on it 

to initialize the drive. So install the software on your main drive if 

it is not already. Since there is no way for me to know what the name 

of the program is to initialize your new drive, you will have to find 

it on your own. Once you have determined which one it is, launch it. It 

should show a list containing your internal drive and the new external 

drive. Click on your external drive.


Now usually there is now an option for a Custom Setup or a name similar 

to that. So if there is one choose it and it should show you the 

partitions on your new drive. I would assume there would only be one 

presently. So you then can change the number of partitions to 2 or more 

if you like. Also, make sure you have MacOS Extended chosen since you 

have 9.2. Once you have determined the amount of partitions you want, 

choose &quot;Initialize&quot; or &quot;Partition&quot;.


You must realize that each initialization program is different in the 

wording and location of all of the features. So by reading this over 

and using the info in your particular program should get you through 

the process. You could also find the program and look it over and post 

back with any questions that I did not answer before you do the actual 

partitioning. Maybe if you post back with the name of the application 

you have, others may also have it and help you out.


Hope this helps.
