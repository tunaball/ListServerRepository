</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
This is consistant. The way OS X deals with DOS foramatted disks is
different from OS 9.

&gt;<i>For example for some files and folders that I had created on the Zip 
</I>&gt;<i>disk while running under Jaguar, when running under the OS9 boot-up are 
</I>&gt;<i>seen as pairs of files:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Vemmy1.PSD and ._Vemmy1.PSD, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have no idea what the files are that the OS9 Finder shows that start 
</I>&gt;<i>with ._
</I>
In unix, files that begin with a . are hidden. The ._ file is probably a
folder. It probably contains the resource fork and additional
information. It could just be a file. In that case its the second file of
an AppleDouble format. (AppleDouble is a way for the Macintosh file
system to store Macintosh files on a file system that doesnt have
multiple-fork files).

&gt;<i>Maybe this is the way OSX saves file attributes when the file resides 
</I>&gt;<i>on a non HFS (ie. non native Mac formatted) media. Under OS9 I also saw 
</I>&gt;<i>.Trashes and .DS_Store on the Zip disk.
</I>
Yes. .Trashes is the trash folder for the disk. .DS_Store is desktop
database information for the Finder.

&gt;<i>My spin on this situation is that (1) it is an artifact of using PC 
</I>&gt;<i>formatted media on the Mac, (2) our ordinary files are seen with our 
</I>&gt;<i>ordinary file names (not starting with a 'dot'), and (3) this is 
</I>&gt;<i>nothing to worry about except for the inconvenience of sorting through 
</I>&gt;<i>the clutter of the extraneous file names.
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>I'm reformatting my MS-DOS format Zip disks to Mac format as I

</I>&gt;<i>So far searching the Apple knowledge base and also using Google I 
</I>&gt;<i>haven't found any thorough discussion of this, which is surprising.
</I>
How would you have it handle it more gracefully? The Macintosh file
system requires additional meta-data (additional information about the
file) as well as needing to support a resource fork (basically a second
file) associated each file? 

The probelm stems from a change from the way OS 9 does it to the way OS X
does it. If you are in the middle switching between 9 and X then you will
see this problem. I guess the problem is that OS X ignores how OS 9 dealt
with DOS disks. That's a bug.

The worst part is that the files are not compatible. As long as you stay
away from Resource-required file formats, you'll be ok.
