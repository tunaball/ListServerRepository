<A HREF="http://www.newtontalk.net">http://www.newtontalk.net</A> ;-) Don't say I didn't warn you.  Very very very
chatty list.  But still very cool to see a group that active with a machine
that's 5 years old.

New innovations?

There are hardware people who create audio dongles and are working on new
backlights.  There are software people who create games, utilities, and sync
apps.

Why do I use a Newton?

Most people will say because the Newton does stuff the Palm can't.

Hope of a revival?

&gt;<i>From Apple? Nah.  A while back there was a discussion of a group wanting to
</I>go into business to create new Newtons, but that was tossed aside as a very
impractical idea. =)

Some recent discussion from the list:

&quot;My Newton is used for playing games primarily, occasionally I venture
to put a contact on it, but invariably, as discussed early I spend my
time on ridiculously stupid games (yet wonderful). Having strived for
years I recently completed the following&quot;

&quot;So, the bookkeeper handed down the law on billing and I had to find a way
to
print an invoice onsite. The Palm won't do this without an add-on app, and
even then, it only prints with the built-in apps, and some packages like
Documents to Go. But the Newton prints natively.&quot;

&quot;I also use the Notepad to write all sorts of notes and outlines and
checklists. I have mine and my family's various measurements in there,
in case I find some article of clothing cheap. I have various
passwords, and other items I may want on hand. I also use the Notepad
to enter new addresses for the address book (using Drag and drop names
to enter them into the address book). The Notepad is my most-used
application.&quot;
