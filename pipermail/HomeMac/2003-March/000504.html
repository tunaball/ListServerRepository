<PRE>I see this is your second request with this question, so I will try to 
help.

If you have not already, connect the external drive and turn your 
computer and the external drive on.

The drive should have come with software that has an application on it 
to initialize the drive. So install the software on your main drive if 
it is not already. Since there is no way for me to know what the name 
of the program is to initialize your new drive, you will have to find 
it on your own. Once you have determined which one it is, launch it. It 
should show a list containing your internal drive and the new external 
drive. Click on your external drive.

Now usually there is now an option for a Custom Setup or a name similar 
to that. So if there is one choose it and it should show you the 
partitions on your new drive. I would assume there would only be one 
presently. So you then can change the number of partitions to 2 or more 
if you like. Also, make sure you have MacOS Extended chosen since you 
have 9.2. Once you have determined the amount of partitions you want, 
choose &quot;Initialize&quot; or &quot;Partition&quot;.

You must realize that each initialization program is different in the 
wording and location of all of the features. So by reading this over 
and using the info in your particular program should get you through 
the process. You could also find the program and look it over and post 
back with any questions that I did not answer before you do the actual 
partitioning. Maybe if you post back with the name of the application 
you have, others may also have it and help you out.

Hope this helps.
