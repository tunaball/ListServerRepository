That's an interesting observation, but why would Word name something
FINDER.DAT? Here are some questions that might help:

- How is this volume formatted? Is it a standard HFS volume or is it a
DOS formatted volume?

- Where did the Documents in the folder come from? Did you create them or
are they from a download or received from someone else? Copied from a
server possibly?

A little Google research shows that these files and folders are typically
created by Mac OS when it encounters DOS formatted volumes. If you copied
these files from a DOS volume potentially from a server then these files
would appear. I believe these files and folders are hidden by the DOS
file system manager so when you move these files to another volume they
are no longer hidden.

These files should not have appeared by simply copying the files over.
The file system would ensure that the files were correctly copied over
intact. These could have come from a stuffit file or zip file for example.

If this is a DOS volume, then OS X is doing thing different from OS 9
which is highly likely. Potentially, these files are not useful at this
point. Basically any information stored in the resource fork has been
disconnected from the file. If the resource fork file size is 0 then
you're ok (most of them are probably 0).

The answer, I believe is in the source of the files or the format of the
volume.
