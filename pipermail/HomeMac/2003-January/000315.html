&gt;<i> Well, if you need the Apple CD Audio Player program, I can send it to you.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Disclaimer:  In on OS 8.6.  Can anyone verify that 9.x uses the same

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to a CD on my computer since. Now that I want to both listen and copy one,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my computer says the disc is unrecognizable. With OS9.0, I was able to both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> listen and copy (in fact, I was able to both listen and copy the ones which

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, when I go to the Apple site, I can find nothing concerning Apple CD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Audio Player except that iTunes is now replacing it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This might be off subject and I don't feel I truly have the answer. I
remember when I bought 'The Matrix' DVD back when before I upgraded from 8.1
to 8.5. And I remember you had to have that &quot;Foreign Access File&quot; added that
was not included. I thought 8.6 and epsecially 9.x and subsequent revisions
made this a thing of the past witha Audio CD being unrecognizable. This was
a common problem vack then but I have never had a problem playing any AUDIO
CD's in OS 9.x . I could be wrong though. I would definately check your
system extensions as Nevin suggested.               Rob
