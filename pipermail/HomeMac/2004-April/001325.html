<PRE>Duane,

That image was from Thunderbird, and it is not Thunderbird that has the 
problem, it is Mail.app. Since you are using a Mac mail reader, you may 
or may not notice it. When I used Mail.app, all links from Mac mail 
programs worked when received, but if I sent to a Windows or some other 
Mac programs such as Thunderbird they would not. When I switched to 
Thunderbird my link problem was eliminated for sending, but since 
Mail.app sends improper links, Thunderbird realizes they are wrong and 
they don't work, as they shouldn't when they are improper. My daughter, 
my friend, and I, all had or have the same problem with Mail.app.

Here is a small sampling of photo's of reply letters from PC users when 
I used Mail.app. Notice the links in the photo's.

Here is a small sampling of letters I received when I sent links to 
friends using Mail.app. It was embarrassing!

***************
Guy,
I can never look at any of these links that you send me concerning your 
trips.
I have to go to your Index for Teegate to look at them.

I finally got around to looking at the links from the other email, and 
really liked the water reflection photograph.  I am not able to just 
click on your links.

Paula

****************
Guy, the links you sent are broken up. They are giving me trouble.

Bob

So I switched to Thunderbird and here are the results:

Thanks for fixing your mail program so I can click on the pictures now 
(much easier).

 &gt;&gt; I am testing out a mail program called Thunderbird and want to test a
 &gt;&gt; long link. Tell me if this works for you.

Guy,

Works like a charm.
