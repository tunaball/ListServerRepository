Probably a stupid question, but will 3 ipods work on my old G4?

At present I have a shuffle for my oap exercise  and also load classic
for my husbands Nano

 I gave him for Xmas.

I have just ordered the big one for ME!! Now worrying that it might
clash with 

his in some way. I do keep separate folders for us both. <fontfamily><param>Helvetica</param><smaller><smaller>
