Before I do anything stupid, I would like some advice on how many
ipods one

can re load etc on one computer.

I have had had the pleasure of an ipod shuffle for some time, and all
went smoothly.

my husband laughed at me being 'with it' so made him try it.

Result - bought an ipod nano for him for Christmas, and loaded it with
many many hours of

classical music and spoken word for him - at 80 plus he is delighted
with it!!


Went to reload my ipod shuffle - message I needed to update- so did.
Now no response

to my dear little shuffle, and it seems a bit dead!  Have looked
through Apple help sections

but not much good.


Had bright idea this am of restarting in 9 and using the itunes there,
instead of using my normal

10.3.9.  Using a fairly old G4 but keep it updated and 100 + disc. (my
first mac was a dear little

grey box, now in a museum!)


Is this a daft idea?? 

Be grateful for any help to make my ipod shuffle live again.
