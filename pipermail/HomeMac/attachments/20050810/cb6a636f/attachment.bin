Dear Jim

Have just printed out your reply - so that I can keep it in my
emergency file on desk!!


Have just used safari - had not realised how good it is compared to
Explorer!

Don't quite understand earthlink - not clear what it is.

(am a 'silver surfer). Should I download this as well - or is there no
point as if will use safari 

and am .com user.
