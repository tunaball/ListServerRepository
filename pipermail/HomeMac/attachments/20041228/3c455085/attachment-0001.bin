Jane,

       If I remember correctly you can still see your files in OS9 but
you have to go through /Users/Jane Sprando/Desktop  to locate them?
They are there somewhere

However, when I am running 9.2.2, where are the files/folders that are
on

the OS 10 desktop? I can't find a file and I need it!

</excerpt>I can't test it, but I doubt that you will see OS X
files/folders while

booted with OS 9.  I don't think it will recognize them.  I know there

are people on this list that can give you the definitive answer with
all

the techno jargon.  I hope they answer, I would like to know.
