That does sound like there's a problem. One thing to try is to open the
Console (Applications/Utilities) and see if there are any messages sent
to the console that can help you determine what has happened. 

The first thing I tell people when they want to move to OS X is ditch
Classic. If a significant part of your computer work is to be done in an
application in Classic then you don't want to move to OS X. You should
upgrade the program to an OS X version if you can, find a different
program with the equivalent functionality, or don't upgrade to OS X. 

I don't use O, so I can't really help you out here. If you _really_ want
to OE instead of any of the other many OS X savvy email programs, then I
would scour the mac help web sites looking for clues; Apple Discussion
Boards, Mac OS X Hints, MacInTouch, and MacFixIt are a few that I read.
There are likely more. 

Sorry, I couldn't be of more help. Maybe other's have had a better experience.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You can still use command-option-esc to kill programs.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For you current problem, I think you're being impatient. :-) I'm guessing

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but also Classic. That can take a while.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Go to System Preferences and choose Classic. Select the Advanced tab. You

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You should also consider updating. Your OS 10.2.2 is old a crufty. Update
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the latest 10.2 at least, if not 10.3 if you have it. (Panther has
