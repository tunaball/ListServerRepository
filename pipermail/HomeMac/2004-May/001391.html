<PRE>John,

On the second machine, try going to Users/username/Library/Preferences
and deleting the com.apple.finder.plist file. If you want just move it
to the desktop and after a restart if it does not solve the problem,
just replace it.

On the first machine, when you click once on your drive and highlight
it, and then Get Info on it, what does it say your permissions are? Read
&amp; Write?

I am not a Terminal expert, so I can't help you with the Terminal, but I
can tell you how to log into root and change permissions.

( For members who use X and don't understand the Terminal, you may want 
to do this also to set up root access )


Go into the Applications folder and launch the NetInfo Manager. Go into
the &quot;Security&quot; menu and choose &quot;Enable Root User&quot;.

Put a password you will not forget in the second and third field. It
will then ask you to put in your Administrator password and you then can
quit NetInfo Manager. You now have root access set up.

Now go into the System Preferences and click on the &quot;Accounts&quot; icon.
Click on the &quot;Login&quot; options and make sure the &quot;Display Login Window
as:&quot; is set to &quot;Name and Password&quot;.

Now go into the Apple and log out. It will log you out and up will come 
two fields. Type  root  in the first field, and type your root password 
that you just made into the second field. Now log into root.

Once into root, highlight your hard drive, and Get Info on it. Turn the 
&quot;Ownership and Permissions&quot; triangle, and once that opens turn the 
&quot;Details&quot; triangle.

Next to the word &quot;Group&quot; it should say &quot;Admin&quot;, and next to &quot;Access&quot; it 
should say &quot;Read &amp; Write&quot;. If not, change them.

Then log back out and back into your account. Then see what happens.

Here is a photo of my settings while in root.
