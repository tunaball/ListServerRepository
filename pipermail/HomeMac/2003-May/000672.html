I have always used epson printers and think they print great BUT i have 
now bought a hp 920c which i find better than the epson it prints great 
is silent compared to the epsons and also it is more protected from 
dust because it pulls the paper from underneath instead of the top. 
That said now i'll tell you why i went from Epson to HP
with epson i would need to buy a new printer every year because of 
problems with the printer head nozzle thing it would get clogged up 
every year and would print worse than i can write, also with the paper 
feed being on top lots of dust would go inside. The Hp on the other 
hand has the paper feed in the front and even if dust did go on the 
paper it leaves it in the tray and doesn't bring it to the head because 
the top of the paper you see is the other side not the printed side, 
and about the inkjet head clogging up it's not in the printer it is in 
the ink refill so every time you change the cartridge you have new 
print head too. Did i mention it makes half the noise of the Epsons?

anyway thats my 2 cents

Richard
