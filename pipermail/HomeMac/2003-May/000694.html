I wouldn't, unless you have a specific need for it, for two reasons. 
First is just a matter of keeping it simple. The second is that unless 
you really know why you want to partition, and what will go on each 
partition, there's no way to know how big you should make them. You 
can't go back and change your mind without wiping the entire drive and 
starting over.

</I>
Its always seemed to me that the faster the drive is, the longer it 
takes for the CD/DVD to show up. I'm guessing that's because it takes 
longer for the drive to spin up to the faster speed and stabilize.

&gt;<i>  Also, when I ejected the CDs, they were very warm to the touch. Is
</I>&gt;<i> that normal for the iMac?
</I>
That's normal. The iMacs are pretty compact, so everything warms up, 
even if not in use. In a minitower, there's more space between the 
heat-generating parts and the drive. Plus there's usually better 
cooling since they're made for more stuff to be packed in.

&gt;<i> 3. Energy Saver ---- I remember that we have had some discussions 
</I>&gt;<i> about it.
</I>&gt;<i> What should I set it to?
</I>
Personally, I'd leave it as-is unless you run into trouble. If you do 
have trouble with your system not waking, then turn it off.

&gt;<i> 4. The clock in 10.2 ---- how do I get it to show up in color?  I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't see
</I>&gt;<i> any options for that.
</I>
i didn't know you could do that!
