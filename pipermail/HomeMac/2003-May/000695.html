<PRE>&gt;<i>Now that the iMac dilemma has been solved, the search is on for a printer. I
</I>&gt;<i>have been looking at the Epsons. The price isn't really a factor, I just
</I>&gt;<i>included it for reference.  I am torn between buying a printer with the best
</I>&gt;<i>resolution or going for all the photo bells and whistles. (And I know Duane
</I>&gt;<i>is going to ask me what I want to do with the printer! LOL) I probably will
</I>&gt;<i>print some photos, but basically print what just a normal home user would.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The C82 has a resolution of 5760 x 1440 dpi, prints borderless photos on 4x6
</I>&gt;<i>glossy photo paper; black ink is water resistant; about $130-140.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The 825 has a resolution of 5760 x 720 dpi, 6 color photo inks, roll paper
</I>&gt;<i>support for 4x6 photos, has built in card reader adaptor; prints with or
</I>&gt;<i>without a computer; BorderFree printing up to 8 x 10 photo lab quality
</I>&gt;<i>photos; about $180.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The 925 has all that the 825 has, but also includes the ability to crop,
</I>&gt;<i>resize, store; includes the 4 x 6 roll paper and cuts automatically; about
</I>&gt;<i>$250.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have not researched any of the HPs or Canon printers. But I am open to
</I>&gt;<i>them. If any of you have comments or suggestions about these, please bring
</I>&gt;<i>them on.
</I>&gt;<i>

I love my Epson printers.  My old 1520 is the most versatile printer 
I have ever had and I love it.  I have used many HP printers and have 
given them away or packed them away.  I print lots of photos and the 
color that I get from the Epson is the color I see on my monitor.  I 
could never get the color quite what I wanted on any of the HPs I 
had.  It also prints text well and fairly fast and I can do both 
sides.  I don't know what a newer model number would be that is 
comparable to my old 1520.  I bought it close to 6 years ago.  Other 
than running cleaning sheets through it occasionally and dusting it 
off, I have had no problems with it.

There are a number of selections for printing - from 360 dpi up - I 
cannot check easily at the moment as it is connected to my older 
machines.

I bought a 2500 when I had to switch to USB connections with my newer 
machines but I use my old PowerTower 210 with my 1520 for printing 
most of the time.  It too is a good machine but does not have the 
versatility of paper size that the 1520 has.

Just my experience........
