It depends on (a) which users should have access to them, and (b) 
whether or not you want Classic applications to have access to them.

&gt;<i> When I store them in either the main &quot;Libarary - Fonts&quot; folder they

</I>
Huh?! Either that or which one?

&gt;<i> why would I want to store fonts in two different places?
</I>
Five, actually. Plus the application's own folder. Plus the support 
folder (if you're talking Adobe). For very good reasons, if you stop to 
think about the fact that X is fundamentally a networked multiuser 
environment. Read more at

&gt;<i> Bigger question - why did Adobe give up on OS X?
</I>
Technically, that's called begging the question. The question being 
begged is, &quot;Did Adobe give up on OS X?&quot;

&gt;<i> Are most people buying Suitcase now?
</I>
It appears that, as far as font management goes, Font Reserve and Font 
Agent Pro are the main alternatives to Suitcase. The former has been 
recently purchased by Extensis, so its future may be in doubt.

&gt;<i> I was hoping to continue using Outlook Express for my mail
</I>
Hardly. There's no OS X version of OE.

&gt;<i> (Apple Mail doesn't seem all that powerful)
</I>
It isn't. If you want power (&quot;I rewired it&quot;), check out Mailsmith or 
PowerMail. But, judging from your subsequent question, I suspect power 
isn't exactly what you need. Give Mail.app a try, you might find 
adequate for your needs. Or, if you still yearn for 'that Microsoft 
look', check out Entourage. It's bundled with Office X or you can buy 
it separately.

But if you're new to OS X, my advice is, at first go with the defaults. 
Try to use the apps bundled with it for a couple of weeks, until you 
figure things out. Then you can decided whether your needs are served 
better by other stuff or not.

&gt;<i> when I copied Outlook Express over to my new computer from the old one 
</I>&gt;<i> (network) it didn't bring over the address book, archived messages, or 
</I>&gt;<i> nothing.  How can I resolve this problem and not loose all that info.
</I>
Look for the Microsoft User Data. That's where the stuff is kept.

&gt;<i> Why did Microsoft give up on OS X with Outlook Express?
</I>
Because there was no profit in it for Microsoft. There ain't no such 
thing as a free lunch.
