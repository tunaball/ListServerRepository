<PRE>Denise,

All hubs are not the same. My friend purchased two of them, one for his 
wife's PC, and one for his Mac. With one of them on his Mac he had the 
same problem as you except not with a mouse. He switched to the other 
one and the problem was resolved. His wife's computer worked with 
either, so he did not have to return it.

I would not give up on the mouse. Everyone has their preferences, but I 
will never own a non cordless mouse again. Do you know of anyone with a 
different hub you could try. I know that is annoying to do, but my 
friends and I swap hardware all the time to try to resolve our problems.

Guy
