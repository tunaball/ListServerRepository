Good luck.

  Can anyone tell me what these errors are as I can't get my Quicken 2001
  Deluxe to open because I get message &quot;application has unexpectedly quit
  because of type 3 error&quot; and sometimes says type 2 error.

  Type 1 and 2 errors

  Errors with a code of 1 or 2 are memory errors.  Type 1 are bus errors and
  type 2 are address errors.  Getting one of these errors means that the
  application is unable to address a segment of memory because that memory is
  either reserved for another use or doesn't exist.  This can also appear as a
  type -110 error.

  Possible Solutions

  1)  Allocate more memory.  At a minimum, you should use the preferred
  setting of memory for the application.  Quit the application, find its icon
  on the desktop, and press {apple} -I to bring up the Get Info box.  If you
  have any extra RAM, go ahead and allocate more than the suggested amount and
  see if that clears up the problem.

  2)  Delete an application's preference file.   If you are experiencing
  problems with one application and can't seem to find the cause or the
  solution, quit the application, and remove that application's Preferences
  file from the System Folder's Preference folder.  Afterwards, relaunch the
  application so it will start a new preferences file.  You will need to reset
  any settings or preferences you've changed while customizing the
  application.

  3)  Look for extension conflicts.  You can test for extension conflicts by
  the process of elimination.  (disable half of your extensions by dragging
  them out of the Extensions folder, then restart to see if the problem
  disappears; continue subdividing until you locate the problem extension).
  You can also use the same technique using the Extensions Manager.

  4)  Reinstall software.  If none of the previous steps have helped, try
  reinstalling the software.  Afterwards, remember to trash it preferences as
  directed in Step 2.  If you are still experiencing problems, try
  reinstalling your system software with the clean install option.

  5)  Check for viruses.  It is important to regularly run a virus-detection
  program on your Mac.  These programs can tell you if a virus is spotted on
  your computer and sometimes can repair the problem.

  Type 3 error -in next message(daemon problems)
