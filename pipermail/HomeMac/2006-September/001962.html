&gt;<i> 1. Do any of you have an Epson All-in-One with an LED screen?

</I>&gt;<i>    Does it have an LED screen?
</I>&gt;<i>    Have you had any problems with it?
</I>&gt;<i>    How is the scanning and photo printing?
</I>
Yes, Stylus CX5300, has a small LED display. About 2 years old. Have had the
ink pump replaced. Scanning and photo printing are excellent.

&gt;<i> 2. Epson or HP??????? I have been loyal to Epson since it is an Oregon company
</I>&gt;<i> and I live in a Portland suburb. But it may be time to switch.
</I>
Depends on what your priorities are. For me as an artist light fastness of
inks is crucial, and since Epson appears to be the one company that invests
a lot in this area, they are the only choice for me. However I have also
found their printers to be sturdy and long lasting. In addition to the 3 in
1 also have a photo 1200 A3 which is about 7 years or more old. It has
required a print head replaced but apart from that is going strong. The ink
light fastness is not as good as the CX5300 but the actual print quality is
higher.
 
&gt;<i> 3. If you have an All-in-One, what is it and would you recommend buying it?
</I>
Epson CX5300 Have found it surprisingly good considering the compromise
nature of a 3 in 1 and would happily recommend it. When I bought mine I
asked was it any good and the sales person showed me through the office
door, and there was their own office printer - a CX5300. I figured that was
a good enough recommendation for me. I have not been sorry. Epson support
over the phone has been excellent, and their technicians seem to be well
trained and competent.
