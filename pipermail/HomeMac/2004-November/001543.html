Retiree at this end too - ex teacher who has spent too much time since 
1982 mucking around with computers of all sorts, but a Mac evangelista 
since 1988.

That should be no problem; if you ever want to start up from the 10 Gb 
disk you select it in System Preferences &gt; Startup Disk.

And it's safer that way, I get to repair plenty of computers for folk 
who just thought they'd have a fiddle.  I know several people of our 
vintage who are still happily using old Macs or old PCs who have never 
felt the urge to &quot;fiddle&quot; and who have good reliable word processing, 
emailing and web browsing that suits them and avoids filling the 
pockets of Mr Gates and Mr Jobs.

</I>
As you have, most likely, suitable Apple RAM, an upgrade should go 
smoothly; but do make sure you back up your settings and documents.  I 
keep a (real) folder containing web passwords, my internet settings, 
software serial numbers, etc., I recommend the paper backup to all my 
clients.

&gt;<i>

Go to &lt;<A HREF="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/13260">http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/13260</A>&gt; for 
information and to download.

Brain backup - isn't that what we try to do when taking on the family 
history project?
