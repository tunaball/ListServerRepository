</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [HM] Can't open picture attachment
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A friend is trying to email me some pics as attachments, from his PC.  I
</I>&gt;<i> know I have been able to open his pics in the past, but it has been a while.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not recall changing any settings.  He is sending them as .jpg, which
</I>&gt;<i> normally open on my iBook with Pictureviewer.  They are 1K in size.  When I
</I>&gt;<i> click on the attachment in his email, nothing happens.  &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Save&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> options are grayed out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you help me search out what I may need to change?
</I>

 I got several helpful responses to my previous post regarding attachments.
However, I am still having trouble.  The friend mentioned in the above
original posting showed me the emails he sent when I was at his house, and
they each showed two or more picture attachments were sent from his computer
to mine.  What I received was a grayed out, single attchment which would not
open.  

I have since had two other people try to send me attachments, one picture
attachment and one .pdf, and in each case, nothing (not even a grayed out
attachment) came through.  Not even a paper clip on the message signalling
an attachment.  

I am using Outlook Express for Mac 5.0.5.  I have checked both &quot;Preferences&quot;
and &quot;Account Settings&quot; and can find nothing amiss.  I have also checked the
filter which my ISP uses (Postini).  I am at a loss.

Denise
