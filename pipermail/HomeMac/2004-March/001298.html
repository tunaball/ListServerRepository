<PRE>Debbi and Barry,

Debbi I am thrilled that my suggestions worked for you. And Barry thank 
you for the kind words. I learned the trick on disabling the USB during 
boot up by accident. When OSX first was released there was not a program 
that allowed you to boot up in X and actually run with a Finder. The 
author of the program &quot;Boot CD&quot; was able to figure out a way to do this 
before anyone else as far as I know. So I was following his instructions 
on burning a CD to do this, and was not able to get it to boot up for 
some reason.

Then one night while trying to sleep, I was kept awake by my CD burner 
which kept spinning for some reason. I got out of bed, pulled the plug, 
and also pulled out the USB connection. The next day on my first attempt 
to boot up with the useless CD from the day before it worked.

I instantly realized what was causing the problem, and a quick hook up 
of my burner proved that theory correct, when I was no longer able to 
boot up.

As for the IE problem, I was a member of the Unofficial Outlook Express 
website years ago, and the actual programmers of Outlook Express posted 
there. I learned from them that this also works with other Microsoft 
programs such as Outlook. If you use the same technique as I mentioned 
and run Outlook in place of IE, the Microsoft First Run will also launch 
and install these Extensions.
