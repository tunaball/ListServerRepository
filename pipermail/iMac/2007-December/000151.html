<PRE>We have satellite Internet access on our iMac here in my home office.  
It is with Telesat (Xplornet) in Canada (same as Wildblue in the US).  
I have one of the more expensive packages for SOHO use and it works  
very well and I seldom get dropped. I have an Ethernet cable strung  
between the Satellite modem and my computer which may account for the  
good connection, but I would think that a decent WiFi connection  
between the iMac and a wireless router should work as well. Perhaps if  
you were to get an add-on antenna or repeater to the router it would  
work better for you.
