I'm using one at this very minute. It's a beauty. I love the screen.
The speed bump isn't particularly noticeable to me for the things I do
(mostly email) but I have noticed that applications open a whole lot
faster. I have a gig of RAM. I do wish that I'd gotten the blue tooth
keyboard and mouse, though. I don't like seeing the wires. I opted not
to because I use a trackball and won't be using the Apple mouse
anyway. So, that's what it's like so far. And, oh, it's very light
weight. ;-D

<excerpt>Hi All,


I placed an order for an iMac G5 20" on 9/24. I was wondering if
anyone has one in hand yet and what are your initial impressions?
