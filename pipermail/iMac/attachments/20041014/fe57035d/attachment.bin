I had the G4 iMac, 800 MHz/768 Mb RAM. I have since noticed, though,
that it is ~much~ faster at processing digital film.

<excerpt>Addie,


You said the speed bump wasn't particularly noticeable to you, what
machine did you use before the new iMac?

<excerpt>I'm using one at this very minute. It's a beauty. I love the
screen. The speed bump isn't particularly noticeable to me for the
things I do (mostly email) but I have noticed that applications open a
whole lot faster. I have a gig of RAM. I do wish that I'd gotten the
blue tooth keyboard and mouse, though. I don't like seeing the wires.
I opted not to because I use a trackball and won't be using the Apple
mouse anyway. So, that's what it's like so far. And, oh, it's very
light weight. ;-D
