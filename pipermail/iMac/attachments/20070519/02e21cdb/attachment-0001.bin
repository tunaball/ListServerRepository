My last ISP sold to Suddenlink.net and I've spent a couple of hours
with their tech people trying to figure out why I was not getting
email from them...but was from my .mac account...and, for a temporary
solve, the tech set it up to forward to .mac.  Has anyone else had
this problem, and if so, how did you solve it?  All settings look fine
to both of us.  


TIA
