I have already sent it off to be repaired at a **very** reasonable rate.

Unfortunately Buy.com screwed up my order (they sent an SATA drive  
instead of an Ultra ATA drive, which is what their own receipt shows  
that I ordered).

Ralph Lewis (www.mac-care.com) contacted me after I posted to the  
list, and he has been very patient dealing with the Buy.com screwup  
(I didn't notice when the drive came that it was the wrong one, so I  
just sent it and the Powerbook to him!)

I once took apart a NeXT Laser Printer and replaced the fuser, which  
was not a task for the weak of heart.  I was able to do it, but my  
fingers are really not that adept.

Ralph's cost was, to me, cheaper than the time and frustration it  
would have taken me to do it :-)

(Replacing the hard drive in my MacBook was MUCH easier, that I could  
handle :-)
