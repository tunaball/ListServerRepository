<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> The screen on my 12&quot; Powerbook G4 seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to have become permanently dimmed. I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tried various System Preferences, including
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of course &quot;Monitors,&quot; but to no avail.
</I>
My 15&quot; PB G4's screen permanently dimmed awhile back.  Actually, it  
didn't go black, just was very dim.  By using the F1/F2 screen  
brightness keys I was able to push the screen brightness up high  
enough to see what was on it for a few seconds, maybe even click on  
something, and then the screen would go very dim.  If I clicked the  
F1 key to take the brightness back down to zero and then the F2 key  
to bring it back up, I could get back to dimly seeing what I was  
doing for a few seconds.

This problem started with a screen that would flicker occasionally  
before it went dim for good.  I was, however, able to connect the  
AlBook to an external monitor, and it worked fine,

I sent it to Apple (via AppleCare).  I told them about the problem on  
a Monday afternoon.  Tuesday afternoon the free shipping box was on  
my doorstep.  Wednesday afternoon I dropped it at DHL.  It shipped  
Thursday morning.  On Friday it was repaired.  It reappeared in my  
doorstep the following Tuesday.

They replaced the inverter that controls the backlight, which was the  
problem.

Works like a champ since.  Overall a good experience.  Lost no data,  
everything was the same.

Pete
