<PRE>Hello Ruqayya,

This might seem strange to you, but can you send me pictures of your tiBook?
Might you also send me the details of the sale on ebay--the page of the
auction, so I can check out the seller?  I had a 667 w/1 gig ram and an 80
gig hard drive stolen from me recently.  I am trying to track down any
leads.  I hope you can help.  As for the stripes, one of two problems.  A
connector which you can fix or a motherboard problem, which you can't.

Run - Seattle

</I>&gt;<i> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please help. I bought a used Titanium Powerbook G4 15&quot; 667 MHz with 1GB of ram
</I>&gt;<i> and an 80G hard drive running Tiger. It came loaded with software from ebay
</I>&gt;<i> with a 30day guarantee. I was ecstatic for the price. Worked great for the
</I>&gt;<i> first month I had it. One night I was working on it and the screen suddenly
</I>&gt;<i> zapped out to vertical stripes. I restarted it and it came back - but not for
</I>&gt;<i> long. It gets hot - sometimes enough to &quot;shock&quot; my wrist but I don't know if
</I>&gt;<i> this has anything to do with it. I can get it to come on for a few minutes at
</I>&gt;<i> a time but the least jarring movement will zap it out again. Sometimes it
</I>&gt;<i> works for a couple of hours then &quot;zap&quot;. It may get small fuzzy squares then it
</I>&gt;<i> goes to vertical stripes.But when it does come back with a clear screen the
</I>&gt;<i> data is intact and the image is clear.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought it was a problem with the connection between the screen and the
</I>&gt;<i> computer because I had a similar problem with my old G3 Wallstreet - which
</I>&gt;<i> still works great - and I just connected it to an external monitor with no
</I>&gt;<i> problems. But when I connected the G4 to an external monitor I got the same
</I>&gt;<i> vertical striped image. ??? I've seen on some lists that there is a loose plug
</I>&gt;<i> inside that can cause this problem but would it still affect an external
</I>&gt;<i> monitor? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I took it to the local Mac service station in Dakar. (I'm a teacher at a U.S.
</I>&gt;<i> school in Senegal in West Africa) I'm really not too confident in what the guy
</I>&gt;<i> told me. He said that it was a problem with the System software and wants to
</I>&gt;<i> dump my hard drive and do a clean install of the system. He said that there
</I>&gt;<i> were so many corrupted files (the guy I bought it from gave me a lot of free
</I>&gt;<i> stuff) that it was easier just to re-install. Now I'm not an expert - but I
</I>&gt;<i> know that a software problem wouldn't cause a machine to zap out if my 7-yr
</I>&gt;<i> old bumps the table. I ask myself why he didn't just use Techtools or Norton
</I>&gt;<i> or something? Plus - I really don't want to hand over my software cds and
</I>&gt;<i> dvds. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please advise. They're the only authorized Mac service station in Senegal.
