<PRE>On a Powerbook G4 1.67Mhz Alu on which I exchanged HD, I can't seem to  
get the left side to be snug enough so that I can't very easily lift  
it up a few mm with my fingernail, something that isn't the case on  
the right side where everything seems as it should. All screws are in  
place and properly tightened (not overly so).

I suppose the tongues in the top case or their holders could have been  
bent slightly when I took the case of? I did take care not to do that,  
but as I was pulling in the wrong direction &#8211; backwards &#8211; I suppose  
it's possible. It's not visible at least. I did have a surprisingly  
hard time getting the top case off. It seems straight up was the  
proper direction, but I really had to use force to make that happen. I  
did insert a screwdriverhead with a cloth over it and did wiggle a  
little, but I was afraid I'd damage the side metal so I was perhaps  
overly cautious.

I was thinking what the best way to make the fit snug again could be.  
Any ideas and/or experiences of your own on similar problems?

/MB
