By &quot;cooling&quot;, I mean HD's should be kept as cool as possible.  One of 
the few systems I've seen outside of high-end JBOD[1] boxes that have 
good cooling would be the G5 towers.  As a result, for the typical 
system it helps if you don't run it in to hot of a room (not always 
easy).

By &quot;hot&quot; I mean just that, HD's get hot, in fact besides the CPU, and 
Graphics card they're the main producers of heat in a computer.  Just 
how hot a drive gets depends on the model, and the rotational speed 
of the drive (the more RPM's the hotter the drive typically).

I put my Mac to sleep, largely to reduce the amount of heat in the 
room, but while it's awake I don't allow the drives to be powered 
down (standard energy savings step), as I don't think it is good for 
the drives.

Hopefully that's a bit more clearer, unfortunately I'm not that great 
at plain English.

[1] I can never remember what JBOD stands for, it's an external HD 
box, typically with fans that pull air from the front over the HD's. 
The disks themselves are in canisters, that can easily be removed 
from the box.  They're often rack mounted.
