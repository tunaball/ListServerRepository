Allume Software at the above URL is where stuffit comes from, the  
expander is free, the compression part is not. It's a bit of a roll  
and loop to get the free version download as they are trying to sell  
the whole package.  So as you  look around the site all roads seem to  
lead to buying it.
When you download the free expander it will also include a 30 day  
free trial of the StuffIt compression function. After 30 days only  
the Stuffit expander portion will work. However that is a vital  
portion to  opening downloads and what I believe you were asking about

The version that I have is 9.0.1 was the highest listed under X and  
they only posted as it working on 10.2 being the highest available. I  
downloaded it about 20 days ago and works fine on 10.4

Its actually a good deal as it's free and has been so for 15 years or  
more, so we have gotten spoiled a bit by no cost for the expander.  
The compression part, which does have a few good points I would buy  
it if the price were lower then $79.00 is pretty high. If the dropped  
it to $40 for both they might get my $$. However the could just say  
no more freebies on the expander and charge the 80 bucks. Of course  
it would probably PO most users and another company step in. So we  
should enjoy the last days of the wild west of the internet. Soon it  
will be like your TV, commercials all night long.
Hope it helps
