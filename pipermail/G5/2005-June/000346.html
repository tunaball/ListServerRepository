I feel your pain Brian.. I gave up on my BT mouse and I am also  
thinking that the BT keyboard although it doesnt have the start up  
issues (as often occa it too has to be screwed with to get it to  
&quot;take&quot; ) like the mouse
I do have trouble getting it to adjust to preferences.  It is  
maddening to have to continually correct my writing for doubled and  
tripled lettering and not be able to adjust it out
in the panel..  Also the new USB mouse I was sent is not nearly as  
well made as the one prev. either.  the detent for the clicking  
action is MUCH too free causing the mouse to randomly
click even with the slightest lifting and setting it back down like  
you would do if running off the side of the m pad.  Apple (very  
grudgingly) sent me another one -- it was the same.  Wish I had kept  
my old mouse.  BT would NOT work for me on the mouse.. I gave up upon  
its not working on either side of a total rebuild of the system.  
( another issue )  I could get it to work by running through a  
procedure ea time but whos gonna want to do that...  and now too ...  
I know it would be a two hour debockle to get APP to address the  
issue of compensation for the difference in price.. hardly worth it.
yea.. do I have a bit of an attitude with APP.. ?  uh huh! and they  
have earned it.. first level APP is very much like trying to take a  
banana from a hungry monkey.  This is a fairly recent development  
after many years (since '84) off satisfaction while using used  
Macs.-- I am seriously considering regressing to that scene again and  
getting away from the (b)leeding edge. Actually I would have stayed  
in that mantra  accepting having to make the leap into OS X ..  it s  
SO much easier on the pocket book AND blood pressure.  Computers by  
their very nature create social distance making PR a fast  
disappearing entity where only very mathematically gifted folks and  
the friends of .. can keep up.
