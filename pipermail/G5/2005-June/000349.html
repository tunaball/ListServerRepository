<PRE>I'm telling you guys, unplug the G5 before you restart and it WILL see 
the keyboard and mouse.  At least in 10.3.8.  I have to do that, and 
although it's a slight nuisance, it's not a bad one.  Until a tech at 
PC Connections told me that, it wouldn't SEE either one of them on 
start up.  Since I only start up about once a month, it's not a 
headache.  Hope this helps.
