<PRE>I am considering buying a G 5 tower, either a reman 2.5  which the  
price drop is phenomenal, I have seen some as much as 35% off, of  
course these probably have a year on them already, plus last for  
about 4 hours on the apple site, but Apple still backs them for 3  
with A.C.

A new  2.7 when I add all the extras, except RAM which I will not buy  
from Apple, the price hits 10Gs by the time I am done .

So, are you happy with the G5 towers or do you feel like it needs one  
more generation or so to mature, what are the bad points you have  
experienced, the good and surprising ones.

If you bought in the last 12 to  18 months do you feel like you  
should have waited as  you have something that already is starting to  
lag a bit or just keeping even with the video and photoshop work  
which is what I will be doing .

I know there is always something better and faster coming down the  
pipe, but for 10k I would like to get a good 4 years out of it.  How  
does it look for upgrading, are the processors  built and located so  
they can be easily be pumped by a 3rd party when the time comes. Or  
is it a tough or nearly impossible build

I prefer a laptop but a G4 P.B. 1.6 is just not worth almost 5 K when  
you add the upgrades  that you would want apple to cover and I need  
to get the job done I am stating.

  I have also read, coming soon to  the new Macs will not have any  
customer installable parts, so that will be a thing of the past.

It's not so much the money, I just want to get a machine that is  
going to be upgradable, not have major problems and not  loud.

I have basically been a lap top guy but those are mired in the mud  
for now, so time to look elsewhere

I have a Pismo  and 2 iBooks 1.2 all 3 have a gig of ram in them
Oh yes my trusty 6100 NEWER G3 300, 256 megs of ram, that has run  
from 1996 and still runs today, almost 24/7. I did have to replace  
the pram battery twice. This is the dependability and upgradable  
machine I need, even though it was PDS, considered crippled for  
upgrades, 9.1 runs fine.

How has Apple been with any repairs or problems that will not go  
away, if any

Thanks in Advance for any reviews.
Geoff
