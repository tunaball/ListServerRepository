I'm also very curious about the location of that heatsink. I would  
think that something like that would be covered in the Apple Service  
Manuals.

Did you mount the fans on the *inside* or outside of the G5's case?  
I've seen at least one picture of someone mounting an 80mm fan on the  
inside of the case near the memory housing (where I'd presume such a  
heatsink would live.)

I would also suggest that you post your problem and what you've  
learned to the G3-5 list. There are many experts on the list (moreso  
than myself) who might know exactly where that heatsink is. Good luck  
on taking it apart...

Eric
