Eric,

First off no offense was taken. Don't worry, I have been informed by  
Doctor friends of mine , that as we age , that happenings like that  
will increase more and more as we age.  : )     I, now, feel blessed  
if I can remember my own name, LOL.

Thank you for the external link to that site. I had not run across  
that site before. He does mention similar crashes, but due to the  
keywords, &quot;take apart&quot;, I had not seen that page. I have the Apple  
Service Source Manuals and had not searched for any manuals due to  
that.  After having seen his photos of the power supply, even tho mine  
has always lived in a clean lab environment and is immaculately clean,  
I am resolved to taking this one apart for a better look see. I will  
update you on what I find.

Yes, I had noticed the temperature reading on the  memory controller  
and had installed two standard pc type fans to the front of the case  
in the lower quadrant of the front panel that use an external power  
source. I noted that all fan RPMS ran at 300 rpms constant, with those  
two running full time. However the G5 still crashed at random anyway,  
whether idle or under critical load.

I also tried the fans on the rear of the G5, outside, located over the  
top of the existing fans. The result was a longer duration between the  
crashes, but still crashing at random.

I, too, am wanting to know where that heatsink is located.
