<PRE>Eric,
Sorry for the long time in getting back to you but I have been out of  
town for a while. Also, today is mine an my wife's 37th anniversary. I  
believe for our generation, it may be an all time record, LOL.

You hit the nail on the head . Your very astute observation, on the  
memory controller temps and its heat sink, got me to digging. I found  
it after having completely dismantling the G5. It is located on the  
back side of the Logic board / motherboard. it is held onto the logic  
board by 2 plastic push thru pins that kind of lock in place by  
grooves in the pins. Both pins were not locked into place and the heat  
sink was away from the controlled chip a fraction. Also, the thermal  
past had hardened by the heat build up as a result. Luckily, I was  
able to clean and replace the old thermal paste. The G5 is now rock  
solid running all of my many apps including the entire adobe suite and  
a host of other intensive apps at one time.


Many thanks to all who responded, but Eric gets the Gold Star award.


Again Eric, Many Thanks.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I had noticed the temperature reading on the  memory  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> controller and had installed two standard pc type fans to the front  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the case in the lower quadrant of the front panel that use an  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> external power source. I noted that all fan RPMS ran at 300 rpms  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constant, with those two running full time. However the G5 still  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crashed at random anyway, whether idle or under critical load.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also tried the fans on the rear of the G5, outside, located over  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the top of the existing fans. The result was a longer duration  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between the crashes, but still crashing at random.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I, too, am wanting to know where that heatsink is located.

</I>&gt;<i>
