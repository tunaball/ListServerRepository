Hello


I understand you, Apple could had run software update before to send
you your new G5


Apple if you are reading the list please do so, it does not cost much
and it will be so much more professional


Apple could also make a utility to create a "system backup" on a CD
so, in case of problem after you have re-install you do not have to
download all the updates.
