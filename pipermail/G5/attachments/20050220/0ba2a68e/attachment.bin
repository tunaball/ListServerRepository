<excerpt>Just got a new dual 2.0 G5.  I plan to clone my G4/867 master
drive to the G5 hard drive using this 10 step process:


1. Repair permissions/update directory on the G4 with DiskWarrior

2. Put original G5 system restore disk into CD/DVD drive

3. Connect both macs via firewire

4. Boot the G5 into target mode

5. Reformat the G5 drive with Disk Utility

6. Clone the G4 hard drive with Carbon Copy Cloner

7. Shutdown the G5, remove firewire cable

8. Reboot the G5 from the system restore DVD

9. Install the OSX operating system using Archive and Install

10.  Pray like hell

You can pray !


I do not think it is a good idea to have a G4 system on a G5.

You better call Apple support to check for this.


I have heard of a utility in the Apple software to move from one
system to another !

If my memory is good, when you start your G5 for the 1st time it will
ask you if you want to copy data from another computer, but you need
to have both computer on a network


Trying CCC, I have prefer Personal Backup ; more relyable, it's a bit
more expensive but you have a company and support behind


If I was you I will partition my HD.

- One volume for system

- One volume for swap files (you need a utility to move them)

- One volume for data that you read only

- one and more volume for data where you update<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param>


A FW disk is a good idea for backup and cloning !


</fontfamily>As soon you have a problem in it's first year get an
Apple care for your G5<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param>
