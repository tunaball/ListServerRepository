Empty Safari Cache

Clear History

Trash safari icons (Library/Safari/Icons)

Go to your utilities folder/java there is an icon that reads "Java
1.4.2 Plugin Settings" and another that reads "Java 1.3.1 Plugin
Settings" double click on them. A window will pop up
with"general/cache/certificates" click on the "cache" and click on the
clear button. Do this for both java settings. Repair per missions and
I woudl restart.


You can also use a utility to do the cleaning. Search versiontracker
for onyx or macjanitor

<excerpt>Lately I can't seem to bookmark anything on Safari.  When I
try, I get the spinning beachball forever and I can't do anything with
Safari, except "Force Quit".  I'm running 10.3.7 on a dual 2.5 G5. 
Anyone have any suggestions or ideas why?
