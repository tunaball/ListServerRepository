Does anyone partition their hard drive any more?  I used to with OS 9.

I was wondering, since I have such a large drive, if I should

partition it.  I didn't think OS X really needed or liked partitioning.

That sounds like the same partitioning scheme I used with OS 9.  I
thought

that OS X prefers to have all applications in the Applications folder
on

the boot volume.  That's why I was considering NOT partitioning either
of

my 250GB drives.


Now if I can figure out how to have my iPhoto library and pics on my
web

and media server I'll be very happy.  Or maybe I'll just switch from
iPhoto

to Portfolio.  At least Portfolio will tell me which CD or DVD a
certain

picture is on.  If only iPhoto did that...


Thanks,
