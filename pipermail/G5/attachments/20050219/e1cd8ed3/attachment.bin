Now if I can figure out how to have my iPhoto library and pics on my
web

and media server I'll be very happy.  Or maybe I'll just switch from
iPhoto

to Portfolio.  At least Portfolio will tell me which CD or DVD a
certain

picture is on.  If only iPhoto did that...

It's easy.


in your user directory you have a picture folder ; in this folder you
have   Iphoto library, move it to another drive 

make an alias and place it back in your Photo directory suppress
"alias" from the name of "Iphoto library"
