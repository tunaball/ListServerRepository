None that I've found since '94.


I use Mac Connection/PC Connection and like them a lot.

<excerpt>Hi,

 

Is it really true that there are no viruses on the Apples?  Sorry, I
crossed to the darkside and bought a Sony -- and the viruses and other
stuff is overwhelming.

 

Also, several yrs ago, I used Mac/PCWarehouse -- but they're gone. 
Any recs outside of MacMall?  My Dad is located in CA. 

 

Thanks!

 

Lela
