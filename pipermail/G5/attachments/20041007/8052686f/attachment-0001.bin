Hi!

My 1.8DP G5 is soon running out of disk space.


What do you recommend for update, Maxtor, Seagate or something else
(SCSI maybe) ? Aiming for 160-200GB disk.


Personally I went for a 1Tb LaCie (which I understand is now
superceded buy a 1.6Tb drive) running FireWire 800.


Its great for iTunes library (shared via air tunes), video work and
backup.

Be carefull, Apple does not support booting on a FW 800 disk, I was
doing this and I had two major crash with OS X (obliged to reformat to
zero)

</fixed>

<fixed>Now I am looking at solutions like Firmtek G5jam ....


By the way what is the fastest SATA disk available ?
