Presumingly averige seek time is what gives the most of the speed
issues, but I see that mentioned 16 meg buffer size quite significant.
I just happened to install new 2,5" 60 Gb Toshiba into my Powerbook
and it has 16 meg buffer chipset. Noticed some speed increase, and
putting weight on "some" ; )

Could it be Seagate SATA models, perhaps.?
