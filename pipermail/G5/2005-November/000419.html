<PRE>A 56 MB is awful low, there is the approximately 95 MB in the stand  
alone updater, The combo hits about 107 to 110, check the apple web  
site for the exact size. Lots of interesting stories on the  
discussions, which is a very good place to get answers most of the  
time. Also remember it's just an update, I usually wait a couple of  
weeks to see what is good or bad

On the G5 fans, what level of tech support where you at ,if you were  
at level 1 STOP and call back and ask to speak to a
level 2 customer service rep. The level one guys read from a list,  
when the list runs out, so does their knowledge, they just try to get  
rid of you.  Telling you to clean everything out and go back to tiger  
is not good info, except in some cases you may have to do. Say you  
bought this as a refurb. If it's your computer  and things  been  
going smoothly for 6 months on 10.4 . I would not do that, just for a  
update.. This is not a whole new system, just a update.  The level 1  
guys will also tell you all the answers are at the mac info page,  
well I am sure you looked there, they can be very rude, you never  
know what country your calling.

Get a level 2 tech and your answer will be there in 2 minutes, the  
level 1 guys can be rude, just hold to your right under Apple Care to  
speak to someone more knowledgeable. In the couple of times I have  
had to use it, the level 2 guy understood Macs and answered my  
question in 2 minutes. This after 30 minutes of of wasting time on  
level 1.
