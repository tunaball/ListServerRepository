<PRE>My suggestion: Buy a 17&quot; iMac G5. It is light enough to mount on an 
extension wallmount and you can control everything with either 
Bluetooth or a Logitech cordless.

I, too, have been using PowerBooks in place of desktops and just this 
year switched back. The new iMacs are stunning examples of Apple's 
continued ability to blaze new trails in industrial design. As an added 
bonus, they have made nearly everything user-serviceable. My techie 
claims that a user could easily change the logicboard! (No, I won't try 
it...)

BTW, I am somewhat handicapped myself and cannot sit at a conventional 
desk for more than 30 minutes. This new set-up suits me just fine. Of 
course, I went with the 20&quot; which makes it a wee bit more intricate to 
mount it on a wall but the screen is so bright and precise that I can 
see whatever I need to from a prone position. And catching a movie 
occasionally on that large monitor is the icing on the cake!

</I>&gt;<i> check the weight of the monitors but hoping this might work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know a powerbook fits my needs better but they are starting to 
</I>&gt;<i> really lag way behind the G5 with not much more power expected on the 
</I>&gt;<i> horizon, or over it for that matter. I have always liked that you can 
</I>&gt;<i> keep the towers going with inexpensive upgrades
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want the power to do video editing and the fellow who said &quot;I
