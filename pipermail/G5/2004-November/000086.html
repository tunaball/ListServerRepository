<PRE>Glad to see the list is alive. I have been using powerbooks up to the 
Pismo. It seemed every Power book after that,  came was a bit faster 
but had some problems that I would not expect from Apple.

I like the G 5 the technology, Apple has seemed to work out the bugs. 
The problem I have is how far can the cable run from the tower to the 
monitor. Due to back surgeries it is very hard to sit up in a chair, 
hence the need for Power Books.

I have seen a cart that the G5 fits into securely and has wheels, so I 
could move it around the home, that puppy weighs 40 pounds! Thats a lot 
for a book user, amazing how shrink wrap those machines down to around 
6 pounds .
So moving the G5 is not be a problem, the monitor is a different story.

How long can the cable be from the tower to the screen, are their any 
wireless monitor solutions? The big problem is most of my time is spent 
in a reclined position; thanks to these worthless DUI enforcement and 
lack of jail time for any offender. Sorry for the rant but when a 21 
year old has 17 DUIs and he is still driving, and hits me head on 
that's wrong, even though he was not drunk at the time and was out of 
the state for 2 months where he had the DUI's. At 38 my life is over. 
As a medivac pilot I saw so many drunks kill or maim people and nothing 
happens to the drunk, too loosened up from the alcohol yelling and 
screaming to get these hand cuffs off.

So where was I, sorry, keyboards are wireless, airport wireless 
internet  put a table close by and I could put up the monitor so I 
could see what's happening, although not being a speed typer probably 
need a good sized monitor as I like to see what I am typing. I did not 
check the weight of the monitors but hoping this might work.

I know a powerbook fits my needs better but they are starting to really 
lag way behind the G5 with not much more power expected on the horizon, 
or over it for that matter. I have always liked that you can keep the 
towers going with inexpensive upgrades

I want the power to do video editing and the fellow who said &quot;I 
probably got to big of a machine&quot; smart move. Your going to be able to 
keep with technology from Apple for a long time, I think that is a why 
I am trying to move from a lap top to a tower as the technology is not 
keeping up. Plus the money they want for a power book is probably twice 
the cost and half the performance.
Appreciate any thoughts or ideas and enjoy those 5's
Thanks
Geoff
