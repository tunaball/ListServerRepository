OK, now this is really cool. When receiving a message that is too
large most mailing list servers will just reject the message sending
an error back to the person sending it.


Mailman in this case, did 2 things. First it sent a message back to
the person sending it saying that the message is being held because it
was too large, and offered a link that would cancel the message. It
also sent a message to the list owner letting them know that a message
is being held because it was too large offering them the choice of
letting the message through to the list or rejecting it.


Pretty cool stuff. (That is if you get excited about this kind of
stuff...)
