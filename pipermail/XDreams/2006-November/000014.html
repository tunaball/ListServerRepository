<PRE>Lela,

Let me try and sort through the confusion and clarify issues (at 
least as I understand you are tying to ask about).

The latest Macs (indeed any new Mac model that you now buy) are 
powered by an Intel chip. This along with appropriate software, one 
of which &quot;Boot Camp&quot; is currently in Beta (pre production) but will 
come with OS X 10.5, will let you run both Windows (as long as you 
own a copy) and OS X on a given Intel powered Mac.

This perhaps covers &quot;the new &quot;dream&quot; operating system -- which I 
thought (am I wrong?) which allows the user to use both OS and 
Windows.&quot;

That being said, I don't believe, as James has said, that there are 
any projectors that are &quot;Windows Only&quot;. Almost all projectors I have 
used or helped clients use, supported whatever machine was connected 
to it.

The issue though is achieving the connection.

Many projectors still use &quot;VGA&quot; as a standard connection (15 pins 
arranged in three rows of five). On a projector these are usually 
&quot;female&quot; (as in the 15 connections are recessed) and rely on a cable 
with 15 pins (commonly referred to as a &quot;male&quot; connection).

The current MacBook Pro's have a different standard connection 
(&quot;DVI&quot;) and the entry level machines have a slightly different 
connection (&quot;Mini DVI&quot;).

The MacBook Pros come with a DVI to VGA adapter cable when purchased 
and the MacBooks have a Mini DVI to VGA adapter cable available as an 
accessory. Both cables are fairly short 15cm (or about 6&quot;) and you 
probably need an extension cable (male VGA at one end and female VGA 
at the other) to connect the two - if  you want some distance between 
the projector and the MacBook / MacBook Pro.

Now if the projector (like some new flat screen TV's) has a DVI 
connection, then things get a bit simpler in that you don't need 
adapter cables and you can use a single straight cable to join the 
two.

The main issue is to find out what connection your proposed projector 
requires and how to achieve this from your Mac.

You should find the operating system used on the computer has little 
or nothing to do with the issue.

Hope that helps.

Sorry about lack of context but previous thread &quot;snipped&quot; to get 
under list length limitations. :(
