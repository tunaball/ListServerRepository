I have one, it's great. My advice, for what it sounds like you are  
going to be doing, max out the RAM and go for a larger HD.

</I>
For the digital camera, USB connection is fine. For the camcorder,  
make CERTAIN that it has FireWire connectivity.

</I>&gt;<i> other people's equipment which were typically PC-based.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, as u know, PC parts and accessories are readily available.

</I>
Apple's own 'Boot Camp' is at this point Beta software but will  
apparently be integrated into Leopard.
&gt;<i> (hmmm, is there cause for worry?) -- there's the bootcamp download  
</I>&gt;<i> and the optional software &quot;parallel.&quot;
</I>
Parallels, in my view, is a better option that Boot Camp in it's  
present state. Boot Camp allows/forces you to pick which OS you wish  
to use at startup. To switch from one to the other requires a restart  
of the computer. Parallels will run multiple OS'es simultaneously. It  
works VERY well.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, anyone's experience on working with a bunch of PC's since it's  
</I>&gt;<i> been awhile since I had to do it.
</I>
We all, as Mac users, 'work with a bunch of PC's', for the most part  
with no problems. Having said that, I can cite instances of software  
available ONLY for PC's, thereby rendering the Mac 'useless', but at  
the same time can name software available only for the Mac, rendering  
the PC 'useless'. On the other hand, I have never seen Apple  
computers that could not play nicely with each other. I HAVE,  
however, seen several instances where 'identical' PC's simply could  
not read files created by each other. In several of those instances I  
have acted as the 'go between'. Harkening back to the floppy days, PC  
1 would save a Word document to a floppy, I would open it on my Mac  
using MacLink Plus and AppleWorks (not having Word on my computer),  
save it as a renamed Word document back to a new floppy (which I  
formatted for PC on my Mac), provided that floppy to PC 2 and TA DA!  
PC 2 was now able to read the floppy AND the document. Even today  
I've still done the same thing for PC pals, the difference being that  
the files no longer travel via floppy.

&gt;<i>   Thus, should I wait a bit longer or is it safe to get the Apple now?
</I>
It is always safe to get an Apple. Of course, there is always 'the  
next upgrade' just around the corner and some folks wait forever.

Buy a Mac.
