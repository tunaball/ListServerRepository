Different Mark, but possibly the same information.

1. Please read the post / email that I sent you on the 6th of this 
month outlining connection options.

2. The 13&quot; MacBook does not come with any adapters for external 
projectors. You will need to by either:

a. A mini DVI to VGA adapter

or

b. A mini DVI to DVI adapter depending of what you need to hook up 
to. If you are unsure, buy both (they are AUD$35 each so I'm guessing 
USD$20 or so).

3. The 15&quot; and 17&quot; MacBook Pro's do come with DVI output built in and 
DVI to VGA adapter as part of the machine bundle so you don't need to 
buy anything extra.

4. As for Windows on Mac. Its not an &quot;OS-Windows&quot;. The new Intel chip 
allows the machine to run Windows as well as OS X (Windows is not 
somehow built into OS X). A bit like a multi format TV that can be 
tuned to NTSC or PAL. There are currently two main options. Boot Camp 
(currently in beta but will be part of 10.5) or via applications such 
as CrossOver or Parallels.

Boot Camp provides the best compatibility and speed but you have to 
start the Mac as a Windows machine.

CrossOver or Parallels provides the best convenience as they are 
applications (like Word, etc.) that run in OS X - no reboot required 
but you can run into performance (slower) and compatibility (graphic 
cards, etc.) issues.

Either option requires a full copy of Windows XP to work (i.e. you 
have to buy a copy).
