<PRE>Doug,

I just joined the list. Though it seems there's not
much going on here, this particular thread is exactly
what I need.

Have you tried using their USB cable in OS 9? Maybe
the drivers I'm using would be helpful. 

I have a G3 Wallstreet Powerbook, running OS 9.2.2,
Belkin UBS adapter card and Earthmate receiver with
deLorme's serial-to-USB adapter and Street Atlas 6.0,
no difficulty. 

That's a good set-up. Problem is, I've lost the data
CD. I still have the install disc. You seem to have
the data disc. Is there any way I could persuade you
to burn me a copy? I've tried to get one from deLorme
and they were not only unhelpful, they were downright
arrogant about it - &quot;It's not worth our time to
support Mac, we dumped all our Mac files when we
updated our servers, etc.&quot; They even tossed all their
copies of 6.0 in the trash.

Please let me know if you can help. I'll pay for any
costs involved, including overnight shipping! I'm
getting ready for some long-distance travels.

Thanks,

BTW, I've read some very bad reviews of Route 66, so
be warned!!!

</I>Jeff, I have a firewire pb I got in 2000. Have been
using Delorme 
Streetatlas 6.0. They said I could not use their USB.
They sent me a 
serial gps, had to buy a keyspan converter and their
12v power cord, so 
I would not have to keep buying AAA batterys. The
problem is that 
Delorme has quit supporting Macs. I am still looking
to get something 
for a friend. So far I have found several sites for
USB drivers and 
receivers by using Google ( mac gps software). My
friend hasn't done any 
thing yet so I can't help you there. You might look at
Route 66 map 
software. I am not sure it is as smooth as this
streetatlas is. I tryed 
to get my son in Mobile to buy the window version of
Street Atlas so I 
could try their USB with those drivers. i will keep
this post and if I 
find out any thing I will let you know.

 

</PRE>
