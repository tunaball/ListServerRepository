Flipper expounds on why the Dock is a hack:
&gt;<i> It's a 'hack', because a DEVELOPER, who pays money to Apple, to have 
</I>&gt;<i> access to the APIs and system code necessary to develop apps and 
</I>&gt;<i> little apps (utilities) for the Macintosh (which Jobs bragged in SF 
</I>&gt;<i> had &quot;over 300,000 developers SUPPORTING the Macintosh platform), wrote 
</I>&gt;<i> an app that slightly changes the appearance of the GUI. Big deal.
</I>
Well if it's built in to the system, I don't think people think of it 
as a hack. Now something like Labels X is a hack, because it is an 
afterthought, not installed by the Mac system. What defines a hack to 
some is simply something that is not installed by the system, but that 
alters the system.

&gt;<i> Photoshop is a 'hack', also.
</I>
But it's clearly a separate application. So according to you, all 
applications are hacks?

&gt;<i> I expect to see a 'transparency' feature in the Dock, at some point. 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe once Jobs realizes that the brushed aluminum Finder in Panther 
</I>&gt;<i> is a resounding failure and lets the people (at Apple) engineering the 
</I>&gt;<i> GUI have a go. Nobody (even the sycophants) likes it.
</I>
I hate brushed aluminum and the colored dots in the wrong place. I 
loved the design of the Classic windows and the placement of the 
buttons and thought that was change for the sake of change only. But I 
thought the Dock was already transparent. When another window goes 
under it, I can still see it. What is your conception of transparent?

&gt;<i> My original comments, despite the defensive reaction of a few, were 
</I>&gt;<i> not 'directed' at anyone. I agree, AND occasionally disagree, with 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone, sooner or later. Again, so what? What is it, a package deal 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;love me, love all my opinions!!&quot;?.I hope not.
</I>
Nope never. But I am still stumped as to why the seemingly already 
transparent Dock is considered a hack.

&gt;<i> My girlfriend is on the verge of buying her first Mac, ever, due to my 
</I>&gt;<i> incessant proselytizing on behalf of Apple.
</I>
Well isn't that nice! And she has automatic support, how lucky for her. 
I've converted a few in my day.

&gt;<i> Apple didn't get where they are by listening to those who agree with 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever makes it out the door. They want feedback (and praise, and 
</I>&gt;<i> why not), they want developers, and they need to know what is and  
</I>&gt;<i> isn't working for us, the users, too.
</I>
I agree, but I and others have had many board posts removed by Apple 
when we pointed out shortcomings that needed attention...Apple doesn't 
seem to like public criticism.
