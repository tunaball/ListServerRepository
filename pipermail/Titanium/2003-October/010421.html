I would suggest reading the software agreement that most of us click 
&quot;I agree&quot; to when we update or install software.

Besides, what is it about modern culture that makes us want to jump 
into a lawsuit at the drop of a hat?  Sorry if this offends you 
lawyers, but that is the lamest attempt to resolve an issue; in fact, 
it resolves nothing, rather it deepens the rift and the next product 
you buy will have your cash and the attorney's fees built into it.

If you want to force a company to change their practices, don't buy 
their products.  It's simple, it works. Always. Apple is a billion 
dollar company that will stand up and take notice if their loyal 
following says, hey, you are not going to get my $129 for Panther, my 
$99 for dotMac until you change the way you are doing things.

But we won't. Or at least not enough of us. Why is Apple still not 
offering an upgrade path for their OS... a little &quot;give back&quot; for us 
bleeding-edge early adopters? Because they don't have to.  Enough of 
us shelled out the money for Jaguar that they feel comfortable 
charging full price for Panther as well.  As much as I railed on this 
list and others about the full price upgrade, I was only able to hold 
out for about 3 months (then I won a copy at an Apple Seminar).

Corporate world does not give us what we want, they give us what we 
will tolerate. We tolerate buggy, flakey and incomplete software as a 
whole. Not just in the OS, but Adobe hasn't produced a workable 
version of Illustrator for over 4 years, but we still buy it because 
the alternatives are also crappy and often require a learning curve 
that is more of a pain than the buggy crap they call software.  If 
you walk into a car dealer and look at a brand new vehicle with wires 
still hanging out of the dash instead of instruments, would you 
accept the salesmen telling you that they were still working on it, 
but it will be complete before you have to buy another car? Or would 
you buy a refrigerator that would, once in a while, blow the circuit 
breaker in your house when you opened the door? If the masses would 
tolerate those things we would surely have corporations producing 
such.

Microsloth takes the biggest hit and deservedly so, but we are to 
blame because we accept it; we vent on lists like this, but we still 
shell out our cash. If you really believe in what you are saying 
above, then DO, don't SUE. Organize a boycott of Panther.

Apple's numbers are hurting, I am pretty sure, because they are not 
talking about them... they sure tout the numbers when they are good; 
I am willing to bet that dotMac re-subscribes and Panther pre-orders 
are slim, else we would be hearing numbers. A well-orchestrated 
Panther boycott may get you a voice with Steve Jobs himself.
