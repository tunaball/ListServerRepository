There is no doubt that AOL makes it very easy to get online and start using
their service. 10 years ago I had no trouble recommending AOL because they
were just about the only online service that made it easy. In addition, AOL
had some truly premium advantages over other online services.

But today nearly every ISP has an easy to use installer that configures the
computer and gets you up and running in no time. What AOL does today is
provide an inferior product at a higher than average price while providing
almost no extra value for the premium. So yes, AOL is easy. But so are other
online services, many of which provide better service, better support, and a
lower price.

Like many others, I found AOL quite difficult to drop. Since I have a severe
hearing deficit and hate using the phone, I faxed my cancellation. Three
weeks later, assuming I'd long ago been cancelled, I received a letter from
AOL informing me that my REQUEST was denied because I'd left out important
information. For my convenience, since the cancellation request couldn't be
verified, I was still an AOL member. Interesting that, I had followed the
instructions to the letter! So I faxed another cancellation providing the
additional information the letter indicated I needed to provide. I received
a phone call the next day with an offer to stay on AOL for 3 months at half
price. I refused. It was upped to 6 months at half price and then to 9
months. I impolitely told the representative that I wanted nothing to do
with AOL. So I was cancelled. And billed for that extra month it took the
company to tell me they hadn't cancelled my account. It took me 4 months of
fighting to get that last charge removed.

I recommend AOL to no one today and based on its shoddy business practices,
I strongly urge those who do use it to look elsewhere for internet access.

One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them
One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
