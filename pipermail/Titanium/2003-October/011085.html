All I can say is that I lost a lot of time due to Panther.

I was astounded that in a few days of doing nothing unusual I was messed up by so many things, that had become a part of my habits, changing. This is not user friendly. Some buttons that were defaults before no longer were. Icons shifted all over. I never could get my sticky notes to open at the top of my screen, where I kept some of them. I was off email for a few days because my Eudora could not send with Panther. It took me that long to find time to transfer my Eudora folder to another machine running Jaguar, which is where I am now. I printed over and over to multiple printers and lost all of it, eventually deleting my printers and re-creating them. This is not plug-n-play and is not user friendly. My mother would never have found any solutions to these things.

The only thing I liked was the command-tab app switching (MacOS was better than the dock for this, in my opinion). But I was disappointed to hear that this good things was copied off of Windows. I do remember it being a part of Office once, and was a favorite method of mine back then.

I can't add a lot because I never tried to run any apps, other than iChat (maybe) and Eudora and a couple of others with Panther. IE was crashing a lot but at least I finally found how to get my bookmarks to Safari (by using Tinker Tool) on my retreat to Jaguar. I won't mention how many of my sites have failed me with Safari so far.

Today at a ribbon cutting for a Carnegie Mellon campus it was asked how many think software works. Not a hand went up.
