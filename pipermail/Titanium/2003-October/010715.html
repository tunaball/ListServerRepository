<PRE>As has been reported by a number of us in the past, on my 17&quot; Big Al I lose the AirPort network occasionally. The signal strength goes to zero and the network itself disappears from the AirPort menu. Nothing I've tried has worked other than restarting.

Today I was setting up a brand new Big Al. I had upgraded to OS X 10.2.8 but I had this problem before and after that OS revision on my prior Big Al. I had only installed only a few apps and the only one that might play with the system was Stuffit Deluxe  8.0.

On the brand new computer the problem arose again. I tried a few things like turning the AirPort on and off, going to sleep and waking up, etc. I checked the system profiler and the data for the AirPort card was the same as before. Only a restart cured the problem.

I use Apple AirPort Base Stations at home and at work. The problem occurs at both sites.

On a related note, I now have to restart my PowerBook every day or two for various problems, this being one of them. Usually some app just stops behaving correctly or loses some functionality, and a restart clears things up. I suspect that apps like IE and Eudora don't like 'too much' use in one session, but that's just a guess. Anyway, this restarting is getting annoying.

I was one of the ones not using IE in MacOS 9 and would go a week or two between restarts.
