When I studied computers in college, it involved learning how to keypunch to enter data.    That was long ago.  I'm just the ordinary Mac user.  I'm not trying to tell any expert what to do or think.  I'm simply trying to point out to people that AOL is capable of doing things that  people are claiming is not possible.

Actually, AOL does some things so well that it's very difficult to pry people off of it, even when they should leave. I'm thinking of former students who adopted AOL in class 10 years ago but now are in college. If what you want is something simple that works, it's hard to beat AOL.

One could say that the AirPort Base Station is not as good as other wireless routers. It doesn't have an ethernet hub built in. It has lower range. An outsider could certainly call it Junk. But the ABS has a modem and others don't. If you are an average Joe who wants to connect via modem and share via wi-fi, and have minimal complexity in doing it, the ABS is hard to beat.

But really, we stick with AOL and with Macintoshes (and products like the ABS) because it's hard to leave what you are used to, as long as it works. The answer is not a logical quantitative analysis of benefits and problems.
