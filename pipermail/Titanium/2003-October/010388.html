</I>&gt;<i> century Finder, for starters.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For one thing, with all due respect, we have to realize that

Thank you, Flipper - couldn't have said it better myself!

You hit the nail right on the head.

The sad part (Shawn, Massimo, Michael Bigley and others of the
cheerleading squad) is that you are doing Apple great harm with your
&quot;Apple can do no wrong/it's your fault anyway/caveat emptor/go to Windows
if you don't like it...etc&quot; and all those other pearls of &quot;wisdom/sarcasm&quot;
approach!

I say to the UNbiased members of this list - don't let them get away with
it! Raise your voice too, and be heard...for US and a BETTER Apple.

Best,

Henry
