<PRE>On Wed, Oct 01, 2003, Sherman Gregory <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">sherman at qualcomm.com</A>, invoked
powers within the internet realm, to proclaim ...

&gt;<i>I got my Al 15&quot; back already, and is seems to be fine now.  I dropped 
</I>&gt;<i>it off at the Apple Store Sunday afternoon, It arrived at my office 
</I>&gt;<i>around 10:00 this morning (Wednesday).  That is pretty impressive. I 
</I>&gt;<i>am in California, and it was shipped from Texas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The repair order said they &quot;performed alignment/adjustment&quot;.  seems 
</I>&gt;<i>like something the local Apple store should have been able to do.
</I>
Hey Sherman,

I know you must be feeling greatly relieved that it did not take the 10
days you were quoted to get your Al back. I was impressed with the turn-
around time for my PowerBook repair. Glad to hear that all is well. (The
only bad note I had from my experience is that all my preferences were
very very off and it took me a few days to realize that the part I was
told was replaced was something major. The tech said logic board, but the
repair gave it some obtuse name and number, which I never investigated.)

Yes. One would think that alignments would be fixed before leaving the
factory - but a misalignment could have happened in transit. I'm glad,
for your sake, that it didn't turn out to be a bigger ordeal or longer
separation. The only consolation I could find was to immerse myself in a
few movies I rented.
