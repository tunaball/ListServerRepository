Seems a bit Chicken Little-ish to me.

I switched to the Mac last year.  I don't recall then or now thinking 
of iTunes as THE Mac-only application.  Sure, its a great media player, 
but it isn't driving people to the Mac.  I'm not sure iMovie or iDVD 
are either - but they have alot more going for them as far as being 
truly outstanding and unique than iTunes does.

So what would you rather Apple do?  Keep hamstringing iPod for Windows 
by forcing the poor Winbloze users to use that crappy MusicMatch 
garbage with it?  Or maybe they shouldn't have even released iPod for 
Windows?

Yeah, that's the ticket - have Apple stick its head back in the sand as 
it did years ago - then maybe we can drop from 3% market share to 1% - 
or even less.

My officemate is a windows user.  He downloaded iTunes today and, aside 
from a couple of technical glitches, was incredibly impressed with it - 
including the ability to listen to my music over the network.  iTunes 
for Windows is a good thing - the more money Apple can extract from the 
other 97% of the market, the better.
