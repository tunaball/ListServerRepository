<PRE>The pin and clutch are intact, if slightly bent: The break follows the 
line of the screen long the cup where the pin sits. It has sheared off 
from the 'L' shaped bracket which surrounds the lower corner of the 
screen assembly. I have trawled as much information from the web as I 
could find, including a Norwegian user who actually X-Rayed his TiBook 
to see how it worked!

Sounds to me like a non-starter. Makes the Subject more apt. My worst 
fears about cemented parts are true and it probably would end in a pile 
of scrap and a lost friend.

But the woods look so pretty, all the little flowers, is that a 
bunny?...

</I>&gt;<i> (which senses when the computer is closed), the hinges, the associated 
</I>&gt;<i> cables for those parts, the titanium case around it all, and the white 
</I>&gt;<i> carbon fiber part at the bottom of the display).  If any part of that 
</I>&gt;<i> is broken, the only thing we can do is replace the whole unit.  Unless 
</I>&gt;<i> you can find one of the extremely rare places that can replace the 
</I>&gt;<i> display without sending it to Apple, (the shop I work at is one place, 
</I>&gt;<i> but it's not open to the public) you're going to have to pay the 
</I>&gt;<i> flat-rate $1300 for accidental damage including the display to get 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple to replace it.
</I>&gt;<i> The only other option would be to find a broken computer on eBay or 
</I>&gt;<i> pbparts.com with a working display; you'll need either the 867 or 1 
</I>&gt;<i> GHz display.  Replacing the whole display isn't too difficult, and you 
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to find instructions on how to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> Another option is to use an external display, and just leave the 
</I>&gt;<i> computer in one place all the time as a desktop to avoid further 
</I>&gt;<i> damage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, theoretically, you *could* open the display assembly.  However, 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to very, very strongly recommend against it.  It's not a 
</I>&gt;<i> nice thing to do, and the case is glued shut there.  I wouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> attempt it myself, and I've done complete disassembly of just about 
</I>&gt;<i> every laptop since the PowerBook G3 and iBook many, many times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now is when you decide whether to sell your friend's daughter into 
</I>&gt;<i> slavery, or if he can live without a PowerBook.
</I>&gt;<i> But just think, several years from now, he can tell his daughter how 
</I>&gt;<i> she cost him $1300 when she was 3 years old, so there's NO way she's 
</I>&gt;<i> getting a car for her 16th birthday, especially considering what that 
</I>&gt;<i> $1300 will be worth in 13 more years.  ;-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are fairly accessible but I have had warnings from several quarters 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to attempt the disassembly of the lid, at least without a technical
