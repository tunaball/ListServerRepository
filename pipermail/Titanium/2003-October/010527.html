<PRE>I'm aware of what it takes to liven AppleCare.  I was at the
AStore because I'd just discovered we'd bought the server
unit 3 days short of 1 year ago and didn't want to risk
delivery from elsewhere.  (Reliable enough it's hard to
remember it's even there :-) .)  The issue is, there was
_no choice_, no freedom to live my own life and deal as I
freely chose with what was being sold as just another
package on a shelf in a store.  The sense was, they weren't
doing me a favor--and the supervisor made no mention of that,
interestingly--, they were doing themselves a favor and there
was no way to opt out of the &quot;favor&quot;.

Re why that's an issue, it's just a standard privacy/security
matter.  And it was truly kindof silly, as well as kindof
oppressive.  (In any case, I'd have felt the same, but it is
true also that I've recently had a bad experience with
AppleCare only partially fixing an iBook's video--like fixing
a car hood which flew off and was destroyed, by replacing it
with a hood with a dent in it, and then saying the new dent
wasn't important because it couldn't be seen while driving
and it didn't affect the &quot;functioning&quot; of the hood.  The kind
of thing Big Brother can get away with, maybe like an
apparently not-fully-tested OS upgrade.)  If your friends
don't tell you when you start making mistakes, your enemies
certainly won't.
