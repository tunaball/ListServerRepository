Consumer rights are pretty much trampled on these days. You might have a chance in small claims court. This one guy had a few bad pixels and went to small claims court and won $5000 from Apple. The display was within the Apple specification but that specification wasn't public. In your case, you probably had a reasonable expectation that major problems would not be the outcome.

But in your case, it's not worth much. I'm sure that Apple will have fixes for the bugs that were caused, soon. That's not too difficult for customers to install. An apology is what you'd need on the personal level, but companies rarely do that in such cases.

How Apple handles this will make them appear as, or not as, Microsoft.

There used to be a much more extensive testing department within Apple that could halt shipment of bad product. But that was disbanded. I'm pretty sure they would have prevented this problem from getting out, but you can never be sure.

I don't know if the reason for the bad update has been publicized but what I've heard is fairly atrocious.
