Kynan,

I thank you for the information, but I think that in my case it might 
again be the actual adapter.  This happened both of the recent times at 
work, on a UPS with two Intel boxes and a monitor that are unchanged 
throughout the day.  The problem persisted even at home later that day 
(again on an UPS) until I wiggled the adapter wire at the computer end 
and plugged and unplugged it a couple of times.  Finally the glowing 
ring lit up again.

I will try plugging the wall end in first from now on and see if that 
makes a difference in the frequency of this happening.  But if I 
recall, both times the ring was fine in the morning and then later in 
the day I noticed the battery meter ticking and the ring off.

Thanks again.

--Justin
