The new Finder is very cool and best of all newbies will no longer be
confused by the file selector. It is exactly like the Finder. Given that the
shelf is customizable it is easy to jump to favorite folders.

iCal seems no different than the most recent version but I'm not an iCal
fanatic so there could be hidden differences. I don't use mail because in
Jaguar it didn't play nice with multiple addresses and scripts that move
mail into different folders. Doing that made mail forget which address the
message was sent to. Not good for lists. But I did take a quick gander since
my wife likes mail. It is faster and threaded email is very nice.

Those of us with new Alum PowerBooks have another possible memory hurdle.
There are reports on Apple's discussion site of installation problems with
new PB that have had memory added. Most users (including myself and my boss)
were able to install Panther after removing the upgrade. I've now gone
through 2 different memory upgrades.

One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them
One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
