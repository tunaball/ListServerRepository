Pull the keyboard and see what it has for RAM.  If it has two modules, 
try them one at a time.  My Ti 800 (1GB RAM) did something similar to 
that about six months ago.  It turned out to be one of the 512MB RAM 
modules that was flaky.  I put a new module in and it's been fine ever 
since.  If it only has one RAM module, you may as well take it to an 
AASP, since you'd have to buy another module to verify that it has bad 
RAM.

To get the CD out of the drive, take something rather small and pointy, 
like a pen filler, and poke it in on the right side of the drive bay.  
You'll feel a little button in there past the dust shield that'll 
manually eject the CD from the drive.  Power has to on to get it to 
eject.
