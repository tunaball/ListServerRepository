Nope. No coincidence. But it wasn't effective everywhere and I'm not
convinced it was intentional. it could be some kind of special thing with
permissions, but I was running as root. This was repeatable on all newer
G4 hardware I tried it on at the time. It did work on a Dual G4 550, so I
also managed to get a backup finally. Also, it was with Panther I first
encountered this, so it wasn't in Jaguar I think. It seemed only to be
effective in newer machines with Panther and the type of CD-R burner
could be affecting things as well.
It should be noted that it was only original Apple CDs that were copy-
prevented that I had these symptoms with. I managed to make backup copies
of my uncopyable (hole in the disc) audio apps on the same machine, which
was wonderful as I could store away the originals, instead of using them
on the road for authentication and such. 

Wasn't there also a similar story on Tiger/Toast 7? Prevention of some
music burning? 

To prevent copying is of course not malicious, just an inconvenience.
What I didn't like about the prevention was that it didn't inform of what
was the problem.
