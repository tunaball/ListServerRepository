<PRE>I will join the chorus too. Also have a 1.67GHz AIBook with 1 GB 
memory and running 10.4.3. I think it is better with this upgrade. I 
have got so used to being vigilant with its jumpy, twitchy behaviour 
it has become second nature to me. I think it might be better but 
still far from perfect.

My last computer (667 DVI TiBook) had a marvelous, by comparison, 
trackpad. Not only in its accuracy but with the general, tactile 
touch, drag etc. The difference is the drag/scroll addition to the 
feature set. Which I love and use but would like the same old 
wonderful trackpad I was used to. Too bad we have to give up to get. 
&lt;grin&gt;

I complained to Apple last April when I purchased the PBook. Even got 
a repair authorization but never could pry the Pbook from my &quot;Cold 
Dead Hands&quot; long enough to get it repaired. I was also concerned that 
tearing it apart could end up being more of a hassle with more 
subsequent issues than it has now. Been down that road.

Now I am watching it more carefully with these comments from you 
both. Nice to know I'm not alone in this. Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i>Of course, Apple never really acknowledged there was a problem (and
