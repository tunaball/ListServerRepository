<PRE>I don't understand this &quot;shooting the corporate foot&quot; business.  Why
would Apple not want to switch from IBM to Intel?  IBM couldn't pump
out low-heat, energy efficient processors.  Apple's most successful
ventures are based around innovative and portable devices.  With IBM's
PowerPC heat issues, it's nearly impossible for them to make a
feasible g5 laptop, so you can imagine how far off tiny electronic
devices with a similar processor would be.  Also, I don't know how
many of you actually interact with IBM products on a day-to-day basis,
but let's just say that they are not exactly top of the line (and they
should be for that RIDICULOUS price!).

So, to recap, Apple chooses Intel because Intel certainly has the
resources to pump out efficient, quality chips - but it's not PowerPC,
memory mapped architecture, yada yada yada.  Well Mac OSX is BSD
based, so my prediction is that MacTels will outperform standard PCS
with similar specs, based purely on the efficiency and consistency of
BSD.

To close my argument, my experiences with Intel have been nothing but
positive.  They offer excellent support and they have extensive
hardware monitoring on their boards and processors.  All this bad rap
about AMD being better with less pipeline stages on their chips and
all this other nonsense is avoiding the big picture - with Intel you
are going to get a chip that is highly efficient with its voltage
requirements, with accordingly very low heat, and a longer life than
extremely hot AMD chips.  So why not have Intel macs?
