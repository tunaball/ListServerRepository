Not &quot;probably&quot; at all.

I think what you're saying/asking is &quot;Is ease the reason why there  
are so many viruses in the Windows world?&quot;

The answer: yes!

It is easy to do, because the OS is inherently insecure with some  
security added on later.  Look at the recent Sony rootkit fiasco  
(*).  The OS allowed for a program to be installed which completely  
undermined the security of the operating system.

NOTE: **** anti virus and anti spyware programs did NOTHING to  
protect against this security flaw.
' **** (Remember that next time you hear someone say &quot;I use anti- 
virus on Mac because I want to be protected when the first virus/ 
spyware comes along&quot;)

Realize that just because Sony succumbed to the pressure of bad PR  
does NOTHING to prevent anyone ELSE from doing THE EXACT SAME THING  
again.  Every time you install a program in Windows, it may install a  
rootkit.  Any program (**).  In Mac OS X you would at least have to  
enter your administrator password.

The first &quot;spyware&quot; / &quot;malware&quot; program for OS X will come in a  
program where people blindly type in their administrator password.   
There is NO DEFENSE for this kind of stupidity.  If you download a  
program from an untrusted source and then blindly type in your  
password when asked, you will be at risk.  No anti-spyware program  
would help you.

I presume everyone has read this, if not it is HIGHLY recommended:

<A HREF="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/broken_windows">http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/broken_windows</A>

As usual, he does a good job in summarizing the fallacy behind the  
idea that &quot;If OS X has more users, they'd have more viruses/spyware.&quot;

Outlook Express (the free mail program bundled with Windows) is so  
poorly designed it ought to be renamed a Virus Distribution  
Application, at which point it would simply have to be considered the  
most successful application ever coded.  Many people refer to it as  
&quot;LookOut!&quot; which I think it a much more apt name :-)

  From a security standpoint, the programmers who coded it ought to  
be sued for malpractice (and Microsoft for distributing it).

(*) if you've managed to somehow miss the Sony Rootkit fiasco:

<A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=sony+rootkit">http://www.google.com/search?q=sony+rootkit</A>

<A HREF="http://news.google.com/news?q=sony%20rootkit&sa=N&tab=wn">http://news.google.com/news?q=sony%20rootkit&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn</A>

(**) There are very few programs in Windows which are just an .exe  
which can be run by itself.  Unlike Mac OS X which, for the most  
part, just says &quot;Drag this to your /Applications folder&quot; almost ALL  
Windows programs come with an installer.  Windows XP does have the  
idea of an &quot;Administrator&quot; but it's so impossible to actually do  
anything with a non-Administrator account, I don't know anyone who  
does it, and the default account which is created (the only one which  
will be used by the vast majority of people) is an administrator  
account.
