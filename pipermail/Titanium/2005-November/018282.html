<PRE>
I just came across:

Hibernate on your non-brandnew Mac
<A HREF="http://matt.ucc.asn.au/apple/machibernate.html">http://matt.ucc.asn.au/apple/machibernate.html</A>

And was immediately excited.  One of the only things (in fact, THE  
only thing) that my Dell does better than my Powerbook is Hibernate  
mode.

I ran the 'enable-safe-sleep.sh' script from that site (it's part of  
the &quot;few scripts&quot; link), followed by 'sudo pmset -a hibernatemode  
1'.  I rebooted (per instructions) and then logged in and closed the  
lid.

The light never started flashing (which I guess is how it is supposed  
to work).  I waited a minute or two and then reopened it and saw the  
progress bar (*) exactly as expected.

/var/vm/sleepimage is 1gb on my system (1GB of RAM on a 15&quot; 1.5Ghz  
Powerbook)

WHOO HOO!  This is great news!  I hardly ever shut my Powerbook lid  
except when going from work to home or vice versa, so this will come  
in very handy.  I'll happily wait for it to wake up (takes about 50  
seconds in my brief testing) in exchange for a true hibernate.

Plus I won't have to worry about Overbearing Stewardess who insisted  
that my Powerbook had to be OFF and not just ASLEEP.  Because, you  
know, if that lid popped open during takeoff, the whole plane might  
come down.  Oh yeah.  It could happen.  I mean, the only way I could  
possible conceive that it might happen would be if the lid popped  
open as I was rushing the cockpit with my laptop in hand and  
bludgeoned the stewardess and flight crew to death with it.  And I  
wouldn't do that, of course.  The damage it would cause the Powerbook  
would not be covered by AppleCare.

Anyway, I pass this on as a THANK YOU to Matt Johnston who figured  
this out and posted it, which I learned about from http:// 
daringfireball.net/2005/11/fmj_addenda which I read through  
NewsNetWire.  Just so much Mac-y goodness.

waking from sleep
