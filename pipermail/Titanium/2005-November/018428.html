Perhaps it does. But no one is *required* to follow Wikipedia's rules. On
this list, we are only &quot;required&quot; to follow the rules as set down by the
ListMom.

&gt;<i> A quick google for &quot;netiquette&quot; gives many links to the same basic
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>
I bet it does. And it would have as much to do with the discussion as it did
when Chris brought it up - that is to say, nothing.
 
&gt;<i> And the key part that it is rude to put stuff into public forums that

Why? Do you think you have some expectation of privacy when you send email
unbidden to a complete stranger? What makes you think I or anyone else have
some sort of obligation to you to keep your missives private?

&gt;<i> and it is also rude to
</I>&gt;<i> clutter lists with messages that are off topic and of interest to
</I>&gt;<i> only a few people.
</I>
You have no idea how many people are or are not interested in what you have
to say.

&gt;<i> Of course anyone has the right to be rude if they choose to. But as
</I>&gt;<i> in other discourse, rudeness has an effect - and it may not be the
</I>&gt;<i> one you intend.
</I>
Ooh...more thinly veiled threats....gives me shivers.
 
&gt;<i> And in case you are in any doubt I explicitly do not give you
</I>&gt;<i> permission to quote it or respond to it in public.
</I>
LOL And how did that work out for you?

I did not &quot;explicitly give you permission&quot; to email me - and yet you did.

Once again, another person seems to think they can dictate to me (or others)
what I am &quot;allowed&quot; to respond to and attempting to proscribe the manner in
which I am &quot;allowed&quot; to respond to it. And another person who seems to think
I need their &quot;permission&quot; to do *anything*.

Remarkable.
