Then it should have been better worded.

&gt;<i>  and as expressing my view on the matter to him

</I>
Yes, I did. Because I was being told not to respond to some comment on the
list. Seems ridiculous in context of what you wrote, doesn't it?

&gt;<i> I think Shawn is *right* that I can't demand from him that he behaves
</I>&gt;<i> according to widespread and accepted netiquette,
</I>
LOL As defined by who? &quot;List Rules&quot; circumvent your imagined &quot;netiquette&quot;.

&gt;<i> but I do have every
</I>&gt;<i> right to expect that he or anyone else does
</I>
Wait...you feel you have a &quot;right&quot; to expect me to behave according to your
rules? Good luck with that.

&gt;<i> and in addition I have every
</I>&gt;<i> right to express my belief that he should, also to his mailbox (until he
</I>&gt;<i> lets me know he wouldn't want that anymore).
</I>
Wha....? You think you have a &quot;right&quot; to send email to me unrequested? You
have a right to send me an email scolding me on my behavior?

And why do I have to &quot;let you know&quot; that I don't want email from you
directly? Why would you assume I did want email from you? Your explanation
is exactly the same excuse spammers use to send the volumes of mail we all
get. &quot;Well, they didn't ask me *not* to send them email....&quot;

If you send email to a complete stranger, don't be surprised what that
stranger does with it.

People assume email is private - it's not. It's one of the most public
things we do on the Net.

&gt;<i> I also think Shawn is *wrong* when he says that his impression that he
</I>&gt;<i> had somehow been violated, by my freely expressed opinion to him, give
</I>&gt;<i> him an undeniable right to do with it what he wants. He could have just
</I>&gt;<i> expressed himself right back to me.
</I>
Ah...so you can choose the method in which you communicate to me but I don't
have the same &quot;right&quot;?

Can you hear the hypocrisy in what you are saying?

&gt;<i> E X T R A  E X T R A  V I O L A T A T I O N  O F  F R E E  S P E E C H:
</I>
LOL Again, you have no right to free speech on a mailing list. You can keep
screaming it from the rooftops if you'd like but it doesn't make it so.
 
&gt;<i> Here's my alleged &quot;attack&quot;, sent in private, on Shawns right to freely
</I>&gt;<i> express himself anywhere:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This have been and gone and further comments at this point are quite
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wow! I can really see how Shawns rights to free speech were diminished by
</I>&gt;<i> my outrageous comment that truly undermined his (perceived) authority.
</I>
LOL I have no authority on this list. You credit me with more influence than
I have.
