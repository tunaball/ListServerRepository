</I>Chris,

I'm a diehard Apple end-user, but how come that caller ratio that you got
does not translate into a 3:1 sales ratio in FAVOR of the Mac? 

As far as the G5 is concerned - I've checked out the G5s on some of the
applications and, while faster than the G4s, there was not that amazing
difference in performance and speed that I recall when the Mac moved from
the 9600 series to the G3.

I say - let's wait for the Macintels to appear before dissing them. And,
while we're at it - who's to say that Apple can't/won't offer ALL of the
CPUs in its future computer products? I can see Apple offering Intel, AMD
and PPC all at the same time. I believe that the best is yet to come!

Best,

Henry
