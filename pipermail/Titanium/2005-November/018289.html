<PRE>One of the burning points that I brought up in my earlier posts was
about the fact that there have been no g5 powerbooks.  This is
precisely what I don't understand about your argument, Chris.  You
seem to say that IBM has PowerPC processors that are faster, smaller,
cooler, than anything else - like some kind of wonder processors
straight from the divine, but no one has seen these used in practical
applications.  Also, as far as the points you've made, such as the
&quot;divide-by-zero&quot; argument, I agree with Mikael in believing that Apple
has the funding and resources to support programmers that can address
these issues.  However, if these are real things to worry about, I
would appreciate it if you could cite some sources for your
information so that I can better research the topic and make a better
decision for myself in purchasing Apple products in the future. 
Highly technical articles are welcome - I've developed several
projects in both x86 and PowerPC architecture.
