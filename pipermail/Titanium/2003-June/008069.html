I take my TiBook back and forth to work everyday, in sleep mode. :) I 
don't use a screen protector or keyboard cover. I just wipe off my 
screen with a lens cleaning cloth and LCD screen cleaner.

Kynan's post reminded me of the time my then 3yr old (4yr today) drew a 
big circle on my screen with a ball point pen. I just used the cloth 
and cleaner and removed the ink and I don't even notice a trace of it. 
I had completely forgot about that until today.

All these covers and protectors remind me of my grandma and her plastic 
covered furniture. Not that there is anything wrong with that. Maybe 
it's because I am a chronic hand washer that I don't have much finger 
oil.

I do have some minor paint flaking. I have a little less that one month 
on my 1 year Apple hardware warranty.  Does anyone know if this is 
covered?
