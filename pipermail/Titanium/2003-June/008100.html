<PRE>Hi Jason:

I have a cassette-player interface, too. In every place I tried (two cars 
and in my office) the fidelity using the cassette-player interface was 
superior to that of the iTrip.  A good friend used the term &quot;poor dynamic 
range&quot; when he listened and I think I agree with him. Again, the signal 
strength was quite low so maybe that's why it didn't make a better showing.

Here are the lines from my original message concerning fidelity. I've 
underlined the phrase &quot;the fidelity was poor&quot; but I'm not sure that this 
list server will pass the underlining.

Since I used that phrase three times in my original message and despite 
that you're asking about  fidelity, would it be paranoid to wonder whether 
you're pulling my leg?

&gt;<i>In my car its output was barely sufficient to allow enough signal to 
</I>&gt;<i>travel from the dashboard to the whip antenna, even with the iPod volume 
</I>&gt;<i>turned up to the limit. The fidelity was poor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In my wife's car the FM antenna is built into the back window. I was able 
</I>&gt;<i>to get it to play decently by placing the unit only by placing in on the 
</I>&gt;<i>back ledge. Of course it couldn't be controlled from the front seat once I 
</I>&gt;<i>did that so I simply let it play continuously. The fidelity was poor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In my office the iTrip had to touch the antenna of my FM radio to produce 
</I>&gt;<i>sufficient volume to overcome the RF noise from several nearby computers. 
</I>&gt;<i>The fidelity was poor.
</I>
