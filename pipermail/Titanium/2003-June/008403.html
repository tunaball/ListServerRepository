<PRE>For what little it may be worth, what resolution settings were
variously used?  I've been involved in a couple of LCD projector
group puzzlings (none QT movies, tho), and being sure the laptop
resolution setting matched the projector's capability(-ies) made
a difference.  In one case, the projector was somewhat old, and
needed 640X480 which the (new IBM) laptop couldn't produce.  In
your case, did you try different resolutions?

(In other case, my showing my 700MHz 16VRAM then-OS10.1.4 iBook
dancing through resolutions and connectors when noone else could
get the projector to work was a major influence in 3 CSI grad
students buying Macs within a year, 2 tiBooks and 1 12&quot; alBook.)
