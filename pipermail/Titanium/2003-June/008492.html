My belief is it will be some time before the G5 Powerbooks are released.
For starters, Apple needs to push powermac sales.  I think I read 
somewhere before that powermacs are the products that they get the most 
profit from, and sales have been horrible in recent times.  Putting the 
G5 in Powermacs alone will give a great boost for sales for a while.
As for an upcoming 15&quot; powerbook in aluminum enclosure--it'll probably 
happen soon, and I'd guess with upgraded speeds to the entire line, but 
I can't see them putting a G5 in at that point.
Heat and power use.  I hear many different things about IBM's 970 and I 
really don't know what to believe.  But, there's a chance that the G5 
won't work in well in the current enclosures, and why change them now?

However, there's also a good chance the aluminum enclosure was made 
with the 970 in mind.  There's also the whole &quot;Year of the Laptop&quot; 
thing that stirs things up a little.  And as to those who remember that 
it took over a year to put a G4 in a laptop after it was in a 
tower--well what about the G3?  It went into powerbooks the same time 
they released powermacs with it.

I still believe it's going to be a while, but we'll see.
