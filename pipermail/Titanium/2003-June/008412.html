I am beginning to think that this was the issue.  My T-500 screen is 
set at 1152 x 768.
Perhaps for the projector, I should have set it for 800 x 600.
This could explain why my Ti- desktop/ background was projected on to 
the big screen.  Perhaps the Dock and Menu bar and Disk Partitions, 
and even the QT Window, were 'there' but not visible because only the 
800 x600 central part of the Ti-desktop was projected, and they were 
off-screen.
I happen to remember that my QT window was at the edge of the 
desktop, so all the data fits the hypothesis.

&gt;<i>(In other case, my showing my 700MHz 16VRAM then-OS10.1.4 iBook

</I>
I was rather hoping for the Ti to demonstrate a capability that would 
have had similar effects!

Next time, perhaps.  I will in any case take my Ti along and see if I 
can get to the bottom of this issue.

Thanks for your suggestion, Tom.
