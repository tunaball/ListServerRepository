<PRE>Hi Khyber,

Okay, so to answer your original question (not discuss Quickbooks 
pros/cons and platform issues).

While I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Mac addict (see footer below -- I have a 
TiBook 550 to keep this marginally on topic ;-) my husband, 
unfortunately, must live on the dark side for his job.

We just got him an HP Pavillion ze4325 (open box at BestBuy so it was 
better than current prices ~$800). It seems reasonably sturdy and fair 
config. with, Athlon 2000+ processor, 40 gig drive, 256MB base memory, 
DVD/CD-RW drive, USB, PCMCIA slots, etc. We're going to at least double 
the memory shortly.

At least one ze4300 series has mini firewire and an included adapter to 
make use of firewire peripherals such as drives, cameras, etc. My 
husband opted for the cheaper solution (open box) and we got a $50 
firewire PCMCIA card (non-bus powered drives will work on it) for him 
to use my DV camera. I think I just saw an ad (maybe BestBuy?) for the 
ze4315, one model down from ours, for $789 after rebates ($200 from 
BestBuy/HP?). On HP's web the ze 4000 series starts at $699 and you can 
order ready-to-ship or customize one (if you customize they currently 
have a free shipping offer).

It is heavy and the design is ghastly compared to my TiBook 550. But, 
price was right and it serves its purpose for him. He isn't a road 
warrior, though this will go from home to office with him almost daily. 
I wouldn't recommend this big/heavy a notebook for anyone traveling a 
lot.

I have acquaintances who swear by their Sony Vaio notebooks. For a Win 
notebook they are slightly better design than most others and there are 
some lighter models. Price isn't cheap on most of these models though. 
But with the Sony you *can* get a lighter book depending upon what 
components you find useful/necessary. Many who WISH they could have 
Mac's but are required by their work to use Win often opt for a Sony 
due to slightly better hardware styling.

Their are a variety of deals out there on HP's, Compaq's and Sony's 
lately.

I've had bad experiences with Toshiba's. Don't know if that was just 
our bad luck or if they are the bottom rung of Win notebooks.

Good luck. (-:

Cheers,
Jenn
