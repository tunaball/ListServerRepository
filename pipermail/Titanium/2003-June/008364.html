Buggy maybe - but personally the issues with Quark/Classic (we're not
talking about running in OS9) for me far outweighed the benefits of staying
with Quark anyway.. Moved to ID a long long time ago.. Not looking back. I
hear too many talking like OSX is still 'in waiting' or something.. The
tools to do the job are out there - use them.. Or not. OS9 is d-e-a-d for
me. This whole argument made the rounds when System 7 came along.. And when
Mac's went PPC.. If you choose to live in the past, good luck with that.

Many refuse to even jump to Quark 5 (I did) it was BARELY an upgrade to 4.11
- but when you have an investment to protect, buying out of date software is
not an option.. Especially those who own Non OS9 bootable machines. Who in
their right mind would spend $6000+ on a new tower and gear and then spend
another $1000 on software that isn't supported by the currently installed
OS?? If you have an old machine, then I guess you have to work with what
works.

Whatever gets you there. But I stand by my response to anyone using 9 for
that odd - once in a while job.. There are too many solutions out there to
replace Quark. Damn, even Corel (shudder) is ahead of the game with OSX. So,
Stone Studio, ID, Corel.. Quark who? As for buying all those Xtensions..
Ouch, sucks to be you. With the new coding, you'll have to upgrade each and
every one of them - I hope there are some generous programmers out there.
