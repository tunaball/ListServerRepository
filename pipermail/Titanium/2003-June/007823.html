Yes, I also remember getting an invalid disk size. But it didn't happen this way every time.  It is odd that these problems are so obvious but I get told by Apple that 80 GB drives work fine.

Here's how I made it to 80 GB internally. I lucked out because this was my first attempt. I installed a new 80 GB drive in my Big Al and booted on the Big Al System Software DVD to [format] it. I then booted on my original 60 GB drive in an external firewire enclosure. I ran CCC from this external drive and copied it to the new one.

WARNING: Don't try copies or Finder actions with both drives named the same, with OS X. This applies to USB drives and camera media cards as well as firewire drives and your internal drive. I have been hosed a few times making this 'mistake'.
