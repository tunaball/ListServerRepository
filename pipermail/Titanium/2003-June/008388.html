<PRE>
This evening, I was at a small business event, where there was a 
speaker.  He had a PC laptop, and his presentation was in Powerpoint. 
We had an almost new LCD projector.  When we were &quot;setting up&quot; before 
the meeting, he told us that he had a short (50 Mb) mpg movie to show 
during his presentation.  When he ran it on his PC laptop, it was OK 
on the laptop screen, but did not appear on the big projector screen.

I said, let me try it with my Ti-500.  So I connected my Ti-book to 
the LCD projector, and my 'desktop' background was projected by the 
LCD projector on to the big screen.

His presentation and movie were on a CD.
When I launched the mpg movie (Quicktime 6.3) it apened and ran  on 
my Ti-book screen.

However, it was not visible (nothing was except my desktop) on the big screen.

Then another colleague put the CD in to his (3 year old) PC laptop, 
opened the movie with QT5, and the movie ran fine on his screen and 
was immediately viewable on the big screen as well.

So all was fine, as far as our speaker and his presentation.

However, I was very disappointed that my Ti500 did not perform !
The igmony of an old PC running Quicktime to show a movie that my 
Apple laptop could not project.

Does anyone have any idea what I should have done?  Why was the LCD 
projector correctly detected, the desktop (background ) shown on hte 
big screen, but nothing else?

My Displays Preferences did not show me anything to check ot change.

I am sure the answer is very simple, but I could not find it in the 
short time available.

Your experience, wisdom and suggestions are welcome, so that next 
time, the Ti-book will perform correctly.

regard,  Trevor

Ti-500/10.2.6/1Gb RAM
