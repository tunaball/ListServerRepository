<PRE>Thanks to the great responses from lots of you with respect to this issue.  You are terrific as always.

Here's the latest:

1.  I wasn't even signed onto &quot;AOL Anywhere&quot; or &quot;AOL Instant Messenger&quot; (AIM) and heard the &quot;door opening.&quot;  So I signed onto both, and watched the &quot;AIM Express&quot; and sure enough the &quot;door closed&quot; when a friend signed off of AOL.

2.  What this means is that AIM is working even though (1) I am not signed onto AOL, and (2) AIM hasn't been launched (or loaded).  AIM is always in the background &quot;lurking.&quot;

3.  I have never used AIM since I got my Ti 800 a year ago, but I have set it up to be used.

One of the wonderful list members sent me a message offline today, which said:

&quot;You do realize&#160;that if you have your buddy list preferences set&#160;&#160;you will hear the door open when a buddy comes online&#160;and the door close sound&#160;when a buddy goes offline.&#160; They don't have to contact you.&#160; You just hear the sound.&#160;&#160; This has nothing to do with being on an aol site.&#160;&#160; This occurs&#160;whenever you are on the internet&#160;using your aol&#160;account.&quot;

It was suggested that the sound might be turned off; however, &quot;AOL Anywhere&quot; does not have the features that AOL software apparently has.

The larger issue, which was my original concern -- namely, privacy -- remains, it seems.  Yet, maybe this is a unique issue for AOL users.

Thanks again to all.  Obviously privacy raises larger issues for all of us.
