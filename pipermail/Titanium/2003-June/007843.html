This 80 gb hard drive situation is really something! Thanks, however to your
experience, Steve, my problem is now solved. When I made my first attempt at
trying to clone my original drive, it failed, and now I know the reason -
it's because  I had both drives (the original and the clone drive (80gb))
named the same. So, I opted to load the 80 gb back into big al, booted up
with my original 60gb in the external, loaded disk utility to format the
80gb drive, and then cloned the 60 to the 80. Everything worked flawlessly.
I'm now running big al with an internal 80. Thanks Steve!!!
