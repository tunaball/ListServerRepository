...can be found and _potentially_ exploited...

There are, as far as I know, no general vulnerabilities associated with 
simply having a port open. Furthermore, Apple has been quite good at 
updating the built in services (that are disabled by default) as 
vulnerabilities in the applications appear.

I would say that 90% of warnings raised by firewalls are false alarms, 
resulting from normal use of the network. Of the remaining 10%, I think 
9.9% would not have any idea what to do when they find a Mac on the 
other side. They may try to run a few common Windows exploits, try to 
log in over ssh with no password. The remaining 0.1% is the dangerous 
one. To avoid being attacked by that knowledgable tenth of a percent, 
make sure you keep up on the security updates (Software Update) and 
that you don't leave services on unless you really need them. And if 
you do need FTP or SSH, that you make sure to choose good (meaning 
long, complicated) passwords. If possible, replace FTP by using SFTP 
with SSH.

The only port I can think of that is open on a default Mac OS X 
install, is 631, for the CUPS print server. As far as I know, there 
hasn't ever been an exploit that made use of that, though.
