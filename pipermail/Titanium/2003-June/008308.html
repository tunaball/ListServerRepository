<PRE>My question is:
When I'm trying to copy my User folder over to an separate HD a warning 
message states that the folder &quot;contains files that you can not read. 
Do you wish to contiue?&quot; Answering in affirmative the amount copied 
seem to be just about everything, but how can I see the files, which 
weren't copied? Or to be precise &#8211; can I somehow search for &quot;not 
readable files&quot;? Preferably without using Terminal, even if I can 
handle that with a detailed description. :-)

Can I use Copy Clooner with more success and is that necessary, so that 
I'm not missing something vital now that I'm about the reformat the 
whole HD and reinstall from the beginning?

Help appreciated. Thank you :-)

The reason for this drastic measure and possibly a clue to what files 
are unreadable:

Since the latest Apple Security update (around 13th of June), my Ti 400 
with OS 10.2.6 has behaved more and more funny. Not blaming the 
security it could be several other reasons, but at one restart I had a 
broad blue banner across the screen demanding me some unusual login 
identification.

It accepted me after a few atempts with my main passwords. Another test 
restart and login, worked normally. Then some day later Adobe 
PhotoElements (which always has started with an alert with no text in 
it, but working fine) said that I needed to reinstall because some 
necessary file in the Adobe folder was missing. Didn't care much until 
I had a similar message in PhotoShop 7. When still some other program 
indicated that some essential application folder was faulty or missing 
I decided that I should try a restart and some Disk Utility and then 
Repair Permission.

Now suddenly my login had changed to the name I used with OS 10.1 and a 
(to the best of my knowledge) deleted Test user appeared as an 
alternativ login. No password alternative was good enough for my name 
(though I know I used the correct one) and I also tried my other main 
passwords without success. Could however login in as Test user since 
that account was set for automatic log in and the OS is shown as 10.2.6 
as it should be. Can restart in 9.2.2 without any problem and when 
logged in as Test user, OS10.2.6 will allow and identity my admin name 
and password when needed.

Decided I may as well do the long overdue reinstall of the whole thing 
but will of course prefer that all the files in my User folder will be 
intact.
