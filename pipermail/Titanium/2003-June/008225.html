<PRE>Sorry, I hate to take up bandwidth, but I had such good luck selling my iPod
on the list that I had to come back with my mothers pismo.  She is wanting
to buy the TiBook 800 that another listee listed, but wants to know that she
can get rid of her pismo first, so here it is:
14.1&quot;, 400mhz G3, 384mb of RAM (it may be 512, but I'm pretty sure it's
384), 20gb HD (this was installed one year ago, and was a new drive from
transintl), and it even has AppleCare until the end of July, so if there are
any problems, apple will fix them under warranty.

That said, there aren't any problems-- this computer has been babied by a 60
year old business woman, it runs cool, plays DVDs, dual FireWire, all around
a very solid machine.  The battery was also replaced 3 weeks ago, so it is
in EXCELLENT conditions (it was &quot;broken in&quot; using apple's instructions).
This would also be an excellent candidate to be upgraded to a G4 (some
company released an upgrade kit about 9 months ago).  Asking price is $850,
but that is somewhat negotiable.  They are selling for $750-800 on ebay with
6gb hard drives, and worn out batteries (before the replacement, she was
getting 20-30 minutes of battery life).  If you are interested, let me know,
this would be the ideal computer for a high school or college student, as
it's inexpensive, durable, and still somewhat powerful (she runs 10.2 on it,
and it runs very well)
