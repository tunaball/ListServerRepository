<PRE>Hi Kynan-

I agree. I have to say, even with my RadTech cloth in there, I'm still 
getting impressions of the keboard on the screen-they're just not the 
sharper, more focused marks of the edges of the keys. I suspect that 
the contact is still there, (is the refrig light really off when you 
close the door?), and as you pointed out, maybe even more so because of 
the increase of material between keys and screen-but there's no oil (I 
don't type on the keyboard, I leave it covered and use the external, 
and the cloth would block any oil from the rare typing on the keyboard).

So this leads me to conclude that it's essentially unavoidable, 
especially if you carry the book in a case, and put, say, your Franklin 
Planner on top as you lay the bag on your car seat... pressing the 
screen into the keyboard even more. So the best you can do is minimize 
and mitigate the damage, which is what the right protector could offer.
That's my $.02 FWIW.
