How is this possible? Oh, you mean the _battery_ there to &quot;UPS&quot; it... I 
get it.
At first I wondered if there were some sort of inherent surge 
protection while in sleep mode...
So... is there? I saw a DELL commercial recently where they talked 
about shock-testing their machines, dropping them a few feet down for 
impact testing, etc. (ouch... that'll leave a mark...)

I'm wondering what Apple does, if anything, along these lines. I can 
remember being at Mac World years ago and they had released a little 
kids computer, possibly a pre-cursor to the first gen i-books (plastic, 
clamshell style). I was standing there talking to the young lady and 
asked how well the computers would hold up to their target market - 
kids. She took one off the podium, turned and dropped it from 
chest-height onto the hard, (Moscone Convention Center carpeted) floor. 
I was stunned.
Not a mark on it.
I wonder what BigAl would do if I did that to him?

Now back to our regularly scheduled program...
