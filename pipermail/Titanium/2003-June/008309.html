<PRE>I got my Ti 867 in April, so I know exactly what you meant by broke and happy :-)

As for your question on Ms Office and Virtual PC:


We are having tons of trouble here at the office with the people that are on
Jaguar but still on MS Office 98 and 2001 (boss is too frugal *cough* cheap
*cough* to upgrade everybody). I don't have issues because I work off my
personal Ti Book and I paid for all my software, including Ms Office v.X, VPC
6 and BBEdit Pro 7.

The main reason I have VPC 6 running is to manage our Windows 2000 servers
remotely, since the Microsoft Remote Desktop client for OS X does not allow
dragging and dropping between a terminal server session and the desktop. In
that capacity VPC works really nice, since the only programs I ever run on VPC
6 (as Windows 2000 Pro) are a virus scanner, SQL Server 2000 Enterprise
Manager and SQL Server 2000 Query Analyzer.

As for Starbucks, it is worth every penny if you either travel or live in an
area that is well penetrated by the company. I live in the DC metro area and
out of the dozens of Starbucks in the area I have found TWO that don't have
Hot Spot (I live right smack in the heart of suburbia and I can drive to 7
Starbucks that have Hot Spot, all within 5-6 miles of the house). I carry the
laptop wherever I go and it is nice to spot a Starbucks and know I will
probably be able to chill with my coffee and go online for a bit. The amusing
thing is that the only Starbucks that is within walking distance from my
office does not have it, but at least that one is almost by an Apple store, so
I just have to walk-in and park on the first empty mac I see!


Thanks,

Pedro Vera

Subject: [Ti] New TiBook; have questions

&gt;<i> Hi, 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just got a TiBook/867/Combo, and I'm in love [broke but happy] --
</I>&gt;<i>  tethered to the office no longer!!  Starbuck's here I come ..... 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I set it up, updated to the latest Apple updates, and explored over 
</I>&gt;<i> the weekend (new to OSX).  I'd like to ask the list members for 
</I>&gt;<i> sugges
</I>
tions about which utility software packages I should use,
&gt;<i>  particularly drive &amp; file handling, before I dive too deeply into 
</I>&gt;<i> loading apps, etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I already have the following, originally purchased for my G3:
</I>&gt;<i> o   FWB Hard Disk Toolkit v4.0
</I>&gt;<i> o   TechTool Pro v3.03 (plus whatever version just arrived with 
</I>&gt;<i> AppleCare) o   Norton SystemWorks v2.0 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have purchased the Norton Anti-Virus v9 (7 for Classic) and 
</I>&gt;<i> installed it, and scanned the TiBook.  I have Toast Titanium (latest 
</I>&gt;<i> version); not installed yet. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen discussion about Disk Warrior -- any comments, given 
</I>&gt;<i> what I already own?  Should I upgrade one of the apps I currently 
</I>&gt;<i> have, or is there a strong consensus that DW will better suit my 
</I>&gt;<i> needs? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What about Norton SystemWorks v3.0? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  TTPro site says, buy Drive 10 now and get TTPro v4 free when 
</I>&gt;<i> it's released.  Anyone using Drive 10?
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  FWB HDTK v4.5.2 upgrade available for $30, but I don't think 
</I>&gt;<i> it's for OSX .. ?  And if I continue to use it on the G3/OSv9.2.2, 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone know if I should go ahead and upgrade it to v4.5.2?  FWB 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't answering emailed or telephone message queries. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have MS-Office 98/Mac --- has anyone installed it under Classic? 
</I>&gt;<i>  Not crazy about the cost of new Office -- it'd be cheaper to 
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade my copy of Virtual PC (and run Win2000, which I have, plus 
</I>&gt;<i> MS-Office 2000, which I have) or get VirtualPC/WinXP (thereby 
</I>&gt;<i> learning XP and also probably able to use MS-Office 2000).  Of 
</I>&gt;<i> course, in that case, I'm faced with backing up and 
</I>&gt;<i> formatting/partitioning.  And also, there's the fact that I can't 
</I>&gt;<i> get Connectix to reply to emails asking about upgrade charges from 
</I>&gt;<i> older versions ..... 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What other apps/utilities are recommended?  I'll have tons of apps 
</I>&gt;<i> on both the OSX system and in Classic. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to everyone for any suggestions and opinions,
</I>&gt;<i> Deb
