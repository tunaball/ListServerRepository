<PRE>There are only two things that can slow down my mighty Ti 867/512MB:

1. Put it to sleep without unmounting smb volumes (confuses the finder for a few minutes after 
wake up)
2. Do ANYTHING with Dreamweaver MX (thanks God the company paid for it, not me!). What a 
POS.

Except for these two things, mine runs rock solid regardless of what I do. I keep VPC 6 with 
Windows 2000 Pro up and running at least 10 of the 15-18 hours I average per day with the 
laptop and for all I care OSX (10.2.6) does not even notice it is running. At the same time I have 
iChat, MSN Messenger, Ircle, BBEdit Pro 7, iTunes 4, MS Remote Desktop, Safari and Mail.app 
running, plus at least two smb shares connected. 

Oh, plus a few terminal windows with at least 2 SSH sessions running. I run Safari with at least 
5-6 tabs per window, and BBEdit usually has a half dozen files open at any given time. VPC is 
used exclusively to manage MS SQL Servers, so except for a stray IE 6 window and a virus 
scanner, the only things running on VPC are MS SQL Server's Enterprise Manager, the Query 
Analyzer and the DTS Wizard.

When Panther comes out I'll just max out the ram and wait at least a year before considering 
purchasing a next generation 15&quot; powerbook, that is, if they ever come out.

Thanks,

Pedro Vera

Subject: [Ti] Pushing the limits of 867MHz

&gt;<i> I'm back in my old habit of having numerous applications and windows 
</I>&gt;<i> open simultaneously. On my old Mac, I could expect trouble with more 
</I>&gt;<i> than 8 applications open - depending on the apps, of course. I think 
</I>&gt;<i> I spend a lot of time counting how many windows were open all the time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I bought my TiBook with only 256MB of RAM and increased it to 768MB
</I>&gt;<i> within weeks. I've had very few application crashes/hangs and minor
</I>&gt;<i> system glitches. (The main system glitch seems to be the display 
</I>&gt;<i> which gets what looks like &quot;interference&quot; as seen on tv when the 
</I>&gt;<i> local station is off air. But, I can't find a rhyme or reason for it,
</I>&gt;<i>  even if only one application is running.) Otherwise, nothing 
</I>&gt;<i> happening to inhibit use of my PowerBook.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyhow, I happened to notice I had 14 applications open today - some 
</I>&gt;<i> with more than ten windows. (I counted 34 open documents in Smile -
</I>&gt;<i>  what a robust application!) The system was calm, cool and collected 
</I>&gt;<i> without any noticeable slowdown and a few files downloaded from 
</I>&gt;<i> Safari without a hitch, iTunes smoothly providing background music.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, I'm doing a lot in between applications with major window 
</I>&gt;<i> and application switching all over the place. I can't multitask my 
</I>&gt;<i> way out of a paper bag at work, but with my Mac, it's all about 
</I>&gt;<i> assuasive control after a good dose of iTunes therapy on the commute 
</I>&gt;<i> home. For others, how many applications do you find are open at 
</I>&gt;<i> once? Are you more likely to check what other applications are 
</I>&gt;<i> already running, or do you just launch and worry about it if and 
</I>&gt;<i> when a problem arises? Anyone ever had so many applications open 
</I>&gt;<i> that opening one more they immediately noticed decreased 
</I>&gt;<i> performance? Has anyone else noticed that having to restart requires 
</I>&gt;<i> several minutes to close windows and applications, as well as being 
</I>&gt;<i> surprised how many documents had not been saved recently? I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> feel compelled to save as frequently with OS X because the aliens stopped
</I>&gt;<i> jumping into my computer and making it crash for no reason. (Just
</I>&gt;<i> checking to see if you are paying attention.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I realize those doing graphic rendering or whatever might have noticeable
</I>&gt;<i> performance hits with numerous open applications, but for the semi-normal
</I>&gt;<i> (on the days I get enough sleep) people running only a few really
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;intense&quot; applications, how the heck do you explain to pc folks that 
</I>&gt;<i> it isn't living dangerously to immerse yourself in multiple-window-
</I>&gt;<i> multiple- application multi-tasking without going insane? My co-
</I>&gt;<i> workers are constantly closing up windows and applications on the pc 
</I>&gt;<i> I have to use at work, to my irritation. It just seems more natural 
</I>&gt;<i> to flow in and out of different tasks than to waste time launching 
</I>&gt;<i> and closing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm gonna have to save money for a new PowerBook, because I can already
</I>&gt;<i> see myself running 50+ applications at a time in Panther. So, I'll need
</I>&gt;<i> to upgrade to a G5 just so that I'll have mega-RAM capabilities for
</I>&gt;<i> multitasking. I now have 40 documents open in Smile. And Safari 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem phased by multiple tabs in a dozen windows. How many 
</I>&gt;<i> tabs can one load on one browser page? Is there a limit?
