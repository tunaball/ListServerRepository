Steve - I had a problem with the spacebar on my Ti-500 in NOV 2001. 
My post to the list at that time is appended.

I also have a problem with my space bar right now (for the last few 
weeks).  It is almost 'dead' and requires a real solid push in the 
centre for it to function.  This time my friend Fred is going to give 
me a space bar from a spare USA keyboard that he has, planned for 
this Friday.

HTH.

regards,  Trevor

Trevor,

Yes, we do have spacebars. &#160;Here is a link:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.pbparts.com/store/agora.cgi?p_id=tkb">http://www.pbparts.com/store/agora.cgi?p_id=tkb</A>&gt;

To get a space bar, order four (4) keyboard parts ($20 total). 
&#160;Insured shipping to Switzerland costs $21, so you will probably have 
to accept standard uninsured shipping ($8). &#160;

Just a note: &#160;The space bar is different on various language 
keyboards. &#160;Do not assume all spacebars are equal.

-John

Dear Sir,

Can you sell me a space-bar key for my Ti-500 Powerbook ?

I was given your web-site by someone on the Ti LIST, where I had written:

Subject: [Ti] I need a new space bar ....


I had to carefully remove my space bar from my Ti-500 the other day, 
because I had to clean something which was underneath it.

I have put the space bar key back (carefully re-inserting the metal 
wires into their respective places on the keyboard).

But the correct functionality was not there.

I have taken the space bar key off, and put in on again, about 20 times.
And still it only gives me a SPACE if I press in the centre.
It has become sort of 'loose' and 'floaty' (compared to other keys).

I thought that perhaps I need a new key. &#160;I have the impression that 
a TINY piece of plastic has come off, during this/these processes.

So I took a trip to the local APPLE dealer here in Geneva.
The guy said, &quot;yeah, you need a new key&quot;.

But new keys are not available. The only solution is apparently a new 
keyboard, costing SFR 200 (~ $125), and since I have a USA keyboard 
(I bought my Ti at MacMall, CA), it has to be ordered specially.

Since a space bar has no nationality, I could get one from anywhere 
that they are available.

Does anyone have an idea of where I could get a space bar key for 
less than $125 ?

WHO are the people who injection mould them for Apple ?
Does anyone know ?

I would appreciate any suggestions on this very practical issue.

For the moment, about 30% of my words are joined together, so it is a 
chronic and fatiguing issue.

your website ...does say &quot;Can't find what you're looking for? Please 
email us. We have, or can get, almost anything! &quot; so I am taking you 
up on your offer....

	Could you get me a space-bar ??
