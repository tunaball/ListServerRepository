I'd like to mention that 5 miles down the road the stations signal changes
and bleeds and you dern near wreck trying to synch another channel, which
works the first time about 20% of the time. In a city, every other FM
channel is taken up by Clear Channel Communications, with very strong
bleeds. 

I found one good use for iTrip. While parked, and jammin' tunes from the car
with doors or windows open, fidelity is masked because of volume and natural
acoustic obstruction, and control of the stereo can be made up to 40 feet
away. 

Also, the radio or system an iTrip uses must be digital, no analog stereo
allowed, and small digital radios are dismal, you need to be 3 feet from
them. 

iTrip means well, it's cute, I want to like it, but it just isn't industrial
quality. Or at least mine isn't.


&gt;<i> Hi Jason:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a cassette-player interface, too. In every place I tried (two cars
</I>&gt;<i> and in my office) the fidelity using the cassette-player interface was
</I>&gt;<i> superior to that of the iTrip.  A good friend used the term &quot;poor dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> range&quot; when he listened and I think I agree with him. Again, the signal
</I>&gt;<i> strength was quite low so maybe that's why it didn't make a better showing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are the lines from my original message concerning fidelity. I've
</I>&gt;<i> underlined the phrase &quot;the fidelity was poor&quot; but I'm not sure that this
</I>&gt;<i> list server will pass the underlining.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since I used that phrase three times in my original message and despite
</I>&gt;<i> that you're asking about  fidelity, would it be paranoid to wonder whether
</I>&gt;<i> you're pulling my leg?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my car its output was barely sufficient to allow enough signal to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> travel from the dashboard to the whip antenna, even with the iPod volume
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turned up to the limit. The fidelity was poor.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my wife's car the FM antenna is built into the back window. I was able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to get it to play decently by placing the unit only by placing in on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back ledge. Of course it couldn't be controlled from the front seat once I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did that so I simply let it play continuously. The fidelity was poor.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my office the iTrip had to touch the antenna of my FM radio to produce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sufficient volume to overcome the RF noise from several nearby computers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The fidelity was poor.
