If you can tail your syslog you'd get a much more precise error message 
(one which would actually help you debug the problem).
Open terminal (...come on now, its okay - I'll hold your hand), which 
should be on all mac users docks (in my humble^H^H^H^H^H^H arrogant 
opinion). type:
tail -f /var/log/system.log

Keep that terminal window open while you attempt to burn another DVD. 
Then you can mail us the content (only the relevant parts please), and 
we might be-able to sort you out (its what the mac/OS X community is 
all ~, that and the sarcastic comments :).

Don't even go there - have you heard that joke ~ M$ support - I'll tell 
you it when the kids have gone to bed :)

Hey, you calling my 17&quot;/12&quot; AlBook defective?? Thats fighting talk 
where i come from!!!
I've not got toast, but whenever I've burn CD's or DVD's (apple brand 
DVD's only please), I've never had any problems. I always find the best 
way is to use disk copy - Anyway this would suggest to me thats its the 
toast software and not your apple hardware that has the problem (which 
is why the log message will help).

&gt;<i> But I'll bet that David is turning any marginal owners off Apple and 
</I>&gt;<i> towards saving the xtra $$$ and perhaps going to Dell, who at least 
</I>&gt;<i> service what they sell.
</I>
Well i never call support on any of my/our hardware (including dells, 
Compaq's (ow apart from ordering parts), macs, IBM's, VAX, suns, etc); 
always found them to be a waste of time. It's not as if they really 
know any more than you do (or could look up on the web).
