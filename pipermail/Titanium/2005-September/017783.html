<PRE>There are web sites that will do a comparison for you, and there are  
many many companies on the internet that sell Macs. Price is  
generally the same everywhere. The variables are: cost of shipping,  
whether you have to pay sales tax, and the extras they give you like  
free ram, printer, tote bag. The advantage of Apple is the built to  
order options. I believe they are the only ones who will include a  
larger hard drive and other built to order options. I don't think the  
freebes are really worth much. Often the extra ram they offer is too  
little and who wants a low low end printer that will cost you dearly  
in ink replacements?

So I go with someone who offers free shipping and no tax, unless I  
need built to order and then I buy it from apple. Go to ram seeker to  
get the best deal on ram, although the cheapest ones don't offer  
lifetime warranty on ram, and ram can go bad. Shop around for  
AppleCare, because you can get this below Apple's list price, and you  
don't need to buy it from the same place you buy the computer.

Finally, if you are affiliated with a school, you can save money by  
buying from Apple Store for Education. Some deals throw in an iPod.

I wish i was buying a new powerbook ;-)
