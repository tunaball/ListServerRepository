See, here Steve is posting information based on an actual  
investigation into the reality of the situation by the DOJ and you're  
just posting your opinion that they were completely wrong.

Yes, but they have been bombarded by Microsoft's illegally  
accomplished monopoly before they walk in the door.

Which is probably always what it will take for people to &quot;get&quot; why  
the Mac is worth more.  And their pricing, while not as low as  
bargain basement PCs, are not completely out of line.


I would be interested to see what a true comparison of a Powerbook  
and a Lenovo machine would be.
