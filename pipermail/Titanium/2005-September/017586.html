Wasn't this exactly what was said about the transition from OS 9 to OS 
X?

Look, I don't pretend to have any inside information and I am certainly 
NOT a computer wiz- I'm just a user. For me, the Mac is a tool and, 
from my perspective, a good one. I prefer it to a Windows environment, 
that much is certain. Do I particularly LOVE the notion that the Mac 
will be switching to Intel processors? Not really. But by the same 
token, I don't really give a rat's derriere as long as the overall 
platform continues to outshine its Windows competitors from a users 
point of view. And I understand that you are concerned about that being 
the case.
However, unless you truly believe that Steve, et al have decided to 
commit corporate suicide, it seems to me that it makes sense to let the 
process play out. Once it has, if you really think alternative 
platforms are superior, you will migrate in that direction. But the 
bulk of us good old general users don't care whether Intel, Motorola, 
IBM, or Frito Lays provides the chips as long as the overall system 
works in an &quot;Apple&quot; way.
We won't know the answer to that till there are products out there 
actually running the new processors. Till then, while concern about the 
readiness of applications is appropriate, it strikes me that much of 
the angst and apprehension about this is somewhat overstated.
Just my 4&#162; worth (with the price of gasoline in this part of the US 
going for over $3/gal, 2&#162; is no longer an option!)

&quot;When you come to the edge of all the light you know and are about to 
drop off into the darkness of the unknown, faith is knowing that one of 
two things will happen: There will be something solid to stand on or 
you will be taught how to fly.&quot;  -- Anonymous
