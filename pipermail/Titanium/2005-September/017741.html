</I>&gt;<i> Chris - first, thanks for that info about the Lenovo hZ60t Widescreen  
</I>&gt;<i> titanium notebook.  Pretty impressive, incredible price.
</I>&gt;<i> Although when I looked in detail at the site, I do not see much  
</I>&gt;<i> difference when we compare like with like/same specification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with your point about advertising.  Advertising and  
</I>&gt;<i> education, I think are needed.
</I>&gt;<i> If YOU think there is little advertising, and you are in the 'home  
</I>&gt;<i> country', imagine how it is elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here in Saudi Arabia, there is a new generation of Saudis who know  
</I>&gt;<i> practically nothing about Apple.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had one student, who in his spare time runs a computer shop, who  
</I>&gt;<i> asked me what my laptop was.  I said look at the (Apple) logo.  It  
</I>&gt;<i> meant nothing to hin !  I have only found one student at the College  
</I>&gt;<i> who has an iPod, and 1 member of staff.  iPod is unknown to more than  
</I>&gt;<i> 99.9% of the people.  Only the Media Centre have a (G5) Mac for  
</I>&gt;<i> publishing work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A junior staff member came to me the other day and said he wanted  
</I>&gt;<i> some advice about buying a laptop.  He showed me a price list with a  
</I>&gt;<i> Dell 15..4&quot; screen and all the bells and whistles (Bluetooth,  
</I>&gt;<i> wireless, long battery life) for at least $700 cheaper than the  
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent Powerbook.  I could muster no arguments as to why this was  
</I>&gt;<i> not the best option for him.
</I>&gt;<i> I was in the IT Department this week at the College and looked at  
</I>&gt;<i> their standard textbook on &quot;Operating Systems&quot;.  Not even a mention  
</I>&gt;<i> of Apple or Mac anywhere.  Talk about monopoly !  Most people here (&gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> 99%) don't even know there is a choice or an alternative.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I come somewhat reluctantly to the same conclusions as you, that  
</I>&gt;<i> more advertising and communication is need (bring back the  
</I>&gt;<i> evangelists), serious re-design is needed to cut out costs, margins  
</I>&gt;<i> have to move down, prices have to move down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Lenovo machine may have broken the paradigm of cheap and nasty.   
</I>&gt;<i> Well designed and cheap seems a new market segment that previously  
</I>&gt;<i> never exised.  I predict it is on a growth track.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that it is unrealistic to expect that Mac-OSX-for-Intel will  
</I>&gt;<i> stay on Apple hardware.  I believe that there will be a huge driving  
</I>&gt;<i> force to make it run on 1/2 price (Dell, Lenovo) laptops.  This force  
</I>&gt;<i> will at least activate hackers, but probably will be strong enough to  
</I>&gt;<i> drive Apple policy, even if reluctantly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are at a very interesting juncture in the development of the  
</I>&gt;<i> laptop.  In my recent proposals for a new building (2y out) at the  
</I>&gt;<i> College, I wrote that all staff should have wireless  laptops.  More  
</I>&gt;<i> than half the desk-space in every office here is taken over with huge  
</I>&gt;<i> ugly old CRT monitors, big boxes, thick cables and clunky keyboards  
</I>&gt;<i> (all this from new HP/Compaq PCs running XP).  My laptop is the same  
</I>&gt;<i> screen size, far better resolution and only a tiny footprint, and a  
</I>&gt;<i> pleasure to work with.  But will those laptops be Macs or Lenovo ?   
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Myself, I know that I could not achieve the productivity I have with  
</I>&gt;<i> my Al-book, Mac OS X and Keynote&#174; with a cheap PC laptop.
</I>&gt;<i> How much is it worth to me?  Probably a lot.  But for those who are  
</I>&gt;<i> not power-users?  Maybe the advantages are worth much less, and the  
</I>&gt;<i> new well-designed-and-cheap laptop may scoop some people.
</I>&gt;<i>
