Hi there :-)

Now, is that &quot;M&quot; - Michael, Mark or...?

Anyways - I appreciate your comment.  Now on to the issue itself:

For most folks, a Powerbook purchase represents a sizable investment - 
and hence their expectations that it will remain usable (current) for 
several years and that it will also be defect-free for that length of 
time. For most, a 2003 laptop is not archaic!

Now - while I did experience the boiling paint on the Ti 800 MHz, and 
nothing more than that, others have not fared as well. Too many others 
for me to ignore. We can look at this two ways: One - your way, as noted 
above (and it does have its merits) TWO - assume that I was simply 
lucky, and that many, TOO many, others have gotten &quot;rotten Apples&quot;.

Best,

Henry
