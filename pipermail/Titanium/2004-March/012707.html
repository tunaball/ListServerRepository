<PRE>Well, not completely off topic as you will see.

Much is being said about the recently concluded Academy Awards. 
However, Billy Crystal wasn't quite right when he said there wasn't 
anyone in New Zealand left to thank.

For those who have watched the &quot;Return of the King,&quot; and sat through 
the credits, will have noticed a member of this list among those 
mentioned. Glenn Anderson from Auckland is there for his Mac support.

What has that got to do with this list you ask? in late March or 
early April of 2001 Apple served up a hardware upgrade for the newly 
released Titanium. For many that tried on that upgrade ring their RAM 
memory simply disappear. It was Glenn who road to the rescue with a 
simple DIMM Check program to determine if your memory was affected. 
He also wrote the patch to bring back the dead memory.

Glenn did this for FREE.

No doubt Glenn's fine support and work with &quot;The Lord of the Ring&quot; 
series contributed to the movie's recent success in sweeping 11 out 
of 11 nominations.

For the Titanium list Glenn is our Academy Award winner. And, one 
more person in New Zealand to thank.
