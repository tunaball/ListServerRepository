Bill - I bought an Epson Colour Stylus 800 printer in 1997 to use 
with my Powerbook 3400c, and until late last year it was going very 
well, but then I lost the colour printing.
Probably something to do with clogging of the colour head.
I could not fix it myself.

I thought that this was a fair 'life' for a normal printer.

I was very happy with the Epson printer quality.

The problem that the failure caused me, is that there is no longer an 
Epson printer that will connect to the printer port on my 3400c which 
my wife uses at home.  So she can no longer print anything out.
All printers now are USB.

I also have an HP 950C inkjet printer which is also very good but the 
cartridges are just way too expensive.

Right now I have an HP Laserjet 1300 which is good quality, fast but only B&amp;W.

I will certainly get another Epson printer, for colour work, probably soon.

Trevor
