I'm not sure you deserve any more help when leaving out such vital 
information when asking. :-)

It would have been smart to leave the CD in until you had the external 
screen working, but done is done I guess.

As I see it you now have to be able to know exactly what is on the 
harddisk and after restart follow this procedure:

1. Push the first letter of the HD. If it is Mac HD you pick M. Then 
the commandkey-O which will open the disk.

2. Now you need to make certain that the letter you push will take you 
to the System Folder. You will have to type Sys in very quick 
succession if you think there might be any other file or folders 
starting with S.

3. When you believe you have System marked you'll hold down both 
option- and command-key and then O f&#246;r Open. This will leave only the 
System folder open.

4. Now you have to be certain you can get to the Preference folder in 
the same manner as under point 2 (I guess it is Preferences. It is 
called something different in my language :-)

5. Option-Command-open that folder to (The option is there to close the 
previous window)

6. Once again you have to push the keys to reach the Monitor in the 
Preference folder and option-command-O that as well.

7 The namelist of the Monitor Window will be situated roughly three 
third of the screen down and in the centre   and to get there will be 
the _real_ task. (This is why you have closed the other windows with 
options so you can't make any of them active by misstake)

8. You have to figure out by moving the mouse on the good screen how 
long horisontell movements you will have to do on the trackpad to get 
to the centre of screen and in the same manner how many vertical to get 
down on third.

9. Now you will move the mousepointer exactly just out of the good 
screen and repeat what you found out in point 8.

10. When you think you are in the right spot, hold the shift key down, 
press the mousebutton and move the Monitor window to the good screen. 
If it doesn't show up you have to move the mouse pointer back again and 
change it's position slightly higher or lower and try again. (The 
reason for the shift key is so that you will make each test in a 
straight line so you can alter the hight 5 mm at a time and try again.)

Good Luck you'll need it. :-) I have done the exercise on my own 
computer, covering the screen so it is possible, but not easy.
