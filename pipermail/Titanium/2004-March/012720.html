<PRE>Boy, do I have a list of ideas for you...  In order of easiest to 
hardest, probably, obvious stuff first that you've already tried, 
undoubtedly

Hold the eject key for about a second
Unmount the drive with Command-E or drag it to the trash (obviously not 
applicable in your case...)
Press the Eject button in iTunes
Press the force-eject button, only present on DVD-ROM drives (eg not 
combo or superdrives), on the right side of the drive.
If it's stuck in the drive because the OS thinks it's &quot;in use,&quot; try my 
force eject utility, Ejection Seat, at 
&lt;<A HREF="http://webpages.charter.net/remsoftware/util-scripts.html#eject">http://webpages.charter.net/remsoftware/util-scripts.html#eject</A>&gt;.  
This has been of zero use to me since about 10.2 or 10.3 since Apple 
fixed some bugs, but it can force a disk out (or tell you what 
application is using a disk).  Not for use with disk images or 
non-ejectable media, may require you to reboot to regain functionality 
of your optical drive, and hasn't really been tested under 10.3.  On 
the bright side, it shouldn't be able to do any damage, it's free, and 
it can get a disc out of your drive if you just want to get it out.

Reboot while holding down the trackpad button
Reboot while holding down the eject button
Reboot and hold down Command-Option-O-F to boot into open firmware; 
Type &quot;eject cd&quot; and press return. Then type mac-boot to boot after it 
has ejected, or shut-down to turn the computer off.
Open up the case and remove the drive; you can get CDs out in several 
ways.  One (best if you don't care whether your disc gets scratched or 
not) is to insert a mostly straightened paper clip, or something else 
that is long with a hook at the end, and try and hook either the back 
or the middle of the CD.  You can also try needlenose pliers to pull on 
the near edge of the disc.  The other way is to remove the screws on 
the drive until you can get the covers off and pop the disc out, then 
hope that when you put everything back together it still works.  Either 
way could damage your drive, but if the earlier steps didn't eject the 
disc, it's very likely that the drive is broken anyway (unless of 
course it was a non-standard disc-not circular, or, except for the 
early PBG4's DVD-ROM drive, a mini-CD is also considered non-standard; 
those aren't supposed to be used in the slot loading drives)
