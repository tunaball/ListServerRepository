<PRE>Andy Axton has stated:

&quot;I've been looking all over the place for a decent PowerBook forum, and
finally I found this list (which I'm guessing must be good if one of
Apple's &quot;co-founders&quot; is subscribed).&quot;

While it is true that Steve Wozniak contributes to this list, so do many other talented and wonderful people from various places in the world.  It is a terrific list, and I would not have purchased my Ti 800 in May without the help and advice of those on this list.  Thanks to all.

Andy asked:

&quot;[C]ould you briefly let me know if you have reason to believe that the
'paint/delamination and wear issues' and/or the 'keyboard/frame
screen-scratching issues' were fixed or remedied after a certain [the
latest?] revision?&quot;

I thought they had been remedied by the end of May, 2002, but found paint &quot;bubbling&quot; on the light-gray &quot;frame&quot; of the Ti.  I notified Apple, and they too thought the problem was fixed; the Ti went to Houston and was back the next day; and two parts were replaced and it is perfect again.  Apple is responding these days, thank God.

Then Andy asked:

&quot;Any rough ideas on average 'dead pixel' counts for recent-model TiBooks?&quot;

I took a Windows/PC computer friend to the Apple Store when I bought it, and we checked the Ti carefully for this issue, and found it was a nonissue.  Check with care, and have it fixed if there are any problems.

Also, Andy asked:

&quot;Do you guys have any good recommendations/tips for preventing potential
common cosmetic (or other significant) TiBook issues?&quot;

Treat it with care; it's an expensive machine that is worthy of such care.

Good luck, and hopefully you enjoy it as much as I do mine.
