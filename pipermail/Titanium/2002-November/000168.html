The above is not correct.

When interacting with biological materials, microwaves spread their 
effects over a constant volume, regardless of power level. Basically, 
they penetrate by a certain distance into water-bearing materials. 
That's why a microwave oven heats a baked potato from the inside.  If 
you reduce the power, you are still spreading that reduced power over 
the same volume, so you're reducing the rate of energy deposition 
into any given cell.  You are _not_ increasing, or even keeping 
constant, the heating of surface cells.

&quot;Square wave&quot; and &quot;digital&quot; microwave signals are still GHz sine 
waves.  They are just turned on and off at some rate to modulate 
them.  Biological heating is done by the total power, and modulation 
only reduces that.

A &quot;digital audio amplifier&quot; is actually a switching amplifier.  That 
can cause it to reject less energy as heat, but it will produce the 
same energy in the outgoing signal.  For a given amount of sound 
output, a speaker will receive the same power from any type of 
amplifier. The type of electronics does not significantly effect the 
radiated power from a card that is deliberately radiating a signal.

As to resonance of a microwave signal with part of the cells:  That 
resonance is already well-tuned in a microwave oven.  They are 
effective because they efficiently excite the water-bond resonance; 
their frequency is chosen for that.  Phones, laptops and other 
devices that work at different frequencies are _less_ effective at 
coupling their energy into biological material, not more.
