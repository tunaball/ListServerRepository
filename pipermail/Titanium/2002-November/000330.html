<PRE>
&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I had the same nervousness at first, however I bit the bullet and simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installed Jaguar as is on my existing PB over 9.2.2. It went smooth as could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be, and took about 45 minutes at most.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would certainly recommend a clean install, letting Jaguar do the HD
</I>&gt;<i> format. This seems to be the best road for upgrade from 10.x.x and is
</I>&gt;<i> clearly outlined in the install manual for an upgrade from OS9.x.x
</I>
I too was a little nervous... So... I backed up everything on all 5
partitions (a mistake, but I've lived with it), and had Jaguar reformat the
drive into two partitions (a 42Gb one and 2.5Gb for an emergency untouched
version of Jaguar). I'm currently running 10.2.2 with no problems at all
(and stability is stunning over what I had with 9.2.1). I've never had a
crash since I installed (yes, occasionally some apps crash, and rather than
restarting like I used to, I simply restart the application). I've been able
to find drivers for my Epson photo printer, my scanner, and other external
devices.

I run the full Office suite, GoLive, PhotoShop and quite a few other
applications on Jaguar with no 9.x installed anywhere. Occasionally an
installer wants Classic, but I generally try to find an OS-X compatible
replacement for this software.

You mentioned that you were in the middle of writing a brief... I would wait
until you are done. It took me a couple days to reformat, install the OS,
Install all the Apps, and get everything configured the way I wanted....
