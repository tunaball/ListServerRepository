&quot;Yes I do have a HP printer! Is there any work around that
anyone is 
aware of?&quot;

hi erwin,

www.macintouch.com is a good place to look for mac os x info.
the following is from that site:

&quot;Steve Kennedy reports success with a tip from our Mac OS X
&quot;Jaguar&quot; report for resolving a nasty problem with Mac OS
10.2.2:

    Jerry Ethington's solution to the &quot;HP Slowdown&quot; worked for
me, too.
      I had installed the latest version of the HP driver for
the Photosmart p1100 on top of a fresh Jaguar system. First
time that computer had ever seen an HP driver, and the slowdown
was horrible. Mouse movement was jerky, and dragging an item
didn't happen in realtime. Funny though, Process Viewer didn't
show HP Communications taking up an astronomical amount of CPU
time, 6% or so. This is on a FP iMac 600.
      Restarting with the Command-Option-P-R keys held down
fixed the problem completely. Printing works fine in all apps
and the system response is back to normal. Thanks! 

Tyler Blessing notes an alternative printer driver for HP
devices and Mac OS X:

    HPIJS 1.3, a free, open source printer driver is now
available prepackaged for Mac OS X Jaguar (10.2 and higher) and
Darwin (6.0 and higher). This driver supports 212 printers
(Apollo, HP DeskJet, LaserJet, OfficeJet,Business Inkjet,
Mopier, PSC, PhotoSmart and more) and uses the open-source
Foomatic printing system in combination with ESP Ghostscript,
an open-source PostScript interpreter, and CUPS, the built-in
printing spooler in Mac OS X Jaguar. [...]
      For most supported printers, this driver produces output
quality equivalent to the drivers supplied by HP. In photo
mode, with photo paper, the output quality is very high,
especially for the HP DeskJet 990C and later models, which
auto-detect the paper type in hardware. Photo printing is fully
supported in the newer 6- and 7-ink models.
      For many of the supported printers, HPIJS is the only
driver available for Mac OS X. A major advantage of using this
driver over those supplied by HP is the direct interface
between HPIJS and the native CUPS spooler, which allows
printing from any printer over any available connection such as
USB, AppleTalk, TCP/IP (via LPD and IPP), HP JetDirect, and
shared windows printers via SAMBA. Additionally, this driver
utilizes the existing Mac OS X USB &quot;backend&quot; and thus does not
install any software that might interfere with standard USB
operation.&quot;

best wishes,
will
