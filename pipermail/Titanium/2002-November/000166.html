<PRE>Last time I heard (which was probably about a year or two ago), there 
wasn't any increase in the rate of brain tumors; however, it was found 
that people who both used cell phones and got brain tumors were more 
likely to get a tumor on the side of the brain nearest to where they 
usually held the phone.  Maybe that's just because the phone gravitates 
towards the stupider side of the head, though.  ;-)

Anyway, I never saw the original message, and I can't find it in the 
archive; methinks the digest missed a few things, because I got nothing 
between about 6 PM on the 21st and about 12:40 AM today (the 23rd), and 
I'm not missing a digest in between there...  But, FWIW, the Airport 
Base Station (which I would imagine to be the stronger of the base 
station versus the computer) has a total power output of about 32 mW: 
that's about 1/30 of one Watt.  There are about 15 billion things 
you're exposing yourself to every day that are stronger and more 
harmful to you, so I'm not particularly worried about it.

Also, it should be noted that while we may not know everything about 
electromagnetic radiation, often there is little we can do about it, 
especially the parts of the EM spectrum that could be more harmful due 
to their higher energy and that we know less about.  Cosmic rays are 
going straight through us; they even plow straight through the earth.  
For that matter, so are many other things, such as neutrinos.  
Fortunately, on average, only one neutrino will interact with your body 
over your entire life; the rest will pass straight through and you'll 
never notice them.  What damage that one neutrino might cause is 
totally unknown; they can't really be stopped.  In fact, one of my 
former professors is part of a project to build a huge neutrino 
detector, which actually looks *through* the Earth, trying to catch a 
neutrino or two as it's passing out of the earth.
