cellular potentials being RF inside of cells?  Do normal healthy human 
cells generally emit or naturally contain RF?  It seems like you are 
saying that cells somehow generate / broadcast RF GREATER than that of 
the cellphone... ??  Potential?

&gt;<i> and more than a factor of 500 smaller than the fluctuations in those 
</I>&gt;<i> potentials due to living at room temperature.
</I>
does room temperature create a state wherein RF is less stable?  The 
potential from the cells?  What would be a good source for me to read 
about the cellular potentials of which you specifically mentioned?

&gt;<i> So &quot;it doesn't take much&quot;, but the effects being talked about in this 
</I>&gt;<i> thread are very, very, very too small to be considered enough.
</I>
the 'effects' of the electronics in Ti books is EASILY felt by anyone 
who's willing to stop by my place and rest their finger on my Ti book's 
chassis...  If the 'potential' of the battery (which is enough to kill 
you if attached to you heart) is being converted into other forms and 
or states of energy (and dissipating in 2 hours or less) - are we 
saying that &quot;there is NO MEASURABLE  affect on one's health&quot;?  and are 
we stating it as an indisputable fact?  And are we saying that we 
understand the phenomenon life to the degree that we can state, as 
indisputable fact, that the RF in mobile electronics etc. have ONLY 
positive, beneficial, or neutral effects, with NO adverse affects 
whatsoever?

&gt;<i> A good place to start is to actually study the scientific literature 
</I>&gt;<i> on this.
</I>
Suggestions?

&gt;<i> What you'll find is that most of the popular statements are known to 
</I>&gt;<i> be over-wrought to the point of fear-mongering.
</I>
sometimes statements are just stated as conceptual conversational 
possibilities and sometimes the fearful blow things out of proportion...

my original questions:

my question would be - Is the 'heat' purely radiated infrared [thermal] 
heat?  os does the computer emit any radio frequency waves of a high 
enough power to cause cumulative disruption of normal cellular 
functioning after considerably long exposure?  after all - don't 
microwave ovens use high frequency electro-magnetic waves to cook food?

unquestionably have no more significance in 300 years than laptops and 
cellphones themselves)
