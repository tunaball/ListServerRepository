<PRE>HI Trev, depends what the laptop is to be used for I suppose.

MY friend who ws until 6 days ago a dedicated PC user of a long time 
asked me to price him a new laptop in Hong Kong. Yep so I waled around 
and called him. He was ready to spill the cash at about $USD2500 on the 
usual brands. I asked him what he wanted to use the machine for...He 
responded with the usual &quot;MS OFFICE, EMAIL, INTERNET, MP# DIGITAL CAM 
and PSHOP' response.

I said try a MAC. HE had a look at the ibook and called back and said 
&quot;get it!'.

HIs requirements were met by what he got for a mere $USD1.8K optioned 
up with software. Cheap and faster on the floor with te usual apps and 
very stable indeed.

HE called to tell me about the apple switch adds which I had no idea 
about. I guess he switched.

He also has VPC for WINDOWS, XP, NT and WIN98 that he thought he would 
need. I guess he wasted his money.

HE has DAVE 4.0 so he walks straight in to his office and hooked  up 
with the RJ45 and voila -instantly connected to a Microsoft network.

He plugs the cheap DV cam in and get instant d/ling of his snaps and 
can share the, with iphoto on the net.

HE wanted to know where all the DRIVERS were kept and all the usual 
specialisation software needed for a sloppy windows system. I said 
there is none.

He was worried about learing the OS X interface.. that was a few days 
ago.. I haven't heard from him since...

you got the idea?

BTW, I have WINDOWS <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">XP at SP1</A> running in the background here to get my 
work emails. It is slow to boot (even under CLASSIC VPC) but I need it 
because of compatible firewalls and junk like this.

depends on your requirements.

check out Ellen Feiss on the switch add. It says it all .
