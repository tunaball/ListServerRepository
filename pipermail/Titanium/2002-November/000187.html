That doesn't mean much.  Maybe that's because we tend to live longer 
now than we used to, and the chance of cells turning cancerous (and 
being the cause of a person's death) is greater as we age, causing an 
increased rate of cancer (assuming that's true, of course), and it is 
in fact totally unrelated to any increase in bad conditions, but rather 
an increase in *good* conditions in our daily lives.
You really have to think hard about what details any statistic leaves 
out; there are always a number of points in anything where the 
statistic is flawed.

&gt;<i> I know that before i bought my ear-piece, i could talk about 7 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> before the heat, sweat, and thought coherency-reduction would start to
</I>&gt;<i> set in...
</I>&gt;<i> by ten minutes - uber headache on the phone-side of the head...
</I>
Was that caused by the phone's radiation as you seem to imply, or 
perhaps by the tonal quality of the phone's speaker?  Or maybe the 
difference in position between holding a phone to your ear and using an 
earpiece?
I'm just having fun playing devil's advocate here, trying to encourage 
everybody to think about what may be presented to them as &quot;facts&quot; or 
&quot;strong evidence&quot; of something; and I'm really thinking in a bigger 
picture than just this discussion.  Correlation does not imply 
causation.
And for a good laugh...
