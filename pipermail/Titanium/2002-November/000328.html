<PRE>
Many thanks for your helpful comments.  Just what I was looking for.

My colleagues are using their laptops at a basic business level - 
much like your friend: documents, images, email, internet.  Not mp3.

So maybe an iBook instead of a TiBook would suit them, as well.

Where in HK did you buy it ? Designer Group Company ?

regards,  Trevor

HI Trev, depends what the laptop is to be used for I suppose.

MY friend who ws until 6 days ago a dedicated PC user of a long time 
asked me to price him a new laptop in Hong Kong. Yep so I waled 
around and called him. He was ready to spill the cash at about 
$USD2500 on the usual brands. I asked him what he wanted to use the 
machine for...He responded with the usual &quot;MS OFFICE, EMAIL, 
INTERNET, MP# DIGITAL CAM and PSHOP' response.

I said try a MAC. HE had a look at the ibook and called back and said 
&quot;get it!'.

HIs requirements were met by what he got for a mere $USD1.8K optioned 
up with software. Cheap and faster on the floor with te usual apps 
and very stable indeed.

HE called to tell me about the apple switch adds which I had no idea 
about. I guess he switched.

He also has VPC for WINDOWS, XP, NT and WIN98 that he thought he 
would need. I guess he wasted his money.

HE has DAVE 4.0 so he walks straight in to his office and hooked  up 
with the RJ45 and voila -instantly connected to a Microsoft network.

He plugs the cheap DV cam in and get instant d/ling of his snaps and 
can share the, with iphoto on the net.

HE wanted to know where all the DRIVERS were kept and all the usual 
specialisation software needed for a sloppy windows system. I said 
there is none.

He was worried about learing the OS X interface.. that was a few days 
ago.. I haven't heard from him since...
