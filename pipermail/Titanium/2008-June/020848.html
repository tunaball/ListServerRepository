You should have a minimum of ten percent free on your boot disk to  
avoid slowdowns.

No. I have one of the G4 iBooks that was proven to have a  
manufacturing defect. No way to get the money back without a court or  
other legally binding order. I also have a MacBook that died from a  
know defect - random shutdowns. It was fixed, but the fix also died in  
the same way after the guarantee period. Didn't even try to get any  
help on that.

Apple has taken to lying to its customers and producing products of a  
lower quality.

The first to be hit by sleazy tactics were small dealers who helped  
Apple get thru the hard times - they have been cut off.
The small user of servers is now being screwed. If you don't have  
$6,000/yr for a service contract, to bad.

A comment to the Server List:

The Mac interface died with OS9. Mac OS X is like an old version of  
Windows - a nice GUI that generates a command (line). (Of course,  
nothing could be as bad as Windows.) The iPod is the new Apple  
interface, and eventually it will not be worth retrofitting to the  
current Birth Defect. (People are already reporting they can do biz  
while traveling with only the iPhone.) Of course, this is of little  
concern for a Server, but that will long gone by the time Apple  
finally destroys its remaining Good Will by axing the client, while  
continuing to claim, &quot;It just works&quot;. But hey, what can we expect?  
Without cashing out the Good Will, shareholders would end up short  
changed.

PS: I have a thread from the Server List that covers the topic, if  
anyone wants it.
