<PRE>According to John Griffin:

&gt;<i>To be quite honest, I had no idea that I was doing anything wrong by
</I>&gt;<i>downloading this file until I asked about the Forms Autocomplete feature.
</I>&gt;<i>Had I not asked the question, I (and probably hundreds of others) would
</I>&gt;<i>probably still be basking in complete innocence - which is why I said I am
</I>&gt;<i>glad I started the thread. At least I know where I stand.
</I>
Yes. You and I, and countless other 'perpetrators' and 
ne'er-do-wells, have come face to face with that sweet morphing of 
the Age of Puritanism meets 1930's Germany, also known as the New 
American Empire.

It, like Wagner's music, is way better than it sounds, honest. Once 
you understand the equation between innocently asking about an 
unimplemented feature of a beta version of soon-to-be-released 'free' 
software, and being part of an uncouth horde of pirates seeking other 
people's belongings and mass-emailing poor old little companies with 
'thousands' of complaints , it'll all seem like business as usual.

I too, read about the developments in safari, on the /. site, and 
thought, &quot;Gee, swell, what about the Finder and delayed mouse=downs 
in windows and desktop?&quot; It was only later that I  realized that a 
developer [a real one, not a pay-to-play one] had inadvertently sent 
me the pkg along his own stuff that I test. With six browsers on 
board, I'm not all the way ready to run into traffic head-on with 
shouts of hallelujah over a minor innovation/'upgrade' to an 'old' 
feature.

I had decided to comment as little as possible, for the exact same 
reason you stated: &lt;paraphrased&gt; It's not fair to the others who 
might have innocent curiosity, especially with so many saintly types, 
waiting in the wings, for the arrival of someone who has something 
they One, Either don't have, or Two, Have, but have agreed not to 
discuss.

I used a serialed-out copy of Thoth for a year before I realized it 
wasn't a free app. &lt;Laughs&gt; So, I paid for it. My ethics dictate that 
if I use something, I pay for it. Period. I sent in my fee. [One of 
the best 20 or 30 bucks I ever spent by the way] and had attached a 
note to Brian Clark saying I'd used it for a long time and was paying 
because it was so great. He sent back the same thing to me that he 
sends to everyone, &quot;Thanks for buying Thoth&quot;. Now, in that previous 
year I had advocated for, and enabled the sale of, many copies of 
Thoth, based on my experience with it. To an absolutist that makes no 
difference, it was theft. To a relativist, it was no-brainer, 
positive outcome, AND process, for the author/developer.

I assumed, of course, that I was probably on a lower-tier of the 
registered users of Thoth. But guess what? Six months later i wrote 
to Thoth support [had no idea if <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">support at thothsw.com</A> even existed], 
and,by chance, Brian Clark happened to be checking the mail, and he 
sent me back [within all of 3 minutes] the longest, well-thought out 
explanation for the feature/oddity, his outlook on the future of 
Thoth, and how he'd built in code that wasn't enabled yet, AND, of 
course, he thanked me again, for being a Thoth user, as well as 
taking MY time to write in with a question.

And that, my friend, is the Macintosh way... albeit, third-party 
style. I've been an Apple user/buyer/advocate since before the Mac, 
when I worked at HP back in the mid-late 70s, and I've never called 
Apple support even once. They owe me nothing. I'm happy. But do I 
occasionally evaluate software before trashing it, or buying it? Hell 
yes. A 'trial' version is more often than not, crippled in some way, 
it would be similar to buying a car based on a drive around the lot, 
or a house without being able to have it inspected for 'hidden', 
serious flaws. I won't profit off someone else's work, without paying 
for it, but neither will I shell out hard-earned cash on faith alone. 
There's a middle ground between being a criminal and a fool, at least 
there used to be.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>By the way, I still haven't discovered how to use the Forms AutoComplete,
</I>&gt;<i>but I have kinda forgotten about it...
</I>
It isn't implemented in the beta.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>BTW: You might be interested to know that Gordon Burns has written a new
</I>&gt;<i>version of Safari Enhancer just for v.62.
