I don't know about Sierra Wireless, but there's been a thread on the 
PowerList over the past week about the Novatel Merlin C201 card and 
SprintPCS on TiBooks. That thread referenced a link on powerpage.org 
from November, and a more recent one from the past couple of weeks.

I bought the Merlin card on Saturday, for $179. I selected the PCS 
Vision (1XRTT) unlimited data plan for $100/month, and they instantly 
rebated me the cost of the card. I only had to pay about $10 in sales 
tax. Other plans are $40 for 20MB, $60 for 40MB, and $80 for 70MB. I 
downloaded ~35MB and uploaded ~5MB today, using a custom business app 
while testing reception and performance at my job site.

You have to &quot;provision&quot; the card in a Windows 98 (or newer) laptop - 
VPC doesn't support the PC card slot. &quot;Provisioning&quot; entails loading 
some of your account settings into the card itself, and you have to 
connect successfully at least once from the Windows laptop. I did this 
on a display laptop yesterday at Circuit City (with permission).

After that, there's a Novatel modem script you can install on the 
TiBook (10.2 and up) and then use Internet Connect to log on. I spent 
most of the day at work today connected via SprintPCS, using the 
connection as described above.

Unlike the Aircard's pictured at the Sierra Wireless site, the Merlin 
doesn't have a little folding antenna. It looks just like some of the 
802.11b PC cards, with just a little black stub sticking out the side 
of PC card slot.

Email me if you want any of the links.

Mark
