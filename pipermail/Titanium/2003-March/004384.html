<PRE>Harsh? Not at all... would saying that I can't open an organic synthesis
molecular- simulation site have met with your approval...rather
than the &quot;lowly Backgammon&quot;? 

So - let me &quot;bleat again&quot; and try to focus on the problem at haind:

The issue is that updating OS-X's Java has cause a further  malfunction
and that an earlier installation of NN 7.0.1 in an OS-10.2 &quot;environment&quot;
has caused a previously perfectly functioning IE 5.2 to crash when dealing
with a Java-intensive site. 

Now, my assumption is that this has to do with the operating system, since
reinstalling the IE 5.2 did nothing to rectify the situation. Also -
removing the prefs did not help.

The diagnostic/repair tools currently available for OS-X seem (to me) less
competent than the ones for OS 9 (and the preceding versions). OS-X, on
the other hand, seems (to me) more complex (with invisible files etc) and 
less amendable to the techniques and &quot;tinkering&quot; methods I was able to use
when working with OS-9 (such as keeping
&quot;canned recent versions&quot; on an ext HD and simply copying them to the Int
HD to get a working OS when all else fails).

I hope this has clarified my concerns.

If you have any specific suggestions for this case - I'd be most grateful
to you as well as happy to try them out and report back to the list.

Best,

Henry

I don't mind helping out with issues due to the new OS but keep the rants down about how there is something inherently wrong with the OS just because it's unfamiliar to you.
