<PRE>Mal, just interested in why you want this... you have a reason .

Somethings that come to mind are:

1) costly and not financially practical but good!: use a shared disk 
array with RORKE DATA SANimage with shared partitions.. needs some FC 
HBA's too. not for you I think but mention it. This would give you a 
SINGLE image shared between two or more machines.. very costly in a 
sense. no need to synchronise AND you would have the benefit of a RAID5 
or some similar rotating parity disk array... .. as 'instant' as you 
could get where both machines could UPDATE at the file level (data 
level locking)..

2) more practical--&gt; ON a use a backup/recovery application like DANTZ 
&quot;retrospect&quot;.It would be awkward to this because both macs would be in 
use and there would have to be some 'arrangement' between each about 
WHO was the 'production'. machine and who had the synchronisation of 
the catlg.

MOvement of the data over the GbE would be heavy depending on the 
frequency or interval of synchronisation you wanted ... 'instant?&quot;.. 
hope not! (lol).

You could rely on the software to do this when it was time. But i think 
you will need apple script or some method to schedule at the 
interval/frequqncy you want to keep the machines in synch.

As most of us in the IT world have experienced, applications are locked 
out while b/r apps do their stuff, for reasons of 'p.o.c.' and 
serialisation.... so maybe some annoyance for you while this happens 
around your feet while you work!

3)  do it your self with apple scripts and 'cp' commands or 'drag and 
drop&quot; + mistakes I'd image.

It could be done with scripts and some thought.

WHEN do moth machines have to be in SYNCH? Instantly? or a at each hour.

interested in what others think.

fwiw
