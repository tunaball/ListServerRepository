<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm wondering why you have the ATI Monitor in Login Items. never heard 
</I>&gt;<i> of that before. My copy is in the ATI Utilities folder in 
</I>&gt;<i> Applications/Utilities. Does it actually launch and do anything?
</I>
I have no clue. I downloaded the ATI utilities a while back (when it 
came out for the PB). This December break, I was looking to clean up my 
system, and noticed the ATI folder in the Utilities folder. I double 
clicked on one of the icons - bad choice - it installed a bunch of 
files. My impressions was that I had already done this when I 
downloaded the installer. Top and Process Viewer do not show an ATI 
process (at least that I can discern). I also clicked on the program 
icons to see what they did. Normally I figure out what something is 
before double clicking on it.

&gt;<i> Also, what 'latest video update are you referring to?
</I>
ATI came out with an update for the PB's, etc...

&gt;<i> The i GB of 'free' disk space isn't enough. The OS likes at least 20% 
</I>&gt;<i> free, preferably contiguous [i.e. non-fragmented] space to work with, 
</I>&gt;<i> and Photoshop likes a 'fat' 'scratch' folder, or space, also.
</I>
I know : (

&gt;<i> My suggestions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1- Off-load enough files, applications, or whatever, to bring the free 
</I>&gt;<i> disk space to at least 20% of the total drive.
</I>
Will do. I have had a 120GB Western Digital HD for a few weeks now, and 
have that ability finally...although I moved 4 gigs of files onto it 
just a few weeks ago!

&gt;<i> 2- Run the Disk Utility on the drive, from a separate partition, or 
</I>&gt;<i> the Install disk, if you have only one partition.
</I>
Ok, but what should I do? I ran fix permissions yesterday (for an 
unrelated problem).

&gt;<i> 3- Delete the ATI utility in your Login Items, and let it reside in 
</I>&gt;<i> the Utilities folder with the other ATI utilities.
</I>
Will do.

&gt;<i> 4- Optimize your drive, after making adequate space on it. Use Norton 
</I>&gt;<i> Speed Disk, or DiskWarrior Plus Optimizer, if you have the DW CD.
</I>
I have neither. Is their any good reason to do this? I have had next to 
no problems with my PB, although I do want to (eventually) offload 
everything and erase and fresh install my system, as I am running an 
&quot;Archive and Install&quot; of Jaguar. With all the SW I have to put back on 
my machine, this is not a very fun thing to do.


Thanks!
