I have the t68i, and a d-link type USB adapter.

What I want is a simple ?BT on? type switch, to work with this adapter on the pb.

I have the clicker, or at least had it till the new version came out, and thought it was great. Until then I thought the phone was pretty crappy, compared to the nokias I?ve had ? the delayed response makes it difficult to send SMSs, record numbers, wake from sleep ? and it?s a real hassle. The Isync is a bit of a joke- you can only update the calendar in the phone 8 weeks into the future. ( the sony ericsson software for a pc gives you full syncronisation, not restricted). It also doesn?t let you put street addresses on the phone. (compared to nokia/pc via infra-red, the syncronisation is very limited - an IR connection for a nokia to a pb would have been my preference)

I love the clicker, but the steps involved in setting up BT get me stumped every time. 

I insert the dlink thing, which sticks out the back (meaning I can?t leave it in place if I travel with the tibook, or even want to lock it away). I make the phone discoverable. I then switch BT on in the line in the top right hand corner of the screen. Nothing happens. I look to turn on the BT preferences in system preferences ? of course the pane isn?t there. So I have to find a way of getting it to appear, and the only way I can see is restart. ( Please help me here if I am missing something). 

Then I turn on Itunes, and use clicker- great, pausing and fast-forwarding to my heart's content.

Then, tired of so much fun, I turn in for the evening. It seems that I have to turn off BT at the top right of the screen, before closing the lid on the PB (the time that I didn?t, I got a warning that I hadn?t removed the device properly, and it being late at night, I didn?t bother writing it down).

So it seems to me clicker is a great app if you have a mac desktop, but not if you need to use your pb as a mobile computer. In order for it to be a real option for a mobile user, I think there would have to be a bt pcmcia card which could work on a pb (and so stay in place and so be &quot;on&quot; all the time), and looking at apple's bt forums, that does not seem to be on the horizon. And if clicker didn?t exist, I wouldn?t recommend a T68.

(However the PB/t68 combination does work fine as a bluetooth modem (haven?t tried gprs))
