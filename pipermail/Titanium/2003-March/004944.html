<PRE>According to Daniel Borge:

&gt;<i>But what is weird is that I thought the second screen mirrored the 
</I>&gt;<i>primary screen
</I>&gt;<i>(my laptop) as Flipper explained.
</I>&gt;<i>(btw, sorry for my bad translation, my jaguar is in norwegian)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So why then did my laptop screen (primary) show the second screens 
</I>&gt;<i>desktop picture when
</I>&gt;<i>mirroring was activated?
</I>
When you set your screens for split/spanned, which screen has the 
menu bar? If it's the bigger, external monitor, then the laptop will 
use that as its own screen, if mirroring, or spanned screens are off. 
in other words, if you unplug the external monitor, the laptop will 
display whichever screen was last set for main, or Menu bar, screen.

Check it out: Plug the external in, select Displays [not Desktop] in 
prefs, et the screens for NOT mirrored [uncheck the Mirror box if 
it's checked]. And then select, 'Arrangement'. You'll notice two 
little replicas of the screens. They'll be superimposed if Mirror is 
checked, so uncheck it. now you'll see the two screens, as replicas, 
and you can drag the little white bar from one to the other to 
determine which screen will have the menu bar on it. That screen is 
then your main screen. I f you want the PowerBook to display a 
certain desktop picture, when there is NO external monitor, then you 
have to select that picture on your 'main' screen in the arrangements 
window.

Main does not refer to the builtin screen, it only refers to 
whichever of the two screens you've decided to have the menu bar on 
when both monitors are connected in spanned mode.

My external monitor is my 'main' screen. because it's about twice as 
large and a quantum jump in true-life color, etc, as well as being 
far easier on the eyes.So the picture on it, becomes the desktop 
picture on the laptop, whenever the external isn't connected, or when 
the two monitors are 'mirrored', which in my case is never.

If, for a crazy example, i had a rude picture on my Main, external, 
monitor [the one i have my menu bar on] i would accept that if i was 
on a plane, and started up the laptop, that would be the picture on 
my screen. period. Alternative is to put that sort of desktop pic on 
the non-menu screen, when the external is plugged in, and spanned 
desktops [not mirrored] are in effect.
