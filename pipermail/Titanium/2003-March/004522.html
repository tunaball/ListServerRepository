Subject: Re: &quot;mostly&quot; made on a Mac?

&gt;<i> John - I was quite perturbed to read the statement: 'mostly made on a 
</I>&gt;<i> mac' !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It suggests that there are parts that you could not make with a Mac.
</I>&gt;<i> If you meant that there were parts that you chose not to make on a 
</I>&gt;<i> Mac, you might want to word it differently (or am I too sensitive?)
</I>
Maybe a bit too sensitive. I mean, I am bilingual : ) I prefer macs 
over PC (I have a Ti!), but some stuff just won't run on a mac (Front 
Page, Access needs a PC or Virtual PC - VERY SLOW!).


&gt;<i> My observation is that <A HREF="http://www.ururk.com/portfolio">http://www.ururk.com/portfolio</A> would not load 
</I>&gt;<i> with Safari (v unstated).
</I>
try:

<A HREF="http://www.ururk.com/portfolio/index.html">http://www.ururk.com/portfolio/index.html</A>

The index page should automatically come up.

It should load in Safari (it loads for me) v60, Camino .7, Chimera .7, 
Netscape 7, IE 5.2.2. Also tested in OS 9. I have not tried Safari v64 
or v62.

On the PC front, IE 5, Netscape 4.7 (not completely - no Flash 6 
support), Netscape 6 or the latest version for the PC (I have no clue!).


&gt;<i> However, it would load with IE 5.2.2 ....
</I>&gt;<i> This suggests the presence of some M$T-specific stuff?
</I>
Not yet - I am going to add a database connection through MS Access in 
the near future. Perhaps I should put that on the pages that are 
created in Front Page. (actually, so far, the pages that will 
eventually support a form have been created 100% on a mac, in 
Dreamweaver MX - I will open those pages up, and add the database 
connection in Front Page).

Or I could add an addendum.


I just though, most sites say, &quot;Made with a Mac&quot;, or &quot;Made with a PC&quot;. 
I though it was kinda funny to say, &quot;Mostly made with a mac&quot;. Perhaps 
something like, &quot;Mostly made with a mac because MS didn't port MS 
Access over to the Mac Platform&quot;. Or, &quot;Made with a mac, including Front 
Page and Access in Virtual PC 6.0&quot;

I don't know CGI, perl, java, or ODBC, so I really need an easy and 
readymade solution for this type of thing.



Anyways, this is getting a bit off topic. As a side note, my Portfolio 
does have a place for &quot;stuff&quot;, and one of the subsections will include 
something mac/TiBook related. Definitely iPod related.
