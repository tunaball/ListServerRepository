<PRE>According to Chris Olson:

&gt;<i>This is the part I don't understand.  You got *two* windows xp drive 
</I>&gt;<i>images?  How did the config files get into the OS 9 Documents 
</I>&gt;<i>directory in the first place?  Or maybe you are mistaking the config 
</I>&gt;<i>file for the drive image.  Your drive image ends with a .vhdp 
</I>&gt;<i>extension.  The config file for that drive image ends with a .vpc6 
</I>&gt;<i>extension.  You need *both* those files to run your guest operating 
</I>&gt;<i>system.  Delete the file with the .vpc6 extension and you can 
</I>&gt;<i>recover from the situation.  Delete the file with the .vhdp 
</I>&gt;<i>extension and your guest operating system is toast.
</I>&gt;<i>--

Chris,

Thank you very much for your reply. I failed to mention I'm on VPC 5.0.4

I figured it out. There's no extensions on the Sparse drive Images. 
Nor is there a file with a .vhdp extension. This might be due to my 
setup. Be that as it may, after reading your letter, i went and 
looked very carefully at the files. They seemed exactly the same. I 
used File Buddy, with visibility on all to look at each one, and then 
it hit me....&lt;pause to feel dumb&gt;... the files looked identical, 
because the VirtualPC folder in the OSX partition...was an alias. And 
it was pointed at the my OS 9 Documents folder.

That's good news, except for the fact that trashing the OSX VPC 
folder will only give 8 kb of space rather than 4 GBs  &lt;laughs&gt;

Since you obviously are very familiar with the VPC app, I'm taking 
the liberty oof asking 2 more easier questions ['more' as in 
additional].

One- Did you use VPC 5 at some point and upgrade? and if so, did you 
trash the VPC 5 app?

Two- I'm curious what you think of Redhat Linux in VPC? I realize 
there's some performance gain in VPC 6, which I don't use, yet, but 
it's mostly screen redraw stuff from my limited experience testing 
VPC 6. Does Linux run pretty well on your setup?

Thanks again for getting me further into what  *was*  a messy bit of 
logic over here. it all makes sense now, for the time being.
