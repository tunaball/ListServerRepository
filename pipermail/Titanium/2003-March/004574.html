Did you actually see this work, or was someone just speculating that 
it would?  I would be surprised if it did.   It might work, but there 
are a couple of issues that I can foresee.

I don't know much about Cingular's GSM based system, but I do know a 
little about CDMA systems.  When a wireless phone acts as a modem in 
the circuit switched sense, it is not phone that is performing the 
modem function, but a modem in the fixed infrastructure side of the 
system.  So I wonder how the infrastructure on the terminating end of 
the call knows to be a modem?  It could be done, but I think that it 
would take extra work on the part of the system designers to support 
a function that they do not want people to use.

If this really works, I am interested in knowing details.

I don't know what Cingular's family plan costs, but for $99/month 
from Sprint or Verizon I can get packet data service that will 
connect me to the Internet with download speeds of &quot;up to&quot; 144kb/s 
within their respective &quot;nationwide&quot; coverage areas.  Certainly a lot 
faster than the 9600.  I have used both of these myself.   I use the 
Sprint service with a Novatel Merlin C201 PCMCIA card and the Verizon 
service with a Motorola T720c phone and a USB cable.  Both of these 
work with my Ti running 10.2.4.
