As a former Apple employee and one who wishes to continue to be a developer
in the industry, encouraging theft of software can be grounds for
termination.

Apple owns the software, they license it to us for use -- not for
distribution.  Anyone who breaks that trust is asking to not be trusted in
the future.  How would you feel if you shared something with someone with
the understanding that they wouldn't share it with anyone else -- and they
did anyway.  Would you trust that person again?

I didn't think so.

Whether it is a secret or software, the principle is the same.  There is no
&quot;difference in degree&quot; -- if you can't be trusted with small things, there
is no way that you'll be trusted with big things.
