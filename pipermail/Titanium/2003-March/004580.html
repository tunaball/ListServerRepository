<PRE>According to Bill Barton:

&gt;<i>Newbe question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>On my older mac's I would run disk first aid every week and try and 
</I>&gt;<i>run disk warrior every two weeks. Is there any recommendation for 
</I>&gt;<i>more or less usage with X? Plus run it before and after any new 
</I>&gt;<i>software installs. I was just getting ready to install PS Elements 2 
</I>&gt;<i>and Keynote
</I>&gt;<i>and got a few &quot;permission&quot; corrections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>bill
</I>
There are a couple of 'permissions corrections' that are practically 
standard operating procedure, not a cause for alarm.

Some folks, like myself, recommend a restart before installations of 
big apps, or OS updates. Also, as a rule, the only installations that 
run the risk of creating ownership/permissions problems are the 
installers that require you to type in an administrative password 
before the actual install. That 'requirement' is giving the installer 
de facto 'super user' privileges, and is where there is a risk of 
permissions errors. So, rather than run 'Repair Permissions after 
each install, just run them after installs which required admin 
passwords.

Your plan re: once a week  &quot;Disk Utility repair/verify, and periodic 
DiskWarrior usage, sounds healthy to me, just my opinion.

Also, depending on the nature of your work [i.e. lots of small file 
deletions, or image manipulation, audio treatment, etc] then a 
de-fragmenting routine might be in order also. I use Norton Speed 
Disk for that, even though I don't like Norton, because of issues 
that have been documented elsewhere, and, most regrettably, 
experienced myself. But Speed Disk is a very nice app, and i actually 
'trust' it more than the PlusOptimizer that is part of the full 
install of DiskWarrior. [although that may change with DW 3, we'll 
see].

I've heard that some folks reboot before and after running repair 
permissions, but, again, that would seem like overkill, unless one 
had installed several large apps, and any of them had required a 
password to do the install.

One thing: OSX really runs better with three things, from my 
experience: Correct permissions, at least 20% of free drive space on 
each drive or partition [as contiguous as possible, i.e. de-fragged 
periodically], and an un-fragmented, accurate Directory [which 
nothing does better than DiskWarrior, even older versions].

That's been my experience, more or less echoed by others, 
still...only my 2 cents.
