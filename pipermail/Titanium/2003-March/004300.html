I agree with this -- this would be the first placed I'd look.

OSX has a long timeout period when it can;t find an internet connection 
that it had previously.

For example, if i take the ethernet cable out of the socket in the back 
of my Ti, shut it down (without changing locations) and then start it 
up again on a train, it will take an extra couple of minutes to start 
up with a beachball because it is still looking for that connection.

Could be this kind of issue. Then again it could be something else, 
since this hasn't changed in 10.2.4

</I>&gt;<i> I have found _no_ other way to resolve the problem once it occurs, 
</I>&gt;<i> than to reboot the computer. And I do know quite a few &quot;'terminal' 
</I>&gt;<i> spells&quot; ;-).

Changing the location to one where all the network interfaces you 
aren't using are deactivated in network prefs might fix?
