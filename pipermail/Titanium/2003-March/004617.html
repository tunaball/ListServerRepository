I hear this allot: 2000 songs is too much.

But the thing is, it really isn't. Ya really need 4000 songs, and some room
for some software here and there, or a portable database or mail. Nobody
just &quot;turns on a iPod for 4 days to hear all the songs&quot;. That's not viable
usage.

If I go to my grannies, I need a playlist with 100 songs, and she may only
listen to 30 over a weekend, she may not like 70 of the others, but the next
weekend at my inlaws, my wifes granny might like 40 of the 70. The following
visit, I'll need yet new songs to entertain her, and I already have them
tucked in there. 

I may have say, 2000 songs, but depending on the crowd I am with, I may only
have 20 songs for each crowd in particular. When I go to a bikers house, I
better have a serious playlist for them too, and if they don't like it, I
got backups songs. I can't be saying, oh, let me go home and download some
more stuff from my 60 gig harddrive. I need a large selection, and I need it
now.

And you don't play a song twice for any particular get together. When you
duplicate songs, people will tend to think your &quot;fancy iPod toy&quot; is outdated
and un-fashionable now, so you have to pump in new stuff all the time. An
extreme metaphorical example of a small amount of songs would be listening
to the same CD over and over, and getting 200 people to listen to it for a
month.

I have playlists for everything and everyone: weddings, draftcard burnings,
opera, children's events, hoola-hoop contests and rollerderby, love-ins,
fight club, birthdays, traveling, war, etc, except I don't waste my space on
top 40, or anything ClearChannel Communication would play, of course. All
that crap is stored on their own FM stereo, anyhoo. With a 1/8&quot; jack, I am
ready for any scene at any place with a stereo input.

But I still need more simply for diversity of the crowds I may find myself
with.
