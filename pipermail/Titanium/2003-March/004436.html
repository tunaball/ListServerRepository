Well Colin, there's a flip side to the coin that is similar to 
painting. If certain programmers had their way, nothing would ever 
get released. Because it's never 'done'. In painting, that's one of 
the things that makes kids' work so vibrant, or fresh...they paint, 
go on to other things,and the painting is 'done'. As people get older 
[more 'sophisticated', theoretically] there is a tendency to keep 
adding layers of oil to canvas, or throwing tantrums and ripping it 
all up. The software companies need to make judgement calls, all the 
time.

As for iMovie, Apple could have charged a bomb for iMovie2, ignored 
'bugs' and conflicts that people experienced with their myriad 
setups, and then released iMovieX, let's say, and charged full price 
for the new program.

Kind of like Microsoft releasing a bug fix for Windows 95, and 
calling it Windows 98.

It's all about judgement, priorities, and the need to bite the 
bullet, and get something out there where it will be put through 'the 
mill'. Apple, for my money, is pretty damn diligent when it comes to 
upgrade policy.

Secrecy regarding imminent new releases has done far less irreparable 
harm than, say, Microsoft's old policy of 'vaporware', in which they 
assert that they're entering a niche software market, and thousands 
of folks abandon the current 'small' player in the niche, which, 
itself, goes bankrupt, as the people 'wait-for-the-Windows-version&quot; 
that never materializes. That demonstrates great money-saving on the 
part of MS. After all, companies, and their technologies, are much 
cheaper when bankrupt, but also displays a despicable attitude 
towards MS's own, 'loyal' customer base.

I'll go with Apple's de facto policy, any day.
