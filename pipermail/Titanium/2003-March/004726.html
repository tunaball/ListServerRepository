<PRE>I can not stress this enough but always, _always_ buy AppleCare for 
notebooks.  Unless you're already replacing your notebook every year 
and a half or so, AppleCare is worth its weight in gold after the first 
year.  In my second year, my TiBook 500 has had its DVD drive replace 3 
times, screen replaced twice (within 2 weeks of each other because of a 
recurring vertical line), motherboard replaced once, and the top shell 
(around the keyboard area) replaced once.  I practically have a new 
computer with all the times this thing's been in the shop.      I could 
still conceivably send it to the shop one more time for these hairline 
cracks I have on both my screen hinges but they don't seem critical at 
the moment.  If I hadn't extended my AppleCare I probably would've 
spent enough to buy 2 more Powerbooks.  My hard drive has been solid 
though.  Recently replaced it and it's still working fine as my 
external backup.
