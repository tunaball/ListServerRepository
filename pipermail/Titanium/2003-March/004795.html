The PCMCIA eject button is easy to accidentally press. I expect that it will occasionally eject a camera media card early on occasion.

I used it in the backseat of a car successfully today. I'm waiting to hear how it does on planes.

One time my Big Al apparently didn't close securely, and it was rather hot some time later. It spreads the heat out but it does get warm. Also, my fan comes on now and then. Overall, I'd rate it an improvement in running cool, and I don't feel the need to reduce the processor performance (System Preferences --&gt; Energy Saver --&gt; Options --&gt; Processor Performance).

I was very skeptical of this large a PowerBook before getting it. But one things really sold me on it. I have had trouble typing on all my recent PowerBooks including the TiBook. This one feels quite a bit different and improved, at least for my own typing. I make many fewer mistakes and the keyboard just plain feels more solid. Maybe it has partly to do with the solid aluminum, maybe it's something else.

Well, the typing improvement totally sold me on it and I wouldn't go back.
