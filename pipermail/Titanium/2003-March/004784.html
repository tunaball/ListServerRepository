<PRE>I too can attest to the longevity of Macs. 

I have a IIvx which I bought in November of '92.  Since March of '93, the 
IIvx has been on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!  I use it to receive all 
faxes!  Still has the original hard drive, plus a 2nd one I installed in '93. 
 It has never failed and works flawlessly to this day!  I take the case off 
every couple of years, and vacuum the dust out of it.

My Duo 2300, with DuoDock II never failed.  I still have it, but don't use it 
anymore.  the system is for sale if anyone is interested.

My Wallstreet G3/300/DVD which I bought in February of 1999, (except for the 
infamous sound board which I replaced), works perfectly and is my workhorse. 
It is used at both jobs, and my home office, on about 20 hours a day.  I love 
the fact that it has the expansion bays.  I have 2 HDs, Zip, SuperDrive, and 
DVD-ROM.  It will be replaced as my workhorse when I finally get my new PB 
17&quot;, which has been on order since the begining of Feb. :(

Also have a 7300/200, again purchased new, which is used by my wife.

I still have an SE has never failed, but now has been collecting dust in a 
closet for a number of years.
