Shawn,

I haven't downloaded any of the &quot;unofficial betas,&quot; and will wait until
there is a more stable, official  version out, however Loren does make a
point.  Have you seen Dave Hyatt's weblog
(<A HREF="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/">http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/</A>), which said the following on
February 27th?

&gt;<i> ... if there were a Safari v62, and it did happen to leak to the public, and
</I>&gt;<i> someone did happen to run it, and that person did happen to discover a bug
</I>&gt;<i> with text-decoration, well then I would hypothetically be most grateful, and
</I>&gt;<i> would in fact fix such a bug with the utmost expedience. In fact, it might
</I>&gt;<i> even be fixed already, assuming of course there were such a build, and it did
</I>&gt;<i> in fact have this problem.
</I>
Sounds like he wasn't too broken up about the &quot;unauthorized beta&quot; being
released, and in effect was asking for help in fixing a bug.  And this is
the lead developer - and an Apple employee.  So, I would agree with Loren
that Apple isn't to concerned about this being out there.

THOUGHT FOR THE DAY:
&quot;Power outage at a department store yesterday, Twenty people were trapped on
the escalators.&quot;
