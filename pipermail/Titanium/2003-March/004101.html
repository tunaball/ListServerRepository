Whenever I remove my D-Link, I don't bother turning Bluetooth off.  But 
when I plug the adapter back in, OSX automatically detects that it's 
been plugged in and the menu gets turned back on.  Not exactly sure why 
it seems like your computer isn't recognizing that the adapter is 
there.  What version of the OS are you running?

&gt;<i> Then, tired of so much fun, I turn in for the evening. It seems that I 
</I>&gt;<i> have to turn off BT at the top right of the screen, before closing the 
</I>&gt;<i> lid on the PB (the time that I didn?t, I got a warning that I hadn?t

</I>&gt;<i> bother writing it down).
</I>
That's weird, my TiBook goes to sleep without a problem even if my 
adapter is plugged in.  Doesn't complain.  Even if I have the Clicker 
published on my phone.  When I wake it from sleep, the Clicker actually 
acts like my phone just came into proximity and starts playing iTunes.

&gt;<i> So it seems to me clicker is a great app if you have a mac desktop,

</I>&gt;<i> so be &quot;on&quot; all the time), and looking at apple's bt forums, that does 
</I>&gt;<i> not seem to be on the horizon. And if clicker didn?t exist, I wouldn?t 
</I>&gt;<i> recommend a T68.
</I>
Well with the USB adapters ideally the OS is supposed to recognize that 
the adapter is inserted.  Not sure why it's not recognizing yours but 
that's not normal behavior.
