<PRE>my dear Ti friends,

my first ever contact with accounting and accounting software was in 
1998 when I was working as a summer intern in a small company who did 
their accounting using the Quicken package.

I liked the &quot;accounting for beginners&quot; style it took and ended up using 
it for some accounting of my own since then.

Yesterday I needed to get my accountant to look at the data and was 
unsurprised that he doesn't use Quicken (it has never been a big 
product in the UK where a system called SAGE dominates). &quot;i'll just do 
an export to CSV&quot;, I thought to myself...

Shock Horror! No Export to anything but QIF (Quicken Interchange 
Format) -- a text file with a rather proprietary data format.

Next step was to look on the intuit website, who i figured would sell 
me a convertor. No such luck. They avoid the issue of exporting from 
quicken to anything but quicken.

Next step was to google for shareware scripts. I found a freeware 
script that did work, but did the job badly (everything in a big long 
list), and also a shareware script from bigredconsulting.com in the 
form of an Addin that i was prepared to pay 50 dollars for, but in the 
end downloaded the trial and found it doesn't work with the output from 
my quicken 2002 deluxe export to QIF. Good job I hadn't paid for it 
before I tested it!

I spent 2 years writing excel macros, so I could probably write a 
script in a couple of hours to do it, but given the urgency (and room 
for error)  of the situation I'd rather not.

&lt;em&gt;Can anyone help me?&lt;/em&gt;

of course my romance with Intuit has come to an end (getting the US 
software shipped to me even though they stopped releasing UK versions). 
Time to leave Quicken behind and find new pastures to place my debits 
and credits upon...
