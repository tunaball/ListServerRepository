<PRE>According to David Remahl:

&gt;<i>Heh...That's funny. Those two applications are the only ones that 
</I>&gt;<i>crash regularly on my machine :-). Well, there are a few others that 
</I>&gt;<i>do it too, but very seldom. Word crashes as soon as I touch it 
</I>&gt;<i>(which is why I don't :) and Photoshop crashes every once in a while.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In conclusion, running Mac OS X with less than 1 GB of hard disk 
</I>&gt;<i>space is a BadThing. Having less than 400MB free (which Photoshop 
</I>&gt;<i>could certainly cause with its internal disk swap) - is a 
</I>&gt;<i>ReallyBadThing, and is known to cause the system to forget 
</I>&gt;<i>preferences. With even less space available, you risk the whole 
</I>&gt;<i>system, in case it runs out of VM (an ExtremelyBadThing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>/ Rgds, David Remahl
</I>
Now that you mention it, I have heard of the 80 MB 'chunk' of Swap 
space, as a block, that gets incremented. I've ben trying to figure 
out what invisible thing is taking up 1.25 GB of space on my internal 
drive.

The thing with Word, though, is different for different setups, I 
suppose. I hear people gripe about Word a lot. But I've used Office 
on my Ti, and on a reasonably decked-out Voodoo PC, and the Office 
app is far more stable and maybe even slicker,on the Mac.

I'm not writing novels in Word, but it gets used heavily, and all i 
could report was my own experience. The most recent Word crash was 
last October. [it's still in my Crash reporter logs].  I also only 
use Entourage for PIM stuff, albeit, heavily, so it isn't required to 
grab 4 or 500 pieces of mail off all sorts of servers on a daily 
basis, I leave that to Eudora, which crashed in January once, but I 
don't remember how or why.[it's in the Logs, also].

Basically, what I was saying is that Photoshop and OSX like lots of 
clean, non-fragmented breathing room, and as much RAM as possible. 
And the whole system, apps, utilities,  and OS, included, benefits 
greatly from an accurate, non-fragmented Directory, whether you run 
graphic converter, or P-Shop, makes no difference. A Directory in 
disarray, as well as a drive in a fragmented state, only bring 
everything down, inexorably, over time. Period
