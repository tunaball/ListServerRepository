<PRE>Hi Mike,

sorry but I do not see the point. I said: you have to change card. The 
fact that in the PowerBook the card comes pre-installed does not change 
the equation: I do not need to change the motherboard: I have to change 
the card. The problem I think relies on the antenna: the one in the 
Airport card is not enough for Airport Extreme, hence no simple swap 
Airport card. Use an external one.

I do not think - but I accept to be corrected in that - you may tell 
centrino - maybe - not to use its built-in the chip wireless. Does 
Intel states explicitly that I could have that chip functioning the 
same and providing the same services which are provided by this 
technology with an external card after I told the system to disallow 
its built-in device?

If the Intel-ligent thing is not to have to use a wireless card at all 
(Airport, Lucent, etc,) then I do not see the point in all the buzz and 
fuss around centrino.

I might be wrong but I do not see it as *just* a wireless card 
integration. Intel plans to build services around that wireless-chip. I 
do not think a regular Dell laptop would access those same services 
with a regular wireless card.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, there will be a difference. Apple updated its wireless line with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Airport Extreme (802.11g). Do you need to change the laptop? nope,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change the card and use the new standard. You are now instead a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> centrino user. In a couple of years a new standard comes out for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wireless which allows you to get more (speed, bandwidth, whatever): do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you change card? Nope, you have to change laptop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Uh, you might want to recheck that.  If I want an Apple-provided 
</I>&gt;<i> 802.11g
</I>&gt;<i> solution I *will* have to change laptops, as they've clearly stated 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> there will be no Airport Extreme upgrades for older TiBooks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if I want 802.11g I can go with a 3rd party PC Card - which is 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly
</I>&gt;<i> what you'd end up doing with one of these Centrino machines.  No 
</I>&gt;<i> difference
</I>&gt;<i> whatsoever.
