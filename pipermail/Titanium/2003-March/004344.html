If I'm not mistaken, this chip operates with 802.11 (b? g? a? I don't  
know...).  It doesn't sound that innovative or fascinating to me.  I  
don't quite understand what makes it so unique, other than it will be  
in all notebooks.

As for thins &quot;unleashing&quot; your notebook...I just want a way to  
disconnect the 6 cables coming out of my tibook.
Telephone cable: If the airport in my tibook would work, this would be  
gone.
Mouse: C'mon bluetooth...
Printer: Airport Extreme Base Station, I'm looking forward to you
Firewire: I guess I need better optical drives (17&quot; Powerbook, hurry up  
and ship) and bigger internal drives.
Sound out: I'd really love to find a way to be wirelessly connected to  
my speakers...the tibook ones don't cut it.  Maybe I'll have to give in  
to an iPod.
Power: much longer battery life will come eventually.....

Intel seems to be hitting the wireless networking industry that's doing  
great on it's own.  Sure, now intel wants manufacturers to put their  
chip in their laptops to that ALL laptops now have them, but this is  
nothing new.  Many companies include 802.11 in their laptops, and  
almost all allow it as an option.

It doesn't take apple to innovate, but they always seem to be the ones  
that do.  As for this technology causing apple to lose some sales, I  
don't really see that happening.

But who knows...
