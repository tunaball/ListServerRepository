The depressing thing about Visio is that no thought has gone into 
usability. Even venerable Mac drawing packages from the 1980's such 
as MacDraw were way better as far as usability is concerned. Here's a 
trivial example:

Create a new object, e.g. a square. Duplicate it. Move the duplicate 
to where you want it. Now do another duplicate. MacDraw will put the 
third object at the same relative displacement to
the second object as between the first and the second, i.e. you get 
three (or as many as you like) linearly distributed objects. This is 
great when you want a row of identical objects, all evenly spaced. 
Try this in Visio.

This is just one of many examples of the fundamental difference 
between a drawing package where usability has been thought about, and 
one which has just been thrown together by a bunch of programmers who 
probably never actually use the package.

I don't do much drawing these days, but when I do I use OmniGraffle 
on the Mac. Cheap and effective, but I gather not everybody is a fan 
of it.

Paul
