<PRE>Is anyone besides me beginning to question the reliability of the TiBook at
least the 15&quot; family?

Either I got the one lemon from the Apple tree or the 15&quot; TiBook has got to
be the most fragile notebook out there. August of last year I purchased my
15&quot; PowerBook G4 DVI and today it's in the shop AGAIN. I am writing this on
my G3 Lombard which I think I could drop kick and it would keep on ticking.

My TiBook has been babied more than any notebook I've ever owned (540C, Duo
280, Duo 2300,&amp; Lombard to name a few) Within a year of purchase the Ti's
paint began to bubble then the left screen hinge just snapped. I immediately
contacted Apple and to Apple's credit they repaired it within a week.

Recently I shared my latest woes with the list. Thanks for the replies. Most
of you said &quot;sounds like the logic board&quot; so I took it to the Tampa Apple
store. The verdict; &quot;seems like it's the logic board.&quot;

Yesterday began the second week of the third repair. The Apple care site
reports the ominous words &quot;hold - awaiting parts&quot;. A call today said two to
three days before repair restarts. Looks like three weeks plus. At least at
this point Apple will soon have replaced my TiBook one part at a time :)

Perhaps Apple has addressed the problems with the 12&quot; &amp; 17&quot; and the promised
new 15&quot;. 

Here's hoping the rest of you have better luck with your TiBooks.

J Fisher
