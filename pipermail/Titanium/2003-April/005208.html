<PRE>&gt;<i> Just wanted to vent a little...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yesterday I purchase a new iMac from the Apple Store at Kenwood Towne
</I>&gt;<i> Center in Cincinnati, got it home and found that there was a a pixel
</I>&gt;<i> stuck on BRIGHT red near the center of my screen.  I researched Apple's
</I>&gt;<i> website and found that it was within spec and Apple gave instructions
</I>There was a program I remember from year ago that solved this conundrum. It
would make enough pixels go &quot;bad&quot; (actually it just made them appear bad) to
meet  Apples requirements for an exchange.  They you got a trade.

The downside of all this is that replacement LCD's are, apparently, far more
likely to have pixel defects than those installed in production. So you
might be better off with the  one bad pixel you have rather than take a
chance on a screen that has a few more.  (massage often will work even if it
takes a long time.)

Call the Apple district  manager and plead your case. The guys at the Apple
Store really are not in a position to do what you ask.  So please do not
lean on them too much, as they are doing what they are told to do. However
if you have a relationship with any of the guys at the Apple store it would
seem to me that they would try to talk their supervisors into taking care of
it since you are a good customer.

Be reasonable but persistent and I think someone will fix you up. I have
seen a few get all new PowerBooks from Apple at times, so it is not unheard
of.  Bottom line is Apple knows their greatest asset is their customer base
and that should work in your favor.
Good Luck!

&gt;<i> on how to massage the screen in hopes that it would unstick.  I tried
</I>&gt;<i> all of that, but to no avail.  Having just purchased it yesterday, I
</I>&gt;<i> thought I would be able to go in and explain my dissatisfaction and
</I>&gt;<i> exchange it--especially since I'm a very regular customer, having
</I>&gt;<i> purchased a PowerBook, iBook, iPod, Palm Tungsten | T, Microsoft
</I>&gt;<i> Office, digital camera, and various other software and peripherals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well...much to my dismay and disgust, they basically said &quot;tough shit.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Technically I understand that they were correct, but having purchased
</I>&gt;<i> so many things there and having waited for them to get stock in when
</I>&gt;<i> Microcenter had what I needed in stock, just so that I could purchase
</I>&gt;<i> it from Apple and give them the business, I feel like my patronage is
</I>&gt;<i> completely unappreciated.  Even after telling them that they didn't
</I>&gt;<i> care.  I told them that if I walk out of there unsatisfied, they would
</I>&gt;<i> be losing a lot of future business as I would never buy from them
</I>&gt;<i> again.  They said it was my call.  So I walked out of there with a
</I>&gt;<i> refund (less a 10% restocking fee), a bad taste in my mouth, and then
</I>&gt;<i> went to Microcenter to buy my iMac (which is free of dead or stuck
</I>&gt;<i> pixels).  The Apple Store will NOT get any of my business ever again.
</I>&gt;<i> If I ran my business with their disregard for customer loyalty and
</I>&gt;<i> patronage, I wouldn't HAVE a business.  I'm not going to switch to PCs
</I>&gt;<i> over this, but I do not support any business that doesn't treat me as
</I>&gt;<i> I've treated them.
