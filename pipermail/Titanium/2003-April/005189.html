<PRE>&gt;<i> But there is no choice but to wait.
</I>
The other choice is to buy a 1ghz 15&quot; tibook now, considering the 
following;

1) It's possible, but I think unlikely that Apple's 15&quot; Albook, when it 
is released, will be faster than 1ghz - I think this because I don't 
think it's likely that Apple would release a 15&quot; pbook that is faster 
than the 17&quot;, and think that releasing a new 17&quot; so soon after shipping 
the 1st one would upset existing customers who've only just started 
receiving their machines.

2) The current 15&quot; apparently has a better performance graphics chipset 
(ati 9000) than the 12&quot; and 17&quot; (GeForce4) (says xlr8yourmac). The 
speed of the 15&quot; 1ghz also beats some of the 17&quot; tests done at 
<A HREF="http://www.barefeats.com/pb17.html">http://www.barefeats.com/pb17.html</A>

3) The current 15&quot; is based on a design which has gone through several 
architecture revisions, so many unforeseen 'quirks' would have been 
addressed by now, unlike a newly designed 15&quot;.

4) The new 15&quot; will most likely have internal bluetooth, airport 
extreme, FW800 and a glowing keyboard. These are nice, but for most 
people, probably not urgent.

So, now that I've said all that, my prediction for the new Albook 15&quot; 
is mid-May, but I'm only basing that on the previous pattern of 
approximately six month updates. At the end of the day, when I asked a 
similar question to this list when the 667 was the best tibook around, 
I think the best answer was 'If you need it *now*, buy it. If you can 
wait, then do so, because there's always something better coming out in 
the not too distant future.'
