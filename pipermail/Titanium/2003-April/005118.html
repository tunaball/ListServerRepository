I'm sure it is.  I don't know how &quot;Shared Sockets&quot; works on the 
technical end, but I do know how NAT works (maybe it's the same thing 
with different terminology - I don't know).  Maybe you could make a new 
fixed size drive image, then try a new fresh install of Windows and see 
what happens just as an experiment. I'm shooting in the dark, because 
it's hard to diagnose something like that without being &quot;hands on&quot;.  My 
thought is that maybe VPC 5.0 installed some special Windows network 
drivers that VPC 6.0 doesn't use but Windows is still using them?  I 
would think that's possible, seeing as how the VPC Additions are 
installed pretty much automatically in Windows, so I see no reason that 
VPC 5.0 couldn't do something like that with network drivers. Again, 
I'm just guessing, as I upgraded from VPC 3.0 to 6.0, so I never got a 
chance to use 5.0.  Did 5.0 even emulate the same NIC card as 6.0?  I 
know when I converted my old win98 image from VPC 3.0, windows found 
all sorts of new hardware when it fired up the first time.

Also - just another thought - I see you mention the saved drive images. 
  You can't make any changes to the VPC network preferences while the 
drive images are in a saved state. Your guest operating system must be 
shut down first.

It's just a thought - I'm sure after dumping $99 on the VPC upgrade 
you'd like to see it working!
