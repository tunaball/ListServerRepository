<PRE>Did anyone ever reply to Robert's query? (reproduced below in it's entirety lest anyone forget any of it)  Let me take a stab at it.
     I don't know what you are expecting from Apple regarding your AppleCare, but all I got the first time was a letter saying I had AppleCare.  And it arrived via the United States Postal Service  which does not have tracking like UPS.   When I finally called after a few weeks inquiring why I had not received my disc repair utility as promised, they apologized profusely and mailed me one right out.  Again, it came United States mail...no way to track it.  (And that was months ago, and I have yet to need to use that disc.)
      If something goes wrong  and you need to make a claim against AppleCare, all you have to do is call Apple  and tell them you bought it.  Armed with your name and adress, they can track your AppleCare service and verify that you are indeed covered.  
       When I called Apple, I took the position that they forgot my disc and would send it...and indeed they did send it right out without a problem.  
       If you really think you were mistreated by any particular employee, I suggest you call back and file a complaint.  My experience with Apple is that they do care how their employees treat the customers.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No they are not and they are extremely arrogant people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been told that even though Apple has sent the product to the wrong 
</I>&gt;<i> address that I have to wait b/w 4-6 weeks before they know whether it 
</I>&gt;<i> will arrive here or not before they ship another one. Now I'm not 
</I>&gt;<i> expecting another one but I do expect that Apple know when a product 
</I>&gt;<i> has shipped and perferably be able to track it. Neither of which is 
</I>&gt;<i> currently possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, somebody pays $300+ dollars for something that Apple cannot get to 
</I>&gt;<i> the customer for 4-6 weeks from the order date and has no 
</I>&gt;<i> way to track 
</I>&gt;<i> it after it's shipped.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Somebody needs to sort this out.
