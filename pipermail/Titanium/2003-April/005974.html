<PRE>I want to thank everyone who replied to my request (both online and 
off).  I have a workable resolution to my issue, although I am certain 
that my solution is NOT necessarily the correct one.  What I did was to 
place my new stencils downloaded from the &quot;Extras&quot; page in the 
following directory:

/Applications/OmniGraffle 
Professional.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Stencils/

Along with the other stencils.  After moving them to this location and 
re-launching the application, they were all there in the &quot;Stencils&quot; 
drop-down menu.  This is a new application for me and there is still 
some confusion as some of you apparently get to your stencils by 
clicking on &quot;Tools&quot; then Pallets.  The OmniGraffle Pro 3.0 that I 
downloaded yesterday does not have these options.

In case anyone is interested, the stencils that I downloaded, and now 
work well, are:

HP9000 systems
SGI systems
Sun equipment
Network 3D

I hope that ultimately OmniGroup support team will reply to my email 
with an official letter.  I won't drag this thread out any longer or 
add to the confusion, but those of you who are having the same problem 
that I am, please reply to me off line and I will forward along what 
ever OmniGroup ultimately email's me.  Or you can report the problem 
yourselves also.

Thanks,

Jerry K
