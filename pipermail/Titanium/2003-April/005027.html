&gt;<i>Dear owners of AlBooks,

I am (an original, RevA) Ti-500 owner, but took the liv=berty of replying ...

&gt;<i>Being an owner of the rather delicate TiBook, I was wondering whether any of
</I>&gt;<i>you had yet had reason to be grateful for the toughness of their aluminium
</I>&gt;<i>casing? In other words - are they as durable as might be hoped for?
</I>
I do not feel that my Ti-500 is &quot;delicate&quot;.  It is not solid and 
durable like the Pismo, but it gets a lot of movment and handling by 
me over the last 2+ years, and I have seen no effects.  Where it has 
been in and out of my briefcase thousands of times, there is some 
wearing of the grey surface, but it is minor cosmetic.

&gt;<i>And a second more generally directed question - will Apple continue to
</I>&gt;<i>manufacture the 15&quot; TiBook for much longer or is it likely to be recased to
</I>&gt;<i>be more consistent with its larger and smaller siblings?
</I>
I have no knowledge, but I am expecting that the 15&quot; will re-vamped 
soon, once the 12&quot; and 17&quot; are really out there in some numbers.
Nobody makes any computer as slow as 500 MHz anymore.....
I myself would definitely prefer to have all the connections at the 
back, to make for a neater desk, but am realistically expecting that 
the new hinge design will dominate over that consideration.
To me, the 15&quot; seems an optimum between portability and performance.
I can see no reason why I - for what I do - would ever buy a desktop 
machine ever again, after 6 years with only a laptop.  I expect that 
later 2003 or early 2004 I will move to a new 15&quot; laptop.
With my 40Gb 5400 drive and soon to be 1 Gb RAM, running 10.2.4, I 
will be fine for about another year, if I can keep my desire for &quot;the 
latest&quot; under control.

regards,  Trevor
