<PRE>Okay...that was weird.

Some guy from Apple called me at home.  He knew I'd been thinking of 
buying a 12&quot; PowerBook (either he lurks on the list or he knows Miss 
Cleo).  I told him I already bought one at Micro Center, and told him 
why I didn't buy it at the Apple Store.

&quot;Picture it...Cincinnati, Ohio in 2003.  I walk into the Mac store 
where I've blown thousands and thousands of dollars with a defective 
product that they tell me isn't defective.&quot;  You guys remember the 
story.  BTW Judge Judy's book title would fit well here:  Don't Pee on 
My Leg and Tell Me It's Raining.

So I told him how I had a bad taste in my mouth from the Apple Retail 
Store and wouldn't buy there again.  He kind of agreed with them, but 
said in the end it depends on who you deal with.  He also kind of 
acknowledged that Apple has a corporate attitude about things, whereas 
Micro Center (the new beneficiary of my Mac addiction) has the 
flexibility to accept returns such as a bad pixel in order to keep 
their customers happy.  So Apple doesn't care about a customer's 
happiness?

I still don't have a better attitude toward the Apple Store, but at 
least Oscar gave me his name and number so I can call for help later.
