<PRE>Sherman, there is supposedly an Apple Store opening in Ginza here in Tokyo.
I guarantee that the customer experience there will be wonderful. Come visit
and we will go to the opening. And in a Japanese McDonalds the staff move
like a ballet troupe and they execute your order with efficiency, precision
and total politeness.  When I go back to the USA or Germany I am always
stunned by the general level of rudeness and incivility.

SO this is less an Apple Store problem than it is a cultural problem.  Last
year I fired an upper-level American staff member for tossing a pile of file
folders on a lower level staff members desk and saying &quot;I have a Masters
Degree, I don't think I should have to file these.&quot; It was really amazing
how pleasant the working environment became after that. Maybe Apple can make
an example of a few in this way and send the message that I sent, rudeness
will not be tolerated at ANY Level.  But that will never happen if Apple is
not told of these incidents. (And frankly,  management has no place to talk
if they treat the staff badly.  Leadership is only effective if it models
the desired behavior.  So Apple might need to cull some management, as
well.)
 
&gt;<i> I used to like going to the Apple Store, but I really think that the
</I>&gt;<i> place is going down hill.  I have had several negative experiences
</I>&gt;<i> there lately.  It is just not fun anymore. I think that the Manager
</I>&gt;<i> there is an idiot and should be fired.  I have not been too any other
</I>&gt;<i> Apple Stores, but I think that this one is becoming an embarrassment
</I>&gt;<i> to Apple.
</I>
</PRE>
