Christopher,

I totally agree! I don't find many CD liners worth mentioning which is why I
said 98% of them (we're talking CD liners, not album art) are useless, not
all. Often they're filled with label/management garbage - how to buy some
shirt or hat with the labels logo on it or how to get to the website and buy
the same. More often today, the bands have absolutely NOTHING to do with
those CD liners.

Now you're talking about something completely different with album artwork.
Back in the day musicians and labels used to employ real artists, designers
or even themselves to build these amazing images. Making a huge visual
impact on culture and often emphasizing statements or scenery built by the
music contained within. All of the titles you mention are from the vinyl
era, many of those albums in CD reproduction have their artwork reduced and
diminshed even further.

I have a 15 year collection of vinyl that reaches pretty far back. The drop
off of that creative component of music and visual culture has been fading
at an increasing pace for years. Maybe that's disappointing to you now, I
have been disappointed since CD's were released.

Glad to hear I am not the only one noticing this.
