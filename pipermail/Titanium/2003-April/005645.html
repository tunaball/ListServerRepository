I work in an environment that is probably 99% Windows. I receive many 
documents created under Windows.  Word documents are mostly OK except 
for drawings embedded in them.  It may be just the drawings that 
start out as Visio things, I don't know, but often the rectangles are 
missing and things like that.

PowerPoint files are probably the most incompatible.  I think that 
Microsoft uses a lot of their own non standard characters in 
powerpoint.  So I see differences here.  On one common template that 
I see a lot, our company logo comes out upside down.  I can flip it 
on the master slide, bet we are still not 100%.

I can't recall seeing any problems with Excel.  Microsoft seems to 
have the format under control enough to be compatible.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;----------------------

That's funny; I have never seen such antics when using PowerPoint on my Macs...not to say it really isn't happening: I just haven't seen it.  In which version of Office do you tend to see this?  I've received many a PowerPoint file created on a PC, and have opened it in Mac Office '97 and Mac Office X, and the files always have looked right.  Now, if as you mentioned, you are getting files with embedded Visio objects (or other third-party created objects) you may not be able to see them, or they may not get rendered properly without the third-party application.  IIRC, Visio is now owned by Microsoft, FWIW.
