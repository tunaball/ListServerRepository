<PRE>&gt;<i>I've owned and used Macs since I purchased a new 512ke. Never been 
</I>&gt;<i>one to always
</I>&gt;<i>update systems (I generally stay with whatever came installed on the 
</I>&gt;<i>box) so I wonder,
</I>&gt;<i>have there been so many buggy issues with previous system 
</I>&gt;<i>releases... systems prior to
</I>&gt;<i>X? Every time I feel about ready to make the upgrade leap from 9, 
</I>&gt;<i>the list seems to
</I>&gt;<i>fill up with discussions of problems, bugs and glitches users of X 
</I>&gt;<i>are having... and I
</I>&gt;<i>really don't relish the thought of dealing with all the apparent 
</I>&gt;<i>issues, especially as
</I>&gt;<i>my 'book works flawlessly with the original 9.1 installed. So is X 
</I>&gt;<i>unusual in this
</I>&gt;<i>respect or have I just not been aware of similar problems when 
</I>&gt;<i>earlier system releases
</I>&gt;<i>were made?
</I>
So you don't remember the horrid performance of various flavors of 
System 7?  When developers were REALLY bailing out of the platform in 
droves?  System 8 &amp; 9 both had their quirks but we were (are) so 
familiar with them we just have convenient workarounds; we know when 
we see certain behavior in OS8/9 that it is time to rebuild the 
desktop, or ditch certain preferences, etc...

We are still learning what those things are in OSX. For me the 
learning is part of the fun (sort of like how some people enjoy golf 
even though they are swearing and cursing and breaking clubs at times 
haha). Once through the initial learning curve, most of us have never 
looked back... the advantages of OSX far outweigh the issues being 
discussed here. Try this in OS9: Launch 5 applications at once (you 
will probably have to make aliases), then open the finder and start 
opening folders until you find a file to open; then open that file. 
You can't. If launching the 5 apps doesn't completely lock up the 
system, you will at least have to wait until they are all launched to 
get reasonable use of your system back.

In OSX I regularly run along the dock and click all the apps I am 
going to need for the day. I can flip back and forth through the 
start up screens if I wish, go to the finder, search for files, as 
soon as the browser pops up I am surfing the net. while this other 
stuff goes on in the background.  That is what protected memory and 
TRUE pre-emptive multitasking will do for you.

I would say that Loren has the best idea about making the switch to 
OSX in that it would be best done with a complete zero-data 
reinitialize of the hard drive.  Many of the issues being discussed 
are not being commonly experienced, which indicates that the issues 
are specific to a given configuration. Let OSX be the OS that 
initializes your drive and I think things will be better in the long 
run.
