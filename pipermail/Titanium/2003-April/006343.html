Coming from a lawyer I would imagine he is well aware of how copyright works
(can't assume though!?)

I know that in many cases an original artists/writers/authors work is
allowed to be 'reproduced' as long as all relevant links and credit is given
where due. Given that this is probably the property of the WSJ and not the
original author's, it could cause some problems. I am sure there is a legal
mention of this on WSJ's website. The typical disclaimer would apply.

Frankly I don't give a damn though and appreciate not having to submit my
email address to a spam machine disguised as login access to 'exclusive
material' (that point is the only reason why I reply here to the Ti list and
not personally). Don't participate in reading the 'plagiarized' quote if you
don't want to, but unless you're calling the WSJ to rat him out, why fight
about it here?  If you have a problem with someone - be a man and take it up
with him. If you have already have, good for you. Shouting matches in the
playground serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever and make everyone involved
look, well, foolish.

Sorry Shawn, I know that you know a lot more than most and I legitimately
appreciate your insight and experience - but sometimes to me, you come
across as a know it all. And you have already humbly and elegantly proved
that you do not. Maybe I am too laid back, but I find people who let others'
actions get to them lead short lives. Why stress it?

Just my .02cents worth (don't ask me what that's worth after the exchange)
