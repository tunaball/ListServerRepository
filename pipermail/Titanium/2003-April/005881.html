It's one of the most fragile, and should be treated with kid gloves and 
given its own sleeve and chamois leather keyboard overlay to protect 
the screen.

Other than that it is simply the finest computer I have ever owned. 
Definitely not a lemon at all imho.

</I>
Yes I agree it doesn't have the &quot;toughness&quot; of a G3 Powebook or a 
toilet seat iBook.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> (540C, Duo
</I>&gt;<i> 280, Duo 2300,&amp; Lombard to name a few) Within a year of purchase the

</I>
I've had the Firewire port die -- which was fixed under warranty.

Other than that the  problems are &quot;cosmetic&quot; -- pain etc..

However I do take great care of my Ti. It lives in a specially made 
sleeve that fits in specially made bag (www.timbuktu.com).

I carry it with me wherever I go -- and even when my bag gets kicked in 
a nightclub my Ti is fine.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yesterday began the second week of the third repair.
</I>
This is very bad luck!

&gt;<i> The Apple care site
</I>&gt;<i> reports the ominous words &quot;hold - awaiting parts&quot;.
</I>
Oh yeah I've heard that one.

&gt;<i> A call today said two to
</I>&gt;<i> three days before repair restarts. Looks like three weeks plus. At 
</I>&gt;<i> least at
</I>&gt;<i> this point Apple will soon have replaced my TiBook one part at a time 
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>
My one and only repair took 5 weeks. I was incredibly annoyed. I told 
Apple.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps Apple has addressed the problems with the 12&quot; &amp; 17&quot; and the 
</I>&gt;<i> promised
</I>&gt;<i> new 15&quot;.
</I>
The new aluminium casing is much sturdier from what I can see. The thin 
back on the screen will continue to make this delicate, but light and 
classy in appearance.

Sounds like your experiences are much worse than average though that I 
have seen on this list over the last 2 years.

Hope things improve for you :)
