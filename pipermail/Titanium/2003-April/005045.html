<PRE>My main reason for this e-mail is that after playing with a 17&quot; 
Powerbook at voelker research, I think it will suit me nicely.  
Honestly I think it seemed a little bigger than I was expecting 
(contradictory to what I've heard most people say), but it's an amazing 
machine and I can't wait to be using one full time (especially with all 
the issues I've been having with my tibook 400...i guess I should have 
bought applecare).

So, one thing that I've been excited about since apple announced it is 
Bluetooth.  And finally, with the 17&quot;, I have no choice but to have it. 
  However, my flare for it has gotten smaller and smaller, because as 
time goes on, I don't see more and more bluetooth products being 
offered.  When apple announced using it and selling the usb dongles I 
expected an explosion of products from mac vendors, but thus far, it 
seems like the only thing people are using it for is to sync with 
phones and PDAs.

So, my question is: is anyone on this list using bluetooth devices 
OTHER than phones and PDAs?  What do you use it for?  Anyone have a 
really neat bluetooth mouse or anything else that they love?

I guess I'll do some bluetooth research on both apple's site and 
bluetooth.com.  But, I hope bluetooth isn't just over-hyped technology.
