<PRE>Eureka! For some reason, 24 hrs later, my umpteenth attempt to install Os 9
worked. This time I was presented with a secondary installer screen
together with options to install All or Os 9 only, etc. It's the first time
I have seen this secondary installer window and Apple's ReadMe doesn't
mention that there is a a quick initiall installation (of something but
obviously not Os 9) followed by another, main, installation.

Now, I'm hoping that I can just delete Os X and put Os 9 on any partition
of my choosing. I did ask Apple UK tech support why the restore/install DVD
insists upon first installing X and then only permits installation of 9 to
a partition which already contains an X system and I was told that it was
because Apple wants all users to have an Os X experience!! Thanks for
wasting my time, Apple.
