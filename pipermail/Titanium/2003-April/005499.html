<PRE>According to Michael Bigley:

&gt;&gt;<i>Strange.  I have all kinds of third-party stuff: QuicKeys, LaunchBar,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Default Folder, CopyPaste, TinkerTool.  Couldn't live without 'em.  Two days
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and no problems with 10.2.5.  It just worked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think Loren's idea of zero all data has merit. I have seen lots of 
</I>&gt;<i>posts after OS upgrades that report computer-specific problems; if 
</I>&gt;<i>there are not specific apps or configs that are causing the issues, 
</I>&gt;<i>it seems that there must be some issues deep within the individual 
</I>&gt;<i>hardware/software that cause anomalies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>After reading some of the reports on this list, I backed up my 
</I>&gt;<i>User/Library/Preferences folder, but fortunately had none of the 
</I>&gt;<i>reported problems. I am sure that is frustrating for folks like 
</I>&gt;<i>Flipper who, from all accounts manages his OS pretty meticulously.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Also, one of the things I did in the early days of OSX, because I 
</I>&gt;<i>had no understanding of UNIX permissions, is that I reset the 
</I>&gt;<i>permissions of a number of folders so I could see and use them... 
</I>&gt;<i>this caused no end of flakiness in my computer until I did a fresh, 
</I>&gt;<i>clean install (but did not zero out HD). I suppose Jag's &quot;repair 
</I>&gt;<i>permissions&quot; tool fixes that sort of foolishness.
</I>&gt;<i>--
</I>
No comment on repair permissions, although wiser folks than myself 
have suggested launching from Installer, doing a disk repair, the 
permissions, THEN the Apple upgrade, then another repair routine. How 
Mr &amp; Mrs America are supposed to tra-la-la through their digital 
'hubs' behind that foolishness is better left to the wiser amongst us.

My question: How to go about a low level reformat on my terms?

I used silverling pro for years, but no more, i guess. on my ti 667, 
i would like to reset the allocation minimums to 1k rather than the 
4, or 8k, that seems to be the Apple HFS+ default. How can i do this? 
What software?

I haven't felt the need to backup everything and reset the drive 
since my third PowerBook 150, a while ago. There was a utility, once, 
that actually reset the magnetics of the drive, i believe. So that it 
was returned to a true, pristine state.

My plan is to dump everything, do the most aggressive reformat 
possible, re-install Jag, upgrade it to current v., and then import 
my programs in a nice, orderly fashion.  Any brand-specific advice on 
software[s] that might help, greatly appreciated.

The anomalies have won the battle, i surrender...now what?
