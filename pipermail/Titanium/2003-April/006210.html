In my opinion this isn't an exact comparison.  What I mean is that sure 
each song is $0.99 and we can assume it's about $1.00 per track on a 
CD, but you can't buy a single track on a CD (except for some singles, 
which aren't usually $1.00).  So for the ability to download a single 
track/song you pay $0.99, but if you want the whole album its $9.99, 
less than $0.99 per track.

Anyway, somebody is probably making money on this, but much more than 
normal distribution channels?  I don't know.  It always seemed to me 
like CDs were too expensive, especially when I don't normally want the 
entire CD.  Putting the songs on a CD and shipping it to a store really 
don't add that much overhead.  And if you think the stores aren't 
making a nice markup on that shiny plastic disc, you've got to be 
kidding.

Anyway, I think it's a pretty good deal, and the price can only come 
down.  Another guess about the price, have you noticed that other music 
services (emusic) offer a monthly fee for unlimited music downloads, 
but have you noticed their selection?  From what I've seen they are 
pretty limited.  Other music services (Liquid Audio) offer a per song 
download service (Windows Only) but again selection is somewhat more 
garage band, and from what I understand you are limited in how you use 
the songs.

Apple has done a competitive job in my opinion, and has managed to get 
the backing of all 5 major music labels.  Pretty impressive if you ask 
me.

Thanks,

Jason Jensen
