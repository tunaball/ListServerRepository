<PRE>Lisbeth,

Both of his statements were incorrect. The Mac OS X kernel is NOT GNU  
licensed (it is BSD licensed). In fact, Mac OS X includes very little  
GNU code (because of the licensing issues). Had the kernel been GNU  
licensed, then it would have been problematic for Apple to keep parts  
of the operating system closed source.

Mac OS X is based on the BSD flavour of UNIX. The reference platform is  
FreeBSD (used to be NetBSD). There are many similarities between BSD  
and Linux but there are also many differences. BSD is a Unix system  
with very old roots (since the seventies) while Linux is &quot;younger&quot; and  
was founded in the nineties. Both are very mature operating systems by  
now.

Mac OS X is a bit different from other common BSD's in another way. It  
uses a Mach kernel, because of its NeXT heritage.

It should be noted that neither Mac OS X nor Linux are actually real  
Unices. But that is mainly because they haven't payed for the  
validation by the Open Group which owns the UNIX trademark.

One of the differences is that FreeBSD and Mac OS X both use ipfw as  
the firewall (which should be particularly interesting in this case). I  
believe the most common Linux firewall is ipchains.

/ Sincerely, David Remahl
