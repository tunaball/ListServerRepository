<PRE>I've had nothing but good experiences in the Cincinnati Applestore.  I 
was living overseas and called in my 'reservation' for the TiBook 667 
internal combo drive ahead of time, synchronizing a business trip there 
to the time that they would get the parts.  Two days later I picked up 
my Powerbook with the upgrade, and took off.  They were very 
understanding and accomodated ordering the parts just on my word that I 
would be there on the time I said I was going to be.

I did buy my Powerbook there and had them open it to check for Pixels, 
etc.  I was aware of the their restocking fee, and since I was taking 
it overseas, I wanted to be sure.

Just my 5cents.
