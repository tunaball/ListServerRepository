<PRE>Got this from another list. According to this, If you got an early 17&quot; 
model, be very very careful upon opening it up. Apparently the initial 
delays were caused by sticking hinges that caused the screen to crack 
when opening.


&lt;<A HREF="http://macnet2.com/more.php?id=322_0_1_0_M">http://macnet2.com/more.php?id=322_0_1_0_M</A>&gt;

excerpts:

&quot;What happened was this; I pressed the latch in front of the PowerBook 
to open it and found the latch wouldn&#8217;t let go. I wound up having to 
press my fingernail into the latch to get it released, and as I opened 
it I heard the faint sound of cracking.

Yes, you guessed it. My 17&#8221; PowerBook screen has shattered.&quot;

&quot; What I did NOT anticipate was Apple&#8217;s reaction to this obvious 
defect. After all, simply opening the PowerBook and having the screen 
crack on you cannot possibly be your own fault. Or can it? According to 
John, an Apple Product Specialist, apparently it is.

  You see, John told me in no uncertain terms that this didn&#8217;t happen 
the way I said it did. I suppose you could say I was called a liar. 
Screens don&#8217;t break, according to John. I was informed that Apple would 
in no way cover this under the warranty.

  The cost to repair this? One Thousand forty dollars.&quot;



&quot;I ran across the appended post at powerbookcentral.com. Apparently 
word from inside Apple leaked out that there was a problem with the 
screen not being mounted on a rigid enough backing, making it 
susceptible to cracking. This was&#160;discovered after usage of the first 
few made and manufacturing was immediately halted pending a solution. 
That explains the delays. If yours was one of the first few 
manufactured then that explains what happened. It also places the blame 
back on Apple. I'm surprised that some of your readers assumed that 
someone of your experience with computers and laptops would handle one 
rough enough to cause the breakage.&quot;
