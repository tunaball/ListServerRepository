<PRE>When I bought my powerbook from an apple dealer in Seattle I 
specifically had them open powerbook's to check the screen. I got lucky 
because the very last one there were prepared to open (the 2nd one) had 
a perfect screen. My approach was that if I'm buying from the the store 
and paying tax etc I will be walking out of here with a perfect screen.

They tried to make me accept the first box they'd opened but at that 
point I had paid for anything yet so they agreed to try one last time.

</I>&gt;<i> of there with a refund (less a 10% restocking fee), a bad taste in my

</I>&gt;<i> dead or stuck pixels).  The Apple Store will NOT get any of my

</I>&gt;<i> customer loyalty and patronage, I wouldn't HAVE a business.  I'm not 
</I>&gt;<i> going to switch to PCs over this, but I do not support any business 
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't treat me as I've treated them.
