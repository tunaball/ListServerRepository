<PRE>This encouraging note came from a friend with a Big Al PowerBook:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: PB 17&quot; and MS Bluetooth Mouse

I just thought I'd pass this great  experiences along:

I received my 17&quot; PowerBook G4 about a week ago and I can't even begin  to
describe how impressed I am with this machine.

But even more impressive was when I happened to see a Microsoft
Intellimouse Explorer Bluetooth mouse at Best Buy.  Despite all of the
resounding 'It won't work with a Mac' cries from the &quot;technical&quot; people  at
the store, as well as the lack of any Mac specific system  requirements on
the box, I purchased it given OS X's excellent track  record of handling
practically any hardware you can throw at it.  It  was a tad pricey at
$84.00 

The package itself contains a USB based bluetooth transceiver for  desktop
applications as well as a tiny USB transceiver for laptop use.   I ignored
those bits, and went right to the mouse and installed the  batteries.   I
went to the BlueTooth menu item of my PB and selected  'Setup Bluetooth
Device...'.  From there I was prompted to select what  type of device.  I
chose 'Mouse'.  A status window proceeded to appear  stating that my Mac was
searching for any BlueTooth devices in range.   Within a few
second...bingo...Microsoft Mouse appeared.

I selected it, hit O.K.  And, voila!  The mouse worked perfectly!  God  I
love OS X! 

Now I'm off to see if the included transceiver works with my Dual 800
QuickSilver.  If it does...that certainly helps offset the cost of the
mouse given the fact that the D-Link BlueTooth adaptor costs around  $40.00!

...I just tried the  BlueTooth transceiver that came with the Intellimouse
Explorer  Bluetooth package on my Dual 800 QuickSilver and...guess what...it
works like a charm!

So I have BlueTooth enabled my QuickSilver and gotten a really nice
BlueTooth mouse for $84.00..not too bad!
