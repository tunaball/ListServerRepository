OK, I admit I'm not a Windows type of guy, but I did a little quick 
research on &quot;Shared Sockets&quot;.  Not even close to NAT - with NAT, the 
router (in this case, your Ti running VPC) checks the routing table to 
see if it has an entry for the destination address from the stub 
domain.  If it does, the NAT router then translates the packet and 
creates an entry for it in the address translation table.  If the 
destination address is not in the routing table, the packet is dropped.

Shared Sockets is a Winsock v2 API.  I'm guess your problem is not with 
VirtualPC - it's with the Windows drivers for the emulated network 
interface, and possibly due to some carry over problems from VPC 5.0 in 
the saved images, or maybe proxy settings or something being 
incompatible.  If I knew more about Shared Sockets, I could probably be 
more clear.  In any case, I would try totally uninstalling the network 
devices in Windows, then reboot Windows and let it redetect the 
interface and reinstall it.  Do the full reboot - don't attempt to save 
image state or reinstall on the fly.  Even this does not guarantee 
success.  Windows is quite brain dead when it thinks it knows what the 
proper driver is for a piece of hardware, even if that driver is wrong. 
  I've installed NIC's in the past in a Windows box, and Windows 
installs the wrong driver.  Then uninstall the device in Device 
Manager, reinstall it and try to tell Windows what the right driver is, 
and it *still* insists on installing the wrong driver because it has it 
stored in it's driver database.

I really think it's a Windows problem, because VirtualPC 6.0 works for 
both me and Trevor using the Shared Networking (NAT) option, and it 
works for Trevor with the same setup you have there (your Ti hooked 
directly to a DSL modem).
