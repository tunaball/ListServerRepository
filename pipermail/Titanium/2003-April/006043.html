<PRE>Tarik Bilgin paused, thought it over, and spoke thusly:

&gt;<i>sorry had no idea flipper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>do you prefer SF?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>or san fran?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>what's derogatory about it out of interest?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think I got that name from Otis Redding's Sitting on the dock of the bay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>also another curious note -- the development webserver here is 
</I>&gt;<i>called frisco :)
</I>
Hi Tarik,

It's funny, but in all my life I've always heard it referred to as 
The City. In a way that LA would never be, same for Chicago, or New 
York City. I would imagine that gold miners started calling it 
'Frisco', but I could be wrong. For those who were born there it has 
always been a real 'outsiders' term. I didn't take your perfectly 
benign reference personally, I only pointed out the 'nature' of the 
word so that you could avoid it. I think a visit to the City would 
probably explain everything.

When I was young [around 7 or 8, my family visited their closest 
friends in the east bay, and even then, when we'd be returning, 
coming back from through the Oakland/Berkeley Hills, the first sight 
of the City, across the Bay, just sitting there, was amazing to me. 
It's terribly hard to explain.

As for dear, lost Otis, he had a way of saying frisco that didn't 
seem at all out of touch with his humane, soulful being. I had 
tickets to see him headline the New year's Eve show at the Winterland 
[a hockey rink that Bill Graham rented 6 nights a week, back in the 
day], the year Otis died in a plane crash. I believe he died in 
early-mid [?] December. The news was heartbreaking.

I'll wrap this way Off Topic thread with my assurance that i only 
passed the comment to you because i knew the usage of the slang was 
inadvertent. had it been otherwise, i would have ignored it. San 
Francisco is a multi-syllable word that pretty well 'begs' to be 
shortened, even i see that . :=)
