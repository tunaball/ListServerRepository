<PRE>Just wanted to vent a little...

Yesterday I purchase a new iMac from the Apple Store at Kenwood Towne 
Center in Cincinnati, got it home and found that there was a a pixel 
stuck on BRIGHT red near the center of my screen.  I researched Apple's 
website and found that it was within spec and Apple gave instructions 
on how to massage the screen in hopes that it would unstick.  I tried 
all of that, but to no avail.  Having just purchased it yesterday, I 
thought I would be able to go in and explain my dissatisfaction and 
exchange it--especially since I'm a very regular customer, having 
purchased a PowerBook, iBook, iPod, Palm Tungsten | T, Microsoft 
Office, digital camera, and various other software and peripherals.

Well...much to my dismay and disgust, they basically said &quot;tough shit.&quot; 
  Technically I understand that they were correct, but having purchased 
so many things there and having waited for them to get stock in when 
Microcenter had what I needed in stock, just so that I could purchase 
it from Apple and give them the business, I feel like my patronage is 
completely unappreciated.  Even after telling them that they didn't 
care.  I told them that if I walk out of there unsatisfied, they would 
be losing a lot of future business as I would never buy from them 
again.  They said it was my call.  So I walked out of there with a 
refund (less a 10% restocking fee), a bad taste in my mouth, and then 
went to Microcenter to buy my iMac (which is free of dead or stuck 
pixels).  The Apple Store will NOT get any of my business ever again.  
If I ran my business with their disregard for customer loyalty and 
patronage, I wouldn't HAVE a business.  I'm not going to switch to PCs 
over this, but I do not support any business that doesn't treat me as 
I've treated them.
