All of us do that, Sherman, which is why it took me so long to buy my Ti 800 last May.  I saw the Ti when it was first introduced at Macworld Expo in San Francisco, and wanted to buy one then.  However, I had been burned by Apple with my 5300ce/117, which was the top of the PowerBook line when I purchased it, and was determined never to have it happen again.  Thus, I waited and waited . . .

Finally, after most of the dead pixel, paint bubbling and other issues seemed to die down at this forum and others, I made the plunge.  However, I took a techie-friend with me to check the Ti before any money was paid; and even then, paint bubbling problems showed up, which Apple took care of.

I am impressed with the Apple Stores, as I said before, but I respectfully disagree that &quot;people in the US have been . . . conditioned to accept crappy customer service and crappy products.&quot;  Most of us vote with our wallets, and will not put up with lousy products OR service -- from Apple or any other company.  Sometimes I believe that Apple is getting that message; other times I believe Apple is tone deaf, possibly for the reason that Henry Kalir so eloquently described (i.e., &quot;a STABLE majority [of fools/customers] will do&quot;).
