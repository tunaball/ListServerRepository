We have discussed this before.  People have said that this is due to grease
from your fingers, but that is only partially true.  After awhile, these
marks will not wash off.  I believe they are actually due to the matte
surface being ground smooth by abrasion, caused by vibration during
transport.  Also, note that marks will come not only from the keyboard but
also from the trackpad edges and the trackpad button.

In past discussions, we have recommended that a piece of thin foam sheet,
cardboard or maybe paper, sized to cover the whole screen, be put inside the
powerbook whenever it is closed for transport.  If you want to be fancy, buy
one of these:

Since this is rather inconvenient to remove or install a sheet every time
you want to set up or put away your powerbook, we have also discussed on
this list the option of installing taller rubber bumpers, called &quot;bump-ons&quot;,
manufactured by 3M, available at Home Depot stores, which hold the screen a
little farther from the keyboard and trackpad.  This is certainly more
convenient, but there are several concerns with it.  (a) If the solution was
so simple, why hasn't Apple done this in later revs?  (b) The screen may
still flex enough to rub the keys and trackpad due to vibration during
transport.  (c) Compressing the taller rubber will put more stress on the
latch.

I also noticed that, after a year of use on my old 667, the original rubber
bumpers were worn down to nothing - they were flush!  Watch out for this.
