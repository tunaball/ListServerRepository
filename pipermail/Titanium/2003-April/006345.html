Even though I can't officially download from the store currently, I  
have been playing with the preview service, re-acquainting myself with  
familiar music just to see how far 200,000 songs extends.

One thing I have noticed is the dates of release of some material  
doesn't match original release dates, even though covers do, e.g.  
Bacharach albums are dated late '90s.

Also, is there any rhyme or reason to the snatch of music chosen as the  
preview....would someone have actually put the effort into choosing, or  
is it random? There seems to be some thought given to the process.

And finally, I wonder when the full story about how all this came about  
will be published? Seems to be it would make a great Harvard MBA case  
study - there is considerable &quot;depth&quot; to the story. This is not  
something thrown together at the last moment!
