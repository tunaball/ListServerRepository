<PRE>&gt;<i>Yesterday I purchase a new iMac from the Apple Store at Kenwood Towne Center in Cincinnati, got it home and found that there was a a pixel stuck on BRIGHT red near the center of my screen.  I researched Apple's website and found that it was within spec and Apple gave instructions on how to massage the screen in hopes that it would unstick.  I tried all of that, but to no avail.  Having just purchased it yesterday, I thought I would be able to go in and explain my dissatisfaction and exchange it--especially since I'm a very regular customer, having purchased a PowerBook, iBook, iPod, Palm Tungsten | T, Microsoft Office, digital camera, and various other software and peripherals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Well...much to my dismay and disgust, they basically said &quot;tough shit.&quot;
</I>
They probably said 'Sorry' but that wouldn't fit in with your rant.

&gt;<i> Technically I understand that they were correct, but having purchased so many things there and having waited for them to get stock in when Microcenter had what I needed in stock, just so that I could purchase it from Apple and give them the business, I feel like my patronage is completely unappreciated.  Even after telling them that they didn't care.  I told them that if I walk out of there unsatisfied, they would be losing a lot of future business as I would never buy from them again.  They said it was my call.  So I walked out of there with a refund (less a 10% restocking fee), a bad taste in my mouth, and then went to Microcenter to buy my iMac (which is free of dead or stuck pixels).
</I>
Are you willing to believe that the exact same thing would have happened if the screen at Microcenter had a bad pixel? The could have done nothing more than the Apple store had done.

IF that single bad pixel allowed you to not accept the product, are you thinking that they should just then give it to some other customer who has not spent as much money?

IF that single bad pixel makes the product unfit for sale, and Apple reworked every product that had a bad pixel like that, the cost for the computers would jump up considerably.

Are you aware that this bad pixel issue is handled similarly by all manufacturers? PC also?

&gt;<i>  The Apple Store will NOT get any of my business ever again.  If I ran my business with their disregard for customer loyalty and patronage, I wouldn't HAVE a business.  I'm not going to switch to PCs over this, but I do not support any business that doesn't treat me as I've treated them.

It's not true that married men live longer than single men. It only seems longer.
