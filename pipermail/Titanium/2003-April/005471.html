What I've found is that the drive motor fails to spool up.  The drive 
controller will attempt to initialize the drive 3 times, and if the 
motor fails to start, it will eject the disk.  The usual cause, as far 
as I can tell, is a long period of inactivity (you use the Ti, but 
don't use the CDROM/DVD drive).  I've &quot;fixed&quot; at least six of them 
owned by friends and myself (400's/500's) that were &quot;stuck&quot; using 
Lisbeth's method (sort of).  Immediately after the roller pulls the CD 
or DVD into the drive, and when it seats the disk on the spool, I 
smartly slap the computer, directly over the approximate center of the 
drive.  Almost without fail, the &quot;stuck&quot; drive will spool up and work.  
A couple of them took more than one attempt, but after they started 
working again they were OK as long as you used the drive at least once 
a week.
