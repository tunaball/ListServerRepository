David - I append my answer and offer from 9/2002 on this specific question.
The only update is that we moved, as anticipated, to ADSL/wireless in 
the ofice 9/2002, and I have never used my ISDN pcmcia card since. 
...... so you can have it !!
Perhaps we should pursue any details off-list.

regards,  Trevor

Subject: Re: [Ti] ISDN information


David - I use an ISDN card from Digicom (an Italian company) that 
goes in to the PC-card (pcmcia) slot on my Ti-500.  The card comes 
with a short cable 'adapter'.  One end plugs in to the card and the 
other receives the ISDN cable.

There are just a few Digicom drivers (modem scripts) to &quot;install&quot;.

Since 10.1.5, this card has been recognized by OS X.  Under 10.1.5, I 
used to get regular (once per day) kernel panics, which seem to be 
related to the software associated with the PC-card slot.  But since 
10.2, I have not had a kernel panic, nor any other issue that relates 
to the PC-card slot.  I am using ISDN all day every day in the 
office, at 128 kbps (the wireless ADSL will be 256 kbps)

I am also moving to ADSL.  I have done so at home.  That was 
completely painless.  I am just in the process of doing so in the 
office (just as soon as SwissCom get their act together).

I hope that answers your question.  Maybe I can go further, and 
suggest that my ISDN card might soon be &quot;on the market&quot; if you are 
interested to have it, or we could just arrange for you to borrow it. 
Of course, I might have to come to Greece for a week to install it 
for you...... :-)

regards,  Trevor
