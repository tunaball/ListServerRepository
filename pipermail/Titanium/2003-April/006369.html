<PRE>On Mon, Apr 28, 2003, Trevor J. Hutley <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">hutley at geneva-link.ch</A>, invoked
powers within the internet realm, to proclaim ...

&gt;<i>I just discovered - Easter weekend - that my very nice Apple bag that 
</I>&gt;<i>came with my Powerbook 3400c in March 1997 is just fine for me 15.2&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>Titanium Powerbook, and because the Ti is so thin, I have room for 
</I>&gt;<i>about 1&quot;  of documnents as well.
</I>
I never thought I'd spend so much money on a backpack. But, the day I
bought my 15'2 PowerBook, I also bought a Brenthaven backpack. I had to
save for quite a while for my PowerBook and had a lot of software in need
of updating once I bought it, so the original plan was to get the
PowerBook home and THEN find something to carry it in. But as I was
standing there in the local Apple Store, I looked at the backpacks on
display and thought my TiBook deserved to be well-protected, so I bought one.

I take care of my TiBook, but every time I tuck my TiBook into my
BrentHaven backpack, I feel like the over-protective mommy in me can
relax. I never put anything in the padded section along with my TiBook. I
don't even put anything in there when my TiBook isn't in there. There
have been times when I've stuffed quite a bit of stuff in the back
compartment. Sometimes, I'm amazed and thrilled when I can fit a jacket,
umbrella, half-inch soft bound school book, my Starbucks coffee cup,
snacks, and an envelope containing the 100 (sometimes more) pages of
stuff I've just printed off the internet.

This backpack keeps clean and still looks new. The rubber handle at the
top doesn't look stretched or tugged on at all and is the first backpack
I've owned that that handle doesn't dig into my palms when I lift it when
the pack is heavy with weight. All the seams look unused. I know I've
only had it since February, but I've bought dozens of backpacks that
started to show wear and tear within weeks.

There are a lot of backpacks made for portables, but I'm so pleased with
this one that I'd like another in a few months - though I'd like one that
slings over the shoulder. I also know that there's little chance that I'd
buy one over the internet. I do a lot of shopping over the internet, but
there's nothing like being able to do a hands-on inspection to make sure
it will be an exceptionally secure home for my TiBook. I take my TiBook
to work and school, the library, and out-of-town trips, so it is nice
that my backpack is one less thing to worry about.
