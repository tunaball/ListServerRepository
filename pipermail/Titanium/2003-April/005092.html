Well, there's a few things to look at. Win2k also doesn't connect for 
me in VPC 6.

They both connect fine in VPC 5. So, how could the internal net 
settings, in 'Saved&quot; Drive images, be at fault, when both images 
connect instantaneously when relaunched in VPC 5 ??? I mean, one of 
the first things Windows, any config, any OS does, on launch, is: Set 
networking, and then Load personal settings...  This seems to 
suggest, to me, that the vastly different result in operation is in 
the emulator, not the 'guest'.

I already monitored incoming/outgoing traffic in both setups, using 
both OS sets... same deal.. as more page calls were made, the 
outgoing bytes increased dramatically, yet the incoming traffic 
stopped around 1270 bytes, until it was obvious that the VPC 6 setup 
was not going to work. And all the while it reported itself as being 
DHCP Enabled, using Shared networking.

As I said, the only apparent difference was the &quot;Sockets Shared 
networking&quot; 'default', in VPC 5.0.4 and since i don't have Airport 
Extreme, a known 'killer' conflict with XP in VPC, there's nothing to 
do at this point.

In addition to the netdump, I used run to do a config release, etc, 
and the release and re-setup made no difference, either.

XP is a dog, Chris, i agree. But VPC 6 bills itself as 'optimized' 
for the NT-based OS. optimized? broken seems more accurate. as i said 
i am grateful for help, and still have the XP installer AND the 
service Pack 1 updater AND the Q-patch from MS to undo some of the 
slowness in the xpsp1_x86 'upgrade'... all safely tucked away on the 
CDs. I'm okay with Win2k pro, no question, to my experience it's lean 
and mean compared to XP.
