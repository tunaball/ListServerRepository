<PRE>Michael Bigley paused, thought it over, and spoke thusly:

&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;Apparently Steve Jobs hates Jeb Bush
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I doubt that has anything to do with it. It has more to do with warranty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>laws in Florida.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>With Al Gore on the board, who knows, haha!
</I>&gt;<i>Actually, to be a little more direct, it is most likely consumer 
</I>&gt;<i>protection laws in Florida. I would imagine with the large 
</I>&gt;<i>population of senior citizens, Florida is a denizen for &quot;carpet 
</I>&gt;<i>baggers&quot; and grifters.  My guess is the AARP lobby has worked in FLA 
</I>&gt;<i>to enact a rigid consumer protection law that forces folks like 
</I>&gt;<i>Apple to void their standard warranty there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is not uncommon, as it is often heard or seen in the late-nite 
</I>&gt;<i>insurance commercials things like &quot;this offer not available to 
</I>&gt;<i>residents of...&quot;  Sometimes I wish they would include Ohio in those 
</I>&gt;<i>things ;-)
</I>
All of the hospital and rehab industry in Florida, which are both 
HUGE, is one big insurance game. it would be naive to think that Fla 
has some hyper-compassionate attitude towards any particular 
demographic down here.

Take a look at a seemingly unrelated situation: Quebec, specifically 
Montreal. They had the largest underground telemarketing/grand 
larceny operations in the english-speaking world [in a 
french-speaking province, ironic, eh?]. Yet the companies involved 
were, on the one hand, banned from calling fellow Quebeckers, and, on 
the other hand, tipped-off by 'dirty' [think Serpico, not unwashed] 
RCMP Fraud Division officers, as to how much larceny was 'tolerable'. 
It wasn't until States Attorney's General got the FBI involved, that 
things started to change in Montreal. It was a case of do it to the 
outsiders, fine, just lay off us.... Florida is hardly any different.

I seriously doubt that J. Bush has a clue who Steve jobs is. The bush 
boys are both running on room temperature IQs and neither has had a 
thought that wasn't spoon-fed to them, in their lives.
