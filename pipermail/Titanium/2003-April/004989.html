<PRE>According to Michael Bigley:

&gt;<i>Can't recall where I read this (came over a Watson/Meerkat 
</I>&gt;<i>newsfeed), but adding substance to that rumor is that OSX will only 
</I>&gt;<i>run on the new Itanium chip, to prevent Pentium users from reverse 
</I>&gt;<i>engineering the OS.  It fits with Jobs' &quot;new and whizzy&quot; approach to 
</I>&gt;<i>things; also the article noted that since Apple pulled the clone 
</I>&gt;<i>agreement with Motorola, there has been bad blood, hence the G5 chip 
</I>&gt;<i>being over a year and a half late on projected release; Motorola has 
</I>&gt;<i>also been slow in producing chips which has caused some production 
</I>&gt;<i>wrinkles in current Apple lines... not sure about the IBM version.
</I>
Nobody is using Itaniums... they cost three grand apiece right 
now...what would that make an iMac, uh, how much? I figure the 
low-end would move out of taiwan at about 4100 US.. sound like a 
smart move? And what about heat? Even a scaled-down chip from Intel 
would involve tremendous heat, and heat kills performance, all in the 
name of misleading CPU 'speed'. Bad idea, there's enough Dells out in 
the dorms doing double-duty as hot plates, already.

Apple, from the look of it, has used a devoted base, and 
higher-priced hardware to subsidize software engineering... what 
happens to the cash cow when people can run a $130 OS on a lowest 
common denominator Intel box? here's a hint: First, they'll need a 
support call center the size of Bombay to field all the probs with 
cheap PCs... and the Apple name will go down, down, down.

A history of a few marketing blunders is no justification for another 
one. Motorola has shifted back to its cash cow, namely 
microprocessors for phones, so they're out... i expect to see the new 
IBMs in new Apples, by MacWorld SF  [assuming there is a Macworld SF, 
of course]

The idea is so lame, they'd have to bring back that Pepsi guy to get it going.

That toad, what's his name/ Dvorak, that's the one.. he likes this 
idea... if that doesn't expose it as a lamebrainer, nothing will.

Although, after screwing around in the wintel world, I can't blame 
them for wanting a real OS on their boxes. Their just going to have 
to buy a Mac... simple.
