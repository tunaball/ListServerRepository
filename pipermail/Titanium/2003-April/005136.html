<PRE>
I already saw my first 12&quot; Al-book a few weeks ago, in action, 
recording a meeting I was at.

Today, I visited a technical company (electronic instrumentation) 
just over the border in France, and was pleased to see an iBook as I 
came in, followed by a bunch of brand new iMacs (just delivered, 
under test, before being put in to service), and then I saw the 12&quot; 
Al book.  The owner had never used Mac before and said he was 
surprised how easy it was to use.  It certainly looked good.

The company owner has Macs everywhere (about 20 of them).  He said it 
takes him one hour a week to do support and system work on all of 
them.  He has a few PCs around for work that can only be done on them 
(some Autocad stuff, apparently).  He estimated that if he was &quot;PC&quot; 
throughout, he would need to employ a full-time person to do the 
support and system work.....

All the above was incidental to my visit, but made the visit 
particularly enjoyable.

have a good weekend,  Trevor
