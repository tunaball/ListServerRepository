<PRE>This is not something to take lightly.  When I was on a all expense paid 

vac. by the US Army in Vietnam 33 years ago we were called to look at a
Navy site south of Saigon that kept going down. This being the very old 
days of computers we had a communications system that kept track of 
errors and would shut down when it hit X number of them and you would 
have to restart the system.

Well the Navy could not figure out what the problem was so they called 
in the Air Force tech's first and they could not find out what was going 
on so they said &quot;for fun let's see what the army can find&quot;  As I was the 
new guy that time, I went along to carry the extra circuit boards and 
hand them tools as needed.  But every time I would lean up on the rack 
that held the equipment I would get shocked!!! So after this happened a 
couple of times I said &quot;look at this guys&quot; we put a multimeter on the 
rack and had voltage....  To make a long story short they had to dig a 
new ground for the comm center to correct the problem.....
