<PRE>According to Michael Bigley:

&gt;&gt;<i>  And, last but not least, many apps work perfectly well without 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>their 'added-in' items that show up in 'Login Items', also in Sys 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Prefs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I tried deleting all login items but no change in time
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Also, and i cannot stress enough, even a 'light', or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>'moderate'-rated amount of disk fragmentation will slow down boot 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>times. Always. no exceptions. My restarts and 'cold' boots are, on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>average, 20 to 25% faster after defragging. For a file system, OSX, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that sports a 'myth' that fragmentation 'isn't an issue', I have to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>wonder, based on consistent, real-world results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I suppose this could be an issue, the finder could be trying to wade 
</I>&gt;<i>through a bunch of fragged files; I will post this question on the 
</I>&gt;<i>OSX Tech list to see if someone can give me a rational explanation 
</I>&gt;<i>of why OSX or the Finder does not handle the UNIX defragmentation 
</I>&gt;<i>process properly.
</I>
Glad to hear that the GlobalPrefs business shaved a minute off boot time.

Perhaps you could do a verbose boot/  Just hit Command-V on reboot or 
startup, and wait,the screen goes black and scrolls like a madman, 
but should log the items that are having to be re-polled, or showing 
as &quot;couldn't access&quot;, etc. Food for thought. it's too bad that the 
verbosity [as it were] isn't available from Logon to Finder full-op 
status.

I would trash all Finder and SystemPrefs, and try again. Do a fsck -y 
boot [Cmd-S] and if there was any repair by the internal file check, 
run fsck -y again, until XXXX Appears to be okay&quot; shows up.

I had similar lengthy Finder probs [very slow drawing of Menu, or 
slow mounting of desktop picture + , etc. At one point i booted into 
OS 9 and did a search for all DS_Stores files [thousands, as many as 
you have volumes and the folders in them, and trashed the whole lot. 
The next boot was slow, and the one following: rapid, as it should 
be. There are many low-ramification 'fixes' that will, in some combo, 
fix the system. I say low-ramification, meaning zero -to very low 
'attrition'.
