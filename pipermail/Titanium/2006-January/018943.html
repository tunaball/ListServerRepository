Interesting you mention this. I go to college (almost out!) in the  
Mechanical Engineering department, and most of the professors are  
using macs+PCs. Practically all the admin computers are mac (as far  
as I can tell). I would say the younger professors are predominantly  
using windows.

There was a time I had hoped Unigraphics would have been ported to OS  
X, for the G5, but that kind of died out. I was able to use it on a  
mac by ssh'ing into a Unix machine in X-11 (but of course, the Unix  
machine was doing the work). Let's just say it was worthless to use  
it this way.

Let's put it this way: Every CD-ROM I've received in a book supports  
Windows. It is rare a CD also supports Mac. The ones that do are  
built (usually) in PDF, html, or Director format. I could probably  
say to my professor, &quot;I'd like to take your books application, and  
write a Mac OSX version of it.&quot; He might say go ahead. I have no idea  
how to write software properly, so I wouldn't do it. BUT, it's simple  
enough that someone here could write the app in a few days. There are  
java apps on the web the duplicate the program, but are very clunky.
