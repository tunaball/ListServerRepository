Yes, true.

But I for one would want to see a computer produced that works right  
out of the box ... and indeed improves with time (that is, it figures  
out in short order that when you said &quot;tomahto&quot; you meant to say  
&quot;tomayto&quot;, as it were, and with time adapt to all your other  
idiosyncrasies, the way a good human secretary would.

Ah, so true, so true.


Oh well Cheers anyway.
