THIS business runs on Mac.  Most people don't know or care whether  
the computer they are using is running Windows, Mac OS, Linux, or  
MyFavoriteOS. They just need to get their work done.  Yes, there are  
5 programs on Windows for 1 on the Mac, but generally the 1 on the  
Mac is either the market leader on Windows, or is so much better than  
what is on Windows that it isn't even funny (don't even get me  
started about how Windows developers tend to use their customers to  
&quot;find all of the bugs&quot; their &quot;release&quot; software).

If people absolutely need to use Windows, it is because they are  
using some specialized, vertical-market application.  Everything else  
has options on the Mac as well as Windows.  In fact, Microsoft even  
says their Mac version of Office is better than their Windows version.

If I wanted to make as much money from supporting my customers as  
possible, I'd recommend Windows to them (and charge for support).  If  
I wanted something that let them get their work done, I'd recommend  
either Mac or Linux -- and most likely Macs because they can GET  
support for the hardware.
