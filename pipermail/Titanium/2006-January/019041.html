That's exactly it. The same applies to many other activities. I for  
example am an avid photographer, and can appreciate the differences  
between different cameras. My camera collection has cost me upwards  
of $2,000 (I have seven of them, all different sizes, from a sub- 
miniature Minox to a 4x5 in. Speed Graphic - all bought used on eBay,  
because I can't afford new). I get gorgeous enlargements made  
professionally, up to 2 x 3 ft. in size - and one even larger - each  
at considerable expense. Other people, those who want only 4x6 in.  
snapshots costing mere pennies each, couldn't care less about their  
photos ... and so couldn't care less about their cameras either.

If one is serious about one's work, one ought to be serious about the  
tools that enable one to get one's work done. If one is not serious  
about one's work, on the other hand ...
