&gt;<i> &gt; When my PB G4 HD crashed more than a year ago, Apple replaced the HD

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all of my software and files, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I find that many times I would like to run Classic but it isn't there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How does one overcome the lack of Classic on the new MacBooks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The OS9 install should be available on your System discs that came with your
</I>&gt;<i> PB G4.
</I>

Yes, but Apple told me then that to have Classic, I would have to do a
clean install of OS9 and erase everything that I had just reinstalled.

As you can appreciate, when the HD crashed it hit like a ton of
bricks.  I even sent the failed HD to DriveSavers in Novato, CA, in
the hopes of recovering lost data, but I wasted about $1,000 in doing
so.

Thus, the idea of doing a clean install to put in Classic has not been
music to my ears.  That is why I was hoping that the new MacBook Pros
would come with it pre-installed.



&gt;<i> The inability to run Classic is Apple's method of finally stopping support
</I>&gt;<i> for Classic. This is similar to Microsoft's method of stopping support of
</I>&gt;<i> Windows 95 and 98.
</I>


Yes, I understand that, but I have some CD-ROMs that require Classic to run.



&gt;<i> I just bought a Mac Mini 1.5GHz G4 for the sole purpose of running a couple
</I>&gt;<i> of my Classic programs.
</I>


Interesting.



&gt;<i> There are still G4s and G5s available online so they are still for sale.
</I>&gt;<i> Apple also extended their deal with Freescale to ensure that there is a
</I>&gt;<i> supply of PowerPC motherboards available to cover AppleCare services.
</I>


My PowerBook G4 is great, thank God, but the next move is the new
MacBook Pro, after the bugs have been worked out of it.



&gt;<i> &gt; Any thoughts about the new version of MS Word/Office that apparently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be coming in a month or so?  Word is critical to my work, and I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assume it will handle earlier versions of Word .docs (e.g., as far
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back as 5.1)?
</I>&gt;<i> I believe Office has had a very good track record when it comes to
</I>&gt;<i> supporting old Office/Word documents.
</I>


And I assume the newest Office/Word for the MacBook Pro will be
compatible with documents created on all earlier versions of Word for
the Mac -- hopefully.  :-)

Thanks, Wilson, for your comments.
