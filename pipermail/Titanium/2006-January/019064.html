&gt;&gt;<i> It was a permissions issue.
</I>&gt;<i> But what issues did you actually have? Can you be more vague, please? The
</I>&gt;<i> quality of your posts will reflect the quality of responses I'm afraid.
</I>&gt;<i> They were not then &quot;we're using special permissions&quot; then? So what were they?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Which I could NOT fix while booted from my main drive.
</I>
Can I be more vague?

I am sure I could be but it was certainly un-intentional.

&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DID seem to work okay when booted from the CD.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's not because permissions can't be fixed while booted from the main
</I>&gt;<i> drive, but because the correct permissions from the CD/DVD *are
</I>&gt;<i> different* from you main drive (unless you have the exact same
</I>&gt;<i> incremental version on both). What part of that did you not understand?
</I>
It was NOT explained as clearly as you just did, therefore I did not
understand the issue.

&gt;<i> Are permissions OK now, if you run Disk Utility while booted from the
</I>&gt;<i> main drive? Did yo have other problems related to this one?
</I>
No, permissions are not okay.  I get MULTIPLE errors which do not get
repaired even though I run it several times the errors are always the same,
disk utility SAYS it has repaired the problem but they are still then when I
rerun.

Here are some of the reported issues:-

We are using special permissions for the file or directory
./Library/Widgets/Unit Converter.wdgt/UnitConverter.js.  New permissions are
33188
We are using special permissions for the file or directory
./Library/Widgets/Unit Converter.wdgt/parser.js.  New permissions are 33188
We are using special permissions for the file or directory
./Library/Widgets/Unit Converter.wdgt/version.plist.  New permissions are
33188
We are using special permissions for the file or directory
./Library/Widgets/Weather.wdgt/Default.png.  New permissions are 33188
We are using special permissions for the file or directory
./Library/Widgets/Weather.wdgt/Info.plist.  New permissions are 33188
We are using special permissions for the file or directory
./Library/Widgets/Weather.wdgt/Weather.js.  New permissions are 33188
We are using special permissions for the file or directory
./Library/Widgets/Weather.wdgt/parser.js.  New permissions are 33188
We are using special permissions for the file or directory
./Library/Widgets/Weather.wdgt/version.plist.  New permissions are 33188
We are using special permissions for the file or directory
./Library/Widgets/World Clock.wdgt/Info.plist.  New permissions are 33188

Most of the problems seem to be in my Widgets folder but also my DVD
application is affected.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And WHY do you keep a digest subject? Just because you subscribe to the
</I>&gt;<i> digest don't give you reason to break the proper subject.
</I>
I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about?
