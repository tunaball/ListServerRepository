Does it really? Or is it marketing that is the cause of these &quot;many  
more millions of deployments&quot;?

Speaking as a certified scientist and an amateur logician, I  
*personally* would not accept &quot;many more millions of deployments&quot; as  
proof of anything ... except, of course, of many more millions of  
deployments. But then again, maybe that's just me.

</I>
I was speaking of *reliability*: not of moving over &quot;from revision to  
revision&quot;. OIOW, I was wondering how many times the average Windows  
user has to stop the work he is doing to solve computer problems, as  
compared with the average Mac user.

</I>
I dunno about that. I can still use all the OS 7.2 software I bought  
for my Performa back in 1997!

&gt;<i> Reliability in Enterprise and business has way factors than just  
</I>&gt;<i> technical excellence.
</I>
No doubt. But I was just wondering in my post which platform is the  
more reliable, not which is the technically more excellent. (I *know*  
that the Mac OS is technically more excellent than Windows!)


Cheers.
