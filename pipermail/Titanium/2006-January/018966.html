<PRE>A guy in perhaps his early 40's walked into our offices about a month  
ago for a SuperDrive upgrade on his 15&quot; Aluminum PB G4.  He works at  
Cisco and had driven up from San Diego.  He mentioned that nearly all  
of Cisco works on PCs but that there is a fast-growing group of Mac  
users there.  He said that he had been using Windows since he started  
his career but that he has &quot;never been so productive&quot; since he  
switched to Mac and started using his PowerBook G4.  He said that,  
unlike so many of his colleagues there, he very rarely has to spend  
any time troubleshooting his machine and the vast majority of his  
time is spent getting real work done.

That is not common experience so it proves nothing about general
computing (what's that really?) outside of your personal experience.  
Macs
have their fair share of problems. Macs still are way easier to use and
get into, even for quite demanding circumstances, for people that are  
not
computer-oriented, but Pros within their field.
