Gosh it would be more useful if we stayed on topic. but here's my zero 
cents worth.
People want cheap that's why now almost everything we buy is made 
outside USA.
Windows setup is cheaper and less quality made just compare design and 
internals and so on including frequency of repair, support costs and 
replacement and so on, not including what seems weekly patches from 
from Microsoft for what might be termed poor bloated programming, Maybe 
the Lexus and Ford comparison works you have heard it before, Fords are 
cheaper and of course have built in less quality. It is interesting 
that the Mac division of MS always has had superior products because 
they hire mac people with higher built in (their minds) quality 
standards, of course MS seems to be killing that part off slowly. More 
often Mac developers have put their product through more rigorous 
testing before reaching the market (this may slowly be changing on some 
products thought) this is why you have to update MS products again so 
much they are less integrated to the variety of internals you may get 
on an HP, Sony and so on.

I worked with a medium sized web development company for a year I came 
in and used Macs they saw my work was does quicker and often better 
especially graphics than the windows counter parts. Then for some 
reason (they did not have an answer to this) they said we must use MS 
stuff that lasted a short time I quit and they are out of business in 
that area now.

Those who know both sides of the whole story as I, having used MS stuff 
and PCs to a moderate extent too. Will always choose a Mac if they have 
a choice.

can we get back to on topic discussion?
