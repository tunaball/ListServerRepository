Most Windows users figure that viruses, spyware, continual security  
updates, and constant reboots are just the way things are on  
computers, and that their problems are simply because they don't know  
how to use a computer.

However I'll agree with you -- most people don't really care what  
platform that they use, as long as it is something that they know.

And people complained about &quot;single source&quot; with Apple...and refused  
to acknowledge that they had a single source in Microsoft, because it  
was &quot;Dell Microsoft,&quot; &quot;Gateway Microsoft,&quot; or &quot;Compaq Microsoft.&quot;

However, this still doesn't prevent me from trying to explain and  
demonstrate to people that Macs are as powerful and significantly  
easy to use -- and they don't have to worry about &quot;the other shoe  
dropping.&quot;
