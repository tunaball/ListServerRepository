<PRE>I've been talking about personal purchases, primarily.

Most IT departments are a lost cause.  Having been around them most  
of my career, they are about Job Security(tm), first and foremost.   
If another platform came along that had all of the software they  
needed but required more people to support, and they could justify it  
financially (ie. the hardware is SO much cheaper), they'd switch in a  
heartbeat.

I have yet to meet a traditional IT manager who wouldn't want more  
people in their department.  Right now most are soldiering on with  
fewer people than they need simply because Accounting managers have  
started to realize that IT is a black hole -- it sucks up all the  
money that is surrounding it for very little service.

Oh and Chris, properly written software doesn't break from version to  
version (except from 10.0 to 10.1, where 10.0 pretty much sucked).  I  
have quite a bit more software that is &quot;10.1 or later&quot; -- and doesn't  
break because of &quot;library changes&quot; (and there have been some) between  
versions of the OS.  For example, Apple made available to developers  
what libraries routines were defined in, but then told them to use  
the Carbon or Cocoa umbrella framework, just in case they moved  
things.  Some developers thought they were being clever and decided  
to use the specific libraries instead.  When Apple moved some APIs  
from one library to another, those who listened to Apple and wrote  
using Carbon or Cocoa continued to work.  Those who were &quot;being  
clever&quot; found their software broken and having angry customers.
