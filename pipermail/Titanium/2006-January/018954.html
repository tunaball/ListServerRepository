<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Lisbeth Zachs &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">zachs at swedenmail.com</A>&gt;
</I>

Thanks, Lisbeth. for your comments below:


&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, but Apple told me then that to have Classic, I would have to do a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clean install of OS9 and erase everything that I had just reinstalled.
</I>&gt;<i> ---------
</I>&gt;<i> What Apple didn't do was to format the new HD so that an OS 9 system
</I>&gt;<i> could be installed and started from. But you should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> install the Classic version within OS 10 even if they made that silly
</I>&gt;<i> mistake of not checking the OS 9 option box. Or so I thought. Anybody
</I>&gt;<i> certain about it one way or other?
</I>

Obviously I don't want to make a mistake, so I welcome your advice and
that of others.



&gt;<i> &gt; Thus, the idea of doing a clean install to put in Classic has not been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; music to my ears.  That is why I was hoping that the new MacBook Pros
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would come with it pre-installed.
</I>&gt;<i> --------
</I>&gt;<i> By now you should have learnt to have a backup HD
</I>


Yes, this is my fifth PowerBook, and everything is backed up. 
Essential files were backed up when the crash occurred too, but Apple
told me that DriveSavers was terrific so I thought they might be able
to save everything, which was not the case at all, and they were a
colossal waste of money.  They claim &quot;Industry-Leading 90% Success
Rate,&quot; but my HD must have fallen into the 10 percent fail rate.  :-)



&gt;<i> and so you may just
</I>&gt;<i> as well do a Carbon Copy Clone of your disc to an external HD or a
</I>&gt;<i> SuperDuper backup or any other backup application you choose. Check
</I>&gt;<i> that you can start from the external backup and then format your
</I>&gt;<i> internal disc, Check the OS 9 alternative when formatting and then
</I>&gt;<i> clone your material back from the external HD. Yes it may take an
</I>&gt;<i> evening or so when you cant reach your Mac, but you dont have to sit
</I>&gt;<i> their waiting. I think CCC at least reports what time the cloning
</I>&gt;<i> will take and you can take a healthy walk in the meantime. :-) Or
</I>&gt;<i> someting.
</I>

I hate to plead ignorance, but what you just said flies right over my
head.  I have no earthly idea how to do any of that.


&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, I understand that, but I have some CD-ROMs that require
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Classic to run.
</I>&gt;<i> ---------
</I>&gt;<i> Do they require Classic or is it that they need a Mac started in OS
</I>&gt;<i> 9? There is a difference there. What happens when you insert them. Do
</I>&gt;<i> they try to start the Classic you don't have or simply get rejected?
</I>

Let me give you a perfect example.  I have &quot;109 Years of National
Geographic Magazine on CD-ROM,&quot; which consists of lots of CDs.  To the
best of my knowledge, they are not offering the package anymore.

When I inserted one of the disks just now and tried to launch the
installer, the following message appeared: &quot;Classic cannot find a Mac
OS 9 system folder on the startup disk to use.&quot;  A button also
appeared, which says, &quot;Open Classic Preferences,&quot; and I cannot do that
because Classic is not installed.


&gt;<i> If you really don't want to do a backup exercise (which you really
</I>&gt;<i> ought to do in my opinion) I think you should test to do the Classic
</I>&gt;<i> install from your OS 10 discs unless someone on this list can say
</I>&gt;<i> for certain that even that alternative requires a checked OS 9 system
</I>&gt;<i> at the HD format.
</I>

I was told by Apple that Classic had to be installed before everything
else, and that they screwed up when they put in the new HD.


&gt;<i> &gt; Office/Word for the MacBook Pro will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compatible with documents created on all earlier versions of Word
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the Mac -- hopefully.  :-)
</I>&gt;<i> ----------
</I>&gt;<i> All versions would certainly be to ask too much. I doubt they even
</I>&gt;<i> handle 5.1 and lower than that I can't even imagine they will.
</I>

So far, Office/Word seem to handle all documents produced in earlier
versions, which is terrific.  Hopefully that continues to be the case
when the new Office/Word is released for the MacBook Pro.

Thanks again, Lisbeth.
