<PRE>Item 1. Classic will NOT run on the MacBook Pro until a emulator is  
made. Apple has firmly stated Classic will not be supported.
On the new Powerbooks that will not boot OS9 there is  a Classic  
(OS9) installer on one of the disks supplied with the computer. On  
older computers that will boot into OS9 If you boot from an OS9  
Install disk, you have to do a &quot;clean install&quot;, but the term Clean  
does not mean it deletes any data on the drive or affect the OSX  
system.  What a Clean Install does is Retitle the old System Folder  
(if there is one) to a Previous System Folder and install a new  
system folder. No data is disturbed.  I have done this on a number of  
customer computers and it works fine.
In my opinion Classic has served it time and should be let loose into  
the great beyond. You can still get cross country in a covered wagon,  
but a new car will get you there faster and in more comfort.  
Pagemaker was great but InDesign is better. Most other mainstream  
applications have upgraded and old data files will still run in the  
upgraded application. The only constant in the world is change.

</I>&gt;<i> Check that you can start from the external backup and then format

</I>&gt;<i> sit their waiting. I think CCC at least reports what time the  
</I>&gt;<i> cloning will take and you can take a healthy walk in the  
</I>&gt;<i> meantime. :-) Or someting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I understand that, but I have some CD-ROMs that require  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Classic to run.
</I>&gt;<i> ---------
</I>&gt;<i> Do they require Classic or is it that they need a Mac started in OS  
</I>&gt;<i> 9? There is a difference there. What happens when you insert them.  
</I>&gt;<i> Do they try to start the Classic you don't have or simply get  
</I>&gt;<i> rejected?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you really don't want to do a backup exercise (which you really  
</I>&gt;<i> ought to do in my opinion) I think you should test to do the  
</I>&gt;<i> Classic install from your  OS 10 discs unless someone on this list  
</I>&gt;<i> can say for certain that even that alternative requires a checked  
</I>&gt;<i> OS 9 system at the HD format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Office/Word for the MacBook Pro will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compatible with documents created on all earlier versions of Word  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the Mac -- hopefully.  :-)
</I>&gt;<i> ----------
</I>&gt;<i> All versions would certainly be to ask too much. I doubt they even
