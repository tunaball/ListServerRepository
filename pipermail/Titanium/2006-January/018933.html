None of those sound like &quot;doing normal everyday stuff.&quot;

BTW, I've been able to BSOD Windows XP just unplugging SUPPORTED USB  
devices (with drivers provided AND SIGNED by Microsoft).  It's gotten  
better in the last three or four months, but I still don't unplug  
those devices because there have been no updated drivers.  I've also  
had Microsoft drivers render hardware inoperable, and something that  
MS does prevents the vendor drivers from installing or working  
correctly without a complete reinstall.

WXP is significantly better than previous versions of Windows, W2K  
included.  For those people who absolutely NEED to use Windows, it's  
the best option.  However a lot of &quot;Windows recommendations&quot; come  
with a big &quot;string&quot; -- generally the &quot;the recommender is going to  
provide support, for a cost&quot; string.  However, a lot of companies' in- 
house support groups are recommending AGAINST updating to WXP.  Why?   
Because it requires LESS support than other versions of Windows!  
(empire-building and job security)  I personally would ask anyone  
recommending Windows if they would also provide full, FREE support  
for at least the next year.  Watch how many &quot;back off&quot; that Windows  
recommendation, or refuse to provide the support.

I won't even mention the FUDsters who state that they can get (read:  
build) a stable, usable Windows machine for significantly less than a  
Mac.  Having designed Intel machines and built quite a few myself, I  
know the truth: Wintel machines are only marginally less expensive  
than Macs.  When you factor in all of the additional software and  
time you will need to keep your Wintel machine running and secure,  
that &quot;savings&quot; is now &quot;additional cost&quot; (unless, of course, your time  
is worth nothing -- but then why are you getting paid to work?).

Oh, and there are other CAD/CAM packages besides AutoCAD.  Just  
because it is the most installed (hence, the &quot;defacto standard&quot;)  
doesn't make it the best, just the most used (and I have friends who  
AutoDesk).
