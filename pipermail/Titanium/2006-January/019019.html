<PRE>Glenn L. Austin said:

&gt;<i>Most people really don't care what they use, as long as it does &quot;X,  
</I>&gt;<i>Y, and Z.&quot;
</I>My point, which seems to completely elude you, was that the fact that
people are often ignorant about alternatives or alternative better ways
of doing things, doesn't mean they don't care what they use. Again, it's
not the same thing.

Most business people, as far as I can tell from personal experience (not
meant to be a blanket statement or proving anything), care very much
about that they use what they percieve &quot;everyone else is using&quot;. Perhaps,
it need to do something, like &quot;X&quot;, but they never thought they could do
&quot;X&quot; with great joy and in half the time, because they never question what
Windows gurus tell them to use. If they're lucky the Windows guru care
about productivity, but I find that is seldom the case.
Also, most business people, again as far as I can tell from personal
experience, never thought of &quot;Y&quot; either, unless someone told them.

Of course, all this depends as always on what your actual needs are and
how aware you're of them. Many people are not aware of what they need at
all. They just use computers, because they think that's how to to &quot;work&quot;.
Somehow they manage to do some &quot;work&quot;. 

Yes, I exaggerate a bit to get my point across, but not by much.
