<PRE>&gt;<i> So I've got a 1.67 ghz pb with 1 gig of ram and it was running very  
</I>&gt;<i> very slowly so I recently
</I>&gt;<i> added SPOTLIGHT=-NO- to /etc/hostconfig rebooted and it seems to be  
</I>&gt;<i> running a lot faster now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Has anybody turned off spotlight had this experience?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One problem is search in Mail.app isn't enabled anymore but I maybe  
</I>&gt;<i> able to live without that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally I'd like be able to update my indexes nightly and turn off  
</I>&gt;<i> real time updating if this is the culprit for the slowness I was  
</I>&gt;<i> seeing.
</I>
There was an issue earlier on, Spotlight would take up all available  
CPU -&gt; however, I think this was fixed. Are you running the &quot;latest  
and greatest&quot; updates? This happened to me, and since then, Spotlight  
has settled down. Not specifically Spotlight, but a process related  
to Spotlight would keep running and running.

I too would like the option of turning off real-time indexing - it  
would help troubleshoot any speed issues people at work complain about!
