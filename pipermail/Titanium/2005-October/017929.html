I'm a brand new convert to Mac, having just gotten a TiG4 1GHz w/  
512MB. I have to admit that spotlight turned on and everything that  
it is still a lot faster than the PC I was working on previously. I  
never really noticed any 'slowness', aside from running Photoshop/ 
Illustrator which seems to be pretty pokey on so little ram. The only  
thing I've really wound up doing is getting rid of all the Dashboard  
widgets. I did not particularly appreciate each individual widget  
eating up something like 10MB of memory.

Given the amount I actually use spotlight though, I might bother  
trying this.
