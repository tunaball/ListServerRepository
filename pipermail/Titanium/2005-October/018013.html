<PRE>Well, Trevor, in Greece the less expensive price i got is 114.50 Euro  
or &#163;77.50 or 176.90 CHF ... So you do understand now what i mean that  
the Greek market is expensive.
That's why i mostly make all my buys on electronics, english books  
and other things through e-shops around the world - mostly US and the  
UK, since i know only Greek and English and too few Italian and i can  
only read these ;-) -

It is absolutely hilarious that what i order from even the US gets to  
me in less price with even the expenses and customs and all at fewer  
prices than the one i can buy them from here!!!
That is hilarious!!! And that becomes a greater reason when it comes  
to Macs as all the country is help by one company &quot;Rainbow Computers&quot;  
who doesn't seem to care for their business...

Too expensive rates, the worst service ... everything bad... I wish I  
had the money to be able to bring macintosh products myself and sell  
them at the lowest cost i could to raise the market of Macs in Greece.
We are so few here in Greece that we mostly know one another by  
name!!! Imagine...

The huge use is made at newspapers  and magazines that respect  
themselves and use mac for the design at least.

That's all for now ... thank you for your kind replies ...

Out of topic: You live in a very beautiful country... I love the  
mountains and the fresh air you mostly get at Switzerland...

CKougar

P.S. I ordered the WAG54GS ... they told me that i might have it next  
week ... let's see
