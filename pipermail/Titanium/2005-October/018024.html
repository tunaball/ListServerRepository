<PRE>Dr. Hutley,

I would say that it is likely that you are simply running up against  
the capacity limits of the DVD.  While the theoretical limit is  
4.7GB, things like directory structures, as well as lead ins and lead  
outs, take up significant  amounts of space... and this can vary  
depending on whether you are saving lots of little files or a few  
large files.

The fact that you got 4.17GB on the disk and that the DVD works fine  
indicates to me that it just ran out of space.  Toast generally does  
a good job of estimating how much it can fit onto a particular type  
of media but it may have overshot slightly and so when your DVD drive  
started saying it was out of space Toast just halted and came back  
with the errors you saw... obviously not handling it very gracefully.

As you saw, lowering your data to 4.0GB solved the problem.  In the  
future just keep an eye on things when your data surpasses the 4GB or  
4.1GB point.

The suggestion to try installing Patchburn does not apply here.   
Patchburn is a nice utility that basically tells the Mac OS to go  
ahead and provide burn support to non-Apple drives so they can be  
used with iTunes, Finder Burning etc.  But it does not interact with  
Toast which has its own set of drivers.

I'd say that your first guess that the problem stems from a bug in  
Toast is right on in that Toast's estimation of how much space your  
data would actually take up on the DVD were slightly off.

Al-Powerbook, OS X 10.4.2

I am making backups/archives of many of my files on to DVD using  
Roxio Toast 6 Titanium 611.

I made several this morning.

When I was making a backup of my eyeTV files, I got this error message:

         The drive reported an error:
         Sense Key = HARDWARE ERROR
         Sense Code = 0x03

then

         The drive reported an error:
         Sense Key = ILLEGAL REQUEST
         Sense CoDe = 0x30, 0x05
         CANNOT WRITE MEDIUM - INCOMPATIBLE FORMAT

about 90% of the way through writing the DVD.

It seems that 4.17 of the 4.2 Gb of files was in fact copied, and the  
DVD works fine.  There are perhaps a few files not copied.

Does anyone have any idea what these error codes mean, and their true  
significance?

I am using Imation DVD-R 8x but only burning at 1x.

This happened when I put another DVD in and repeated the burn, so it  
was not the DVD media (unless both are defective in the same way).
I then tried one DVD from the bottom of the spindle, to see if it is  
the same.  It was.  4 min 14' left to burn, same error message.

Next, I tried reducing the size of the DVD content to just 4.0 Gb,  
from 4,2.
No problem....

How do we explain that ?  Bug in Toast?

regards,  Trevor
