<PRE>Man, what a trying experience the last 24 hours has been! I finally bit 
the bullet last night and decided to spring for the new 15&quot; AlBook that 
I've had my eye on these last few months. As I qualify for the federal 
government discount, I went to Apple's online store, ordered up my 
fully loaded BTO PB, and threw in a few accessories (iSight and 
Keynote) for good measure. I finalized the order and went to bed, 
thinking all was well.

My dreams of PowerBook bliss were dashed this morning when I awoke to 
find an e-mail from Apple saying that they were unable to verify my 
credit card information, so I needed to call one of their payment 
specialists. You see, I'm currently assigned overseas, which makes it 
very difficult sometimes with ordering -- forms often don't recognize 
my APO zip code -- and purchasing items. Some companies just flat out 
refuse to ship to APO addresses. Apple, unfortunately, is one of them. 
In my attempt to circumvent this problem, I listed a shipping address 
with family in the States, thinking I would just get them to forward 
the PB to me when it arrives. Unfortunately, this tripped a sensor in 
the credit card verification process. To make a long story short, after 
several international calls from Japan to my credit card company and to 
Apple, I was unable to resolve the situation. I was weary of Apple's 
inflexibility and tired of watching my federal discount savings get 
eaten away by phone bills. I decided to cut my losses and try 
elsewhere.

Enter SmallDog. I've used them before, and I really like their business 
values, service, and friendly approach. They also ship with no problem 
to APO addresses. Earlier this evening I went ahead and ordered my PB 
through them, forgoing the govt. discount. I'd rather pay a little more 
and help out the little guy anyway. Of course, as luck would have it 
though, instead of the 1-3 day availability that Apple showed, the 
SmallDog website just said &quot;Backordered&quot; for the 15 inch. Well, as long 
as it doesn't have white spots, I don't mind waiting a little.

So, here I sit on Christmas Eve, anxiously awaiting shipping 
confirmation from SmallDog. Man, all you folks back home don't know how 
easy you've got it! ;-)

Here's wishing you happy holidays, and thanks for letting me bother you 
with my predicament. It's been truly cathartic.
