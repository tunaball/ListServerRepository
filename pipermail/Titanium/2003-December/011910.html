Eric - after reading this thread, I thought I would just check out 
and test the audio lione in (mic) on my 15.2&quot; Al -Powerbook, which 
definitely has an audio line-in, which I have not used so far.  I 
plan to use it for VoIP, soon ....

I have just recently bought a headset/mic for use with VoIP in the office.

I connected this to the line-in, opened the Sound panel in my System 
Preferences and selected Input.

The built-in microphone seems to have a sound level, as shown in the 
panel, right around the mid-level.

HOWEVER when I select lin-in, there is NOTHING.
No movement on the &quot;meter&quot; at all.
The gain is set at maximum.

So now I am back home, where I have another, higher quality headset/mic.
I connected this to the line-in, but again the Sound panel shows nothing.

Assuming the chance that both headsets are broken 'as purchased' is 
pretty small, I have to assume that there is something wrong with my 
set-up.  I am not aware of any other changes I can make.

Is there anyone with a 3.5 mm jack line-in mic that is working OK 
with a regular microphone?

Or anyone who knows of an explanation for my observations?

regards,  Trevor
