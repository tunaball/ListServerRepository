<PRE>Hello!
    my name is eric, I have a Ti 800 dvi, and registered to the list 
recently.
I would like to wish a merry Xmas to all members. I bought my first mac 
in 86, for my 15 years old daughter. I found it very nice but didn't 
&quot;get it&quot; until the start of internet service in Brasil, but now I am 
getting to another stage: I am putting together a WiFi hotspot in my 
cafe restaurant on the riverside in Belem do Par&#225;.
    And it is an all Apple installation; Free access to customers, six 
iBooks for renting to customers, a 17&quot; iMac 800 as main server, a base 
station (white) and Airport cards all around, on a 512 ADSL link. ( 
Except for mi poor TiBook, I had to buy a Cisco card for it, as the 
built in antenna gave it a range of about 30 cm... )
    Anyway, to make a long story short and happy, I found by pure luck a 
young FreeBSD master, lent him one of the iBooks, and he took to X like 
a fish to water. So I have a great IT Manager ( thank you, my good star 
), and it's great because I know I could never do it by myself. I guess 
I discovered computers too late, after frying too many neurons first.
    My worst problem in things mac
   
    So, as my first contribution to the list, (sorry it's a negative 
one) this link seems broken (at least on my digest):  
&lt;&lt;<A HREF="http://www.drbott.com/prod/alist/USB.html">http://www.drbott.com/prod/alist/USB.html</A>&gt;&gt;
I get a 404 with this detail:     Apache/1.3.27 Server at www.drbott.com 
Port 16080
   
    And I also have a question: &quot;Is it safe?&quot; &quot;Is it safe?&quot; &quot;Is it 
safe?&quot; ( to buy a new 15&quot; Al Book, as I prefer to wait
until a new model has at least one or two revisions under its belt 
before buying, and white spots and other scary stories made me skittish)

    Well, thank you if you did read all this, and I look forward to 
hearing from all.

best,

eric
