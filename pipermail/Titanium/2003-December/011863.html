<PRE>On Sun, Dec 28, 2003, the following words from Phillip McGree
<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">phil at phil.net.au</A>, emerged from a plethora of SPAM ...

&gt;<i>I fell asleep really early tonight, whilst laying on my bed watching tv.
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't mean to doze off so early, and so hadn't locked the front door.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I woke up at about 3:30am and noticed that there was someone in my
</I>&gt;<i>bedroom (I live alone).  In that first few seconds I have recognised that
</I>&gt;<i>there were two unfamiliar people in front of me, looking as startled as
</I>I was.

It can often be very dangerous to wake up while the burglars are still in
your home. I am glad to hear that your PowerBook wasn't stolen and
especially that you weren't harmed by the intruders. I hope the police
catch them and recover your property.

There have been many times that I've been home alone, but I've got four
dogs who are more than happy to bark in alarm if anyone even steps on the
sidewalk. I just came home from walking one of my dogs (Reba is my baby,
so I take her for walks alone as a treat.) and as it is dark out, I
always feel much safer with her. Before I got her years ago, I did not
feel comfortable even being in the front yard because I've had too many
people approach me with bad intentions whether on the street or in my
yard - especially after dark. As we approached the last few houses from
my home, a man cam walking around his parked car to get in and Reba
started barking ready to defend me. The guy looked scared because he had
not seen her when he sauntered towards me until he had gotten too close
and my dog let him know that he'd better not be up to something.

By the way, if you registered your digital camera, you should still have
the serial number or could get them from Canon if you don't have it
written down somewhere.

Good luck.
