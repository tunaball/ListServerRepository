<PRE>OK, it's time to clear up some confusion...
First of all, using a disk formatting utility to zero all data will NOT 
give a speed increase.  When formatting a hard drive normally, the 
computer just replaces the catalog of all existing files with a blank 
one.  The data for all the files is still there, but as far as the 
computer is concerned, there is no difference between a spot on the 
disk that doesn't hold a file and is a sequence of zeros and ones, and 
a spot that doesn't hold a file and is all zeros.  In short, there is 
NO difference between formatting normally, and formatting with zero all 
data.
Regarding Journaling, it is probably a good idea to have it on.  It 
should help speed up booting after a crash, and it will help prevent 
major directory corruption.  The way the journal works is this: every 
time the computer is about to make a change to the disk, it writes a 
note to the journal saying quickly what it's about to do.  It then 
completes the operation, and then deletes the note in the journal.  If 
the computer crashes, it will find a note in the journal telling it the 
last thing it was doing, but never finished.  It can undo this partial 
operation, rather than having to go through and check every single part 
of the directory structure for corruption (which the built-in disk 
check can't always do well anyway).  There shouldn't be a noticeable 
speed hit.
Regarding Classic, it is unnecessary for many people.  I have not had 
classic installed on my computer for a long time; probably at least a 
year and a half now.  I installed Panther, Jaguar, and all updates for 
each with no classic system folder.  I have not encountered any 
installers or anything else that I need that require classic to be 
installed.  I would recommend keeping Classic around for a few months 
and make sure that you never use it over that period of time, and after 
that, you can probably pretty safely trash it.  There are no Apple 
installers that I know of in recent history that don't work due to 
classic not being installed.  The only exceptions I can think of were 
during 10.1 and 10.0, when a few unusual updaters (for things such as 
firmware in various components, etc.) were released.  I have since seen 
these same things done natively in OS X with no need for Classic.
Regarding computers that can't boot into OS 9; the version of Classic 
that is installed on them is enough to boot any OS 9-compatible Mac.  
The reason why these latest computers can't boot the same version of OS 
9 is that the OS needs to be updated for each new model of computer 
that is made; making these updates costs Apple a good chunk of money, 
plus it makes the OS more complicated (some computers won't boot from 
anything but the OS CD they shipped with).  On an OS that is no longer 
being developed, this is a waste, so Apple stopped updating the OS for 
each new architecture they build.  For this reason, OS 9 won't boot on 
newer machines.  It's nothing explicitly set by the installer, nor is 
it anything malicious by Apple to make people upgrade.

Hope that helps everybody a little bit,


&gt;<i> I just installed Panther on my iBook 366SE. I like it. I want to give
</I>&gt;<i> OS9 the kiss of death to free up my now precious HD area. How do I
</I>&gt;<i> remove OS9 and other files and programs I no longer need?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it as simple as dragging the folder into the trash?
</I>
