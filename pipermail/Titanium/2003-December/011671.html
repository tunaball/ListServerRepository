I am not sure I understand the exact technical detail of what is going 
on from what you have given us, but I will make some stabs in the dark:

1) Since POP mail seems to work for manual IP addresses, you could ask 
the support team to assign your Powerbook a fixed IP address which 
would then mean you could use it manually instead of with a DHCP 
server. Have you asked them if the POP server will only respond to 
certain IP addresses as an authentication measure? If this is true you 
will need a manual IP address to collect your mail.

2) If they tell you that doesn't matter - make sure that the DNS server 
IP is the gateway IP address.

a) Once you have done this try the following:

open a terminal and try:

ping nameofmailserver.domain.suffix

ping x.x.x.x (where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the mailserver)

If you can ping in both of these situations (you should see some 
responses when you do the ping) then try telling mail.app the details 
of your POP3 account, and compare for any glaring details with the 
Outlook/PC version.

You will see in the advanced tab there is a port number. This is 99.99% 
port 110  for most mail servers but your environment may use a 
different port (I seem to remember SSL authenticating mail servers use 
220 by default).

Furthermore perhaps your mail server is using SSL to authenticate 
itself to you and then to encrypt the data (seems unlikely they encrypt 
in Saudi where there are very strict rules on keeping communications 
secret) and if this is the case you need to tick the box in 
Accounts/Advanced and enter the relevant info (you need to speak to 
your support again to get this).

Sorry this wasn't a simple quick answer but from the info you provided 
it wasn't clear what the issue is.
