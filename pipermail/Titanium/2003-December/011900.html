<PRE>I have to believe this happens everywhere...  A number of years ago, I 
knew somebody that worked in a UPS facility, and he readily admitted to 
throwing every single package that he touched.  For a similar show, go 
watch an airplane get loaded up.  In many places, you can watch them 
drop several items right off the plane when they miss the conveyor 
belt.  No wonder airlines won't cover any damage to the outside of your 
suitcase.

Several times I have flown with my cello; not a cheap instrument, 
unfortunately, and very easily damaged.  I spent well over an hour 
packing it...  Loosening the strings just a little (but not too much, 
or the soundpost can fall), packing every square inch of open space in 
the case with socks and towels to keep things from getting banged 
around too much, then sealing the case and wrapping it in bubble 
wrap...  I was lucky in one of the travels (both were with an 
orchestra), in that they put all of our large instruments into a 
container to be loaded directly onto the plane, and not bounced around 
on conveyor belts.  Even so, when a relative travelled across the 
country to loan me a much better cello, we purchased a seat on the 
plane for it, rather than risk getting it dropped.

It's too bad there are so many people that just don't care for other 
people's property.  These same people often don't take care of their 
own things either, so at least they're not being discriminatory...
