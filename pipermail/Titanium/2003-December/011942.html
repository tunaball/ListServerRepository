<PRE>Happy holidays everyone.

Back in the days when I was touring with a rap group. I had these 
custom cases made for the set up (no turntables). Part of the rig 
that we would take on board was a 3 tiered keyboard stand and an 
apple IIe.
We didn't have to buy extra seats tho, we would book empty flights 
and couldn't fly on certain planes (one where the overheads weren't 
long enough for the dismantled keyboard stand to fit.

As far as service it comes down where your at and who you know. Once 
when I was staying at a house that was just built in the middle of 
nowhere and not on any maps, Fed Ex and AirBourne went out of thier 
way getting me packages. Airbourne sent one driver who knew where it 
might be to meet another who had no idea to find it, Fed Ex had one 
employee wait after work for the truck to come back that had the 
package and couldn't find it so that they could bring it back that 
evening. It didn't get there till about 11 that night.  I make sure I 
get cool with every delivery person that service me. It makes a 
difference. UPS and FedEx cats I know well, and they will come back 
twice in the same day if the dispatcher catches them in time. 
Airborne drivers change up, so If I miss them it's a wrap till the 
next day.

If you are sending something of your own that is of value, make sure 
you insure it. When it gets to you, open it and inspect it before you 
sign for it. If it is damaged, refuse and file a claim. If it is a 
valuable, cherished item, irreplaceable item, it really is better to 
buy a seat for it.

I NEVER use UPS for anything but packages of things that can't break. 
I have heard too many horror stories about getting UPS to cover 
damages.
