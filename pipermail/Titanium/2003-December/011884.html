</I>Anyone who has done any amount of online purchasing probably has some horror
story about a carrier, I certainly do. But I had an AirBorne experience that
put me right off them. One of their hubs is about 20 minutes from where I
live and one summer I worked for Micro Warehouse which has a huge
warehouse/repair center in the industrial park next to the AirBorne complex.

To make a long story short, I missed deadline on a repair for an important
client and once I was finished the shop manager had me hustle the package
over to AirBorne to see if it could still make the flight. When I walked
onto the sorting floor I was absolutely amazed by what I saw. There was an
army of men and women taking packages from feeder conveyer belts and hand
sorting them onto other conveyer lines or huge bins. I saw packages clearly
marked &quot;fragile&quot; being tossed like medicine balls across the floor. I even
saw a guy purposely drop a monitor box and say, &quot;I bet this won't work now!&quot;

I don't know how representative that was but whenever possible, today I
specify a carrier other than airborne.
