<PRE>Jerry,
    Last month  I upgraded the harddrive in my 800 MHz Ti with no 
problem.  (I installed a 100 G  Seagate  Ultra ATA/100 5400 rpm.)
When I looked on the web for your harddrive, I didn't find any 
information on it.  Not by Google; not on the Toshiba website; not at 
Accelerate your Mac.com  [xlr8yourmac.com]    Did you buy a used drive? 

    Assuming the drive itself is good, there are probably only 2 things 
that can go wrong.  Either you don't get the cabling seated on the 
harddrive and on the board   or  the jumper settings are set wrong.   I 
just used the factory default settings on my new drive and it worked 
fine.  If you open it again, check to make sure everything is really 
seated snugly and then check the jumper settings.  Set to master, not 
slave, not cable select.
     The only other thing I can think to try would be to initializing 
the drive again.  Boot from your CD, get into the Disk Utility, See if 
you can click on the icon that says Partition.  If you can't  (or if it 
does not appear)  try clicking on the icon for the CD you booted from.  
(Don't worry, you can't erase it or format over it.)  Once it sees the 
CD, see if  Disk Utility can see the new  drive.  If so, click on it  
and you have it made.
     Good luck.
               Paula

Subject: [Ti] Is there a trick to replacing a hard drive?

   We have a 867 MHz Ti.  The 40 GB hard drive was making noises and the 
system
was freezing.  Since we don't use this for much, I bought a 20 GB ATA 
hard
drive on eBay and replaced it.  Everything went together fine, but when 
I
boot off our Tiger install DVD and open Disk Utility to format the new
drive, it ain't there.  It's also not there in System Profiler &gt; ATA.

Did I miss a step?  I've checked the connector twice to verify that I 
did
not offset any of the pins.

It is a Toshiba MK20118GAP, HDD2164.  It also says COMPAQ P/N 
249493-001.

Did I get a bad hard drive?  Is the downsizing from 40 GB to 20 GB 
possibly
illegal?

Jerry
