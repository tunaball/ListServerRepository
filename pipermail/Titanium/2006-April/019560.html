I feel your pain. I sent the following on March 30, and as far as I can tell
it still hasn't come through (if others got it, I apologize, but I never saw
it arrive)...

--- Re: [Ti] From TiBook to MacBook: two questions ---

Thanks to all, and sorry for the delay in answering. Too much going on.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Thanks, Bill. I swap ports constantly and still get eventual new freezes. It
dawned on me that it doesn't happen with my Apple mouse, but just with my
old Kensington. I'm thinking that upgrading the Kensington mouse might do
the trick.

</I>Thanks, Trevor! My TiBook gave me such bad screen problems that I'm hesitant
to not use any kind of screen protection, but if you aren't using anything
and not seeing any marks, that's good enough for me.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I agree, Ardeshir. The marks were mostly invisible when the screen was dark,
but in the right conditions they were oppressive.

I have to say again that I *always* had a piece of leather between the
keyboard and screen, and the marks still appeared. This seems to contradict
the common notion that the marks are caused by finger oils. I think it's
more of heat transfer issue.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Henry, I also loved my 1 GHz TiBook and used it day and night for years
despite its screen flaws.

As for the MacBook experience, well, I think it's a wonderful machine, but
it doesn't have the SOUL of the TiBook.

Sure it's fast, well-made, pretty to look at...but it lacks something in the
hardware department (and I can't quite put my finger on it!).

For starters, I *hate* Apple's new silver keys and wish I had my old dark
gray keys back; I just can't see these as well. It somehow feels a bit more
fragile, and it's certainly more temperamental: once put to sleep it wants
to keep sleeping. It runs so hot I can't keep it in my lap. I dislike the
side ports and wish they were in the back, and I miss being able to flip up
the keyboard for access and cleaning (although I love the overall feel of
the keyboard and the backlighting!). The trackpad is horrible, often
hesitating, and not as responsive as the TiBook&#185;s. I know a lot of these
complaints also apply to the G4 AlBooks, but I never got to use of those and
only have the TiBook to compare.

On the upside, it *is* fast, although not as fast as I anticipated. I like
the built in iSight, but dislike having a much wider top edge to accommodate
it. The sound seems better, and the magnetic power adapter is excellent
(although the cord is horrible...thicker, heavier, and prone to heavy
kinks). It's quiet, thin, light, and sexy...but somehow the TiBook was
designed better. It felt like a friend and not a piece of art. It had a
personality where the MacBook does not. Does that make sense?

Thanks again for all the input!

Bill
