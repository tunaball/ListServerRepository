While opening 40+ applications at once may not be something that happens all
the time (if ever), it definitely demonstrates a point.  How different
processors and operating systems deal with load is a very important issue that
often is left unaddressed in the face of artificial benchmarks.  If you do one
thing at a time, Intel processors are quite fast.  If doing a single-thread
compile, even my 1.86GHz ThinkPad running Linux cranks out the builds in a big
hurry.  Try doing anything else with that box at the same time, though, and
you're in for a very unpleasant experience.

My 2x2 G5, much like all the Sun hardware I use, isn't as fast as the latest
Intel offerings in the various benchmarks.  So, everyone thinks, &quot;Wow,
Motorola/IBM/SPARC sucks, because you can buy this cheap-o Intel PC for much
less, and it cranks out big benchmark numbers!&quot;  But, the performance
degradation under load is linear and smooth.

Real world examples?  For me, doing a big compile while trying to download and
convert images from my digital camera, or working with Photoshop/iView and
downloading/filtering lots of email, or ripping a CD and ftping a file,
etc. work smoothly on the PowerMac.  Similar operations under Windows cause
things to basically stop, and/or get so chunky as to be useless.

This was my big complaint about going from SCSI to IDE - same problem.  IDE
works great if you're the only one doing something with the drive, and are only
doing one thing.  Try doing that compile, and watch how useless your computer
gets as it starts paging/swapping.

In a nutshell, it's not all about the ultimate numbers if you plan on doing
more than one thing at a time with your machine.  I'm big on multitasking, so
for me, it's more important that the system as a whole functions quickly and
smoothly, as opposed to just one single process.
