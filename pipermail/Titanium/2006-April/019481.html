<PRE>Don't bother trying to behave, David - nobody here does!  Even those  
of us that, on occasion, try to remind folks of the rules.  ;-)

My first suggestion; remove any non-Apple RAM.  If that doesn't do  
the trick, replace all the RAM with known-good RAM.  If you have two  
DIMMs installed, it should suffice to try only one at a time.  Make  
sure that you try them in different sockets too, because sometimes  
the socket itself can be the problem.

After that, it looks like you've tried all the typical software  
troubleshooting.  You might also try booting from the OS X Install  
CD, and see whether you can sleep while booted from that - I'd  
suspect not.

It is also possible to reload the firmware; shut down the PowerBook,  
then press and hold Command and Power until you hear a long beep.   
You should also see a little progress bar as it works.

It is possible that the PMU could be bad; there are two parts that  
you can try replacing.  The backup battery, located under the optical  
drive, should be a fairly inexpensive part, if you can find it online  
somewhere.  The other possibility is the logic board; you might be  
able to find a broken TiBook (same revision and same speed) on eBay  
with a working logic board.  Otherwise, Apple has a flat-rate repair  
service.  Send in the PowerBook, and they'll fix it for a set price,  
no matter what has to be replaced.  Whether it's worth that cost just  
to get sleep back is something you'll have to decide.

&gt;<i> I am new to the list, I will try to behave ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My query relates to a G4 667 PBook which has developed a sleep  
</I>&gt;<i> issue. I
</I>&gt;<i> have owned this pb for about 9 months, when I got it it &quot;slept&quot; fine.
</I>&gt;<i> About 3 months ago I noticed that it would NOT wake from sleep. My
</I>&gt;<i> feelings subsequent were that the sleep issue developed after a  
</I>&gt;<i> routine
</I>&gt;<i> OSX update, but I am not totally convinced. Unfortunately my  
</I>&gt;<i> partner was
</I>&gt;<i> using the pb more often than me so I can't say exactly when it  
</I>&gt;<i> happened
</I>&gt;<i> or in what circumstances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After some investigations I decided to reformat and re-install. I did
</I>&gt;<i> try all the pram, PMU and OF resets, to no avail. I was extremely
</I>&gt;<i> disappointed to discover the new system behaved exactly the same way,
</I>&gt;<i> ie, no matter how the unit is put to sleep (closing lid, power button,
</I>&gt;<i> time setting, menu select) it refuses to wake. The little led doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> pulse and the only recovery method is a power reset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Summarising...
</I>&gt;<i> PB g4 667
</I>&gt;<i> 500MB ram, 30 gig HD, current Apple firmware, OSX
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Doesn't recover from sleep in OSX 10.3.9 thru to 10.4.6, or in OS9.
</I>&gt;<i> Also doesn't recover from &quot;suspend&quot; under Ubuntu Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas would be extremely welcome :) My thoughts are that something
</I>&gt;<i> has gone astray with the pmu, I would like to be able to re-install  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> firmware but that isn't an option using the Apple installer. In all
</I>&gt;<i> other respects the pb works fine.
