<PRE>Well, I haven't used it often - and I used to work at an Apple  
Authorized Service Provider, so it's not like I didn't have a lot of  
opportunities to try it.  Basically, I'd say that if there's  
something that would lead you to believe there are hardware problems,  
it might be worth a try.  I'd like to hear back if it did anything  
for the sleep issue...  It might also be worth testing if a computer  
isn't booting, although there probably aren't many cases where the  
computer will power on enough to reload firmware, but not enough to  
boot.

I believe the key combo will be whatever is normally used on the  
machine to install a firmware update.  This might be just holding  
power, command and power, or the interrupt button and power.

I wouldn't try it unless it's your absolute last hope; as in, your  
next step is to send it in to Apple to get repaired.  Ideally, it  
shouldn't be a problem, but if something goes wrong, I suppose it  
could leave your computer unable to boot.  Specifically, power  
outages could be very detrimental.  The only times I used it is when  
I'm already planning on replacing the logic board to fix some  
problem, and it's one last thing to try on the off chance that it works.

Basically what I'm saying is - you'll almost certainly never need to  
use it.  ;-)
