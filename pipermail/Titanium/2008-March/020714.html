<PRE>Hi Steve,

I have made almost all of the changes you stated. The only one I couldn't find is the following:
&quot;You  need to make sure your router is set to use only &quot;b&quot; mode.  It is  
probably set to &quot;g&quot; and that is why the Mac is not seeing it.&quot;

Could not find were to change from g to b.

Regards,
Mike

From: Scott Strehlow &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">strehlow at usermail.com</A>&gt;
&gt;<i> &gt; Found the following.  Guess I need to buy the card. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Wireless Card Type:	AirPort
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Wireless Card Locale:	USA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Wireless Card Firmware Version:	9.52
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Current Wireless Network:	wireless network not available
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, you have a card.  It is the 802.11b version (11 Mbits/sec).  You  
</I>&gt;<i> need to make sure your router is set to use only &quot;b&quot; mode.  It is  
</I>&gt;<i> probably set to &quot;g&quot; and that is why the Mac is not seeing it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Log into the router's configuration tools.  From any machine you have  
</I>&gt;<i> that is connected (preferably by wire), open a browser and go to the  
</I>&gt;<i> IP address of the router.  If you don't know what that is, check the  
</I>&gt;<i> network setup on the PC and look for the &quot;default gateway&quot; or  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;router&quot; address.  If you cannot find that, then take the IP of the  
</I>&gt;<i> PC itself and change the last number to 0 or 1.  One of those is most  
</I>&gt;<i> likely the right address.  These are very common address  
</I>&gt;<i> assignments:  198.162.1.0, 198.162.1.1, 198.162.2.2, 198.162.2.1
</I>&gt;<i> I have a Belkin router and its address is 198.162.2.1.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After you put that address in the browser's address bar, hit return.   
</I>&gt;<i> You should see the status screen of your router.  If not, try the  
</I>&gt;<i> other variant of the address.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once here, look around for the wireless network configuration  
</I>&gt;<i> section.  If you don't have an admin password on your router, create  
</I>&gt;<i> one.  If you are not using WPA security, set it to that if available  
</I>&gt;<i> on all of your computers.  WEP is pretty useless as it can be broken  
</I>&gt;<i> with just a few minutes of listening and the right software.  It is  
</I>&gt;<i> better than nothing though.  Pick an encryption key which is pretty  
</I>&gt;<i> random and contains letters, numbers, and punctuation.  Make it as  
</I>&gt;<i> long as is practical.  Mine is 63 characters, but 13 is probably  
</I>&gt;<i> enough.  If you must use WEP then it will have to be a specific  
</I>&gt;<i> length (which I can't remember).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Find the wireless channel setting and make sure the Mac is set to the  
</I>&gt;<i> same channel.  If the SSID is still the default that was in the  
</I>&gt;<i> router when it shipped, change it.  For example &quot;Mike_Private&quot; or  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;KEEP_OUT&quot; or something similar would be good.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is why working from a wired computer is helpful as you won't  
</I>&gt;<i> keep losing connectivity while making these changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then set the PCs to these new settings, and go through the wizard on  
</I>&gt;<i> the Mac.  When you first try setting it up, put the Mac in the same  
</I>&gt;<i> room as the router to eliminate signal-strength as a variable to deal  
</I>&gt;<i> with if you have connection problems.  Once it connects there, then  
</I>&gt;<i> move to whatever place you want to use it and then worry about the  
</I>&gt;<i> signal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope that helps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Scott
