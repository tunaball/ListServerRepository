<PRE>Agree with both Lisbeth and John Griffin on this.

First attempt to fully backup before attempting 
to use DiskWarrior. I am not a huge fan of 
TechTool Pro except for identifying hardware 
issues but couldn't and wouldn't try without 
DiskWarrior. After Apple's Disk First Aid, a and 
then a separate DVD boot disk repair, DiskWarrior 
is the next arrow out of the quiver. It has 
*always* fixed every problem that other software 
utilities couldn't. It needs to be run off any 
firewire connected Mac or bootable DVD for your 
Mac.

Granted, I am ALWAYS fully backed up with 
scheduled daily/nightly mirror backups of all my 
systems. &quot;What's the difference between a car 
crash and a HD crash? With a HD crash, you know 
you're dead!&quot;  I learned a valuable lesson after 
a close call with a HD failure. Years ago, 
(Nov.1988) when a 60MB SuperMac external SCSI 
drive (yes that was 60MB not GB) started acting 
flaky and had to return it for warranty coverage. 
The drive via a Mac SE (with two floppy drives) 
had been religiously and fully backed up with the 
use of *85* floppy disks. Well, it had grown to 
85 floppies (800K disks) with its dynamic sized 
backup. I used an early DiskFit program which was 
a forerunner to Retrospect. The warranty SuperMac 
drive returned completely replaced, formatted and 
devoid of *any* of my previous data. I sat down 
and ran DiskFit and fully restored the HD with 
those 85 (800K) floppies. That close brush with 
disaster forever burned the backup - BACKUP 
mantra into my mind. Also realized how fortunate 
I was with not one floppy failing when needed. 
And we all remember how notoriously unreliable 
floppies could be. I did use Sony and TDK 
floppies and they were the best quality of the 
day.

If you can't backup or don't have access to 
serious and more expensive data recovery 
software. Don't erase (reformat) your drive 
without using DiskWarrior. As many of us know it 
creates a new directory and doesn't attempt to 
fix the old one. It is marvelous software from 
Alsoft. <A HREF="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/">http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/</A> read 
the reviews on their site and directions for use.

Apologize about the &quot;memory lane&quot; backup story 
but got feeling melancholy. Must be the approach 
of fall.

And finally... Good Luck!
Rod

</I>&gt;<i>I have nothing against DiskWarrior or Techtool, 
</I>&gt;<i>but I would not use any of them on a failing 
</I>&gt;<i>disk until I had done recovery effort for data I 
</I>&gt;<i>don't have a backup for.
