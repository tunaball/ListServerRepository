Tom - in spite of what Jerry wrote - and who knows, at this stage - I  
would still consider RAM as a possible source of the problems.

In June, I replaced one of my 512 Mb RAM with a 1 Gb chip.  I had  
relatively few problems, but the occasional kernel panic or freeze or  
something made me aware that things were not right.
Eventually, I decided, after a few months, that it was probably  
system corruption that was the problem.
I reformatted the disk, re-installed 10.4, but I was having kernel  
panics even at this stage. I realised that it must be a fundamental  
issue.   Suddenly, I thought MAYBE IT IS THE RAM !
I just took out the 1Gb chip, and everything was perfect,  
immediately, and has been every since.

I since returned the 1Gb RAM to the vendor, and got myself a Seagate   
Momentum 100 GB 7200 rpm disk for the same price as an exchange.

Please let us know how you get on with this issue.

All the best, Trevor
