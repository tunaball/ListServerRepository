&gt;<i>Why? Your MacBook has hundreds of hardware components in it which could

From what I have read bad or incorrectly installed RAM is often the
problem with odd problems like the occasional kernal panics.

&gt;&gt;<i> Again, any easy way to test RAM? Would an Apple store have RAM test

</I>&gt;<i>the problem in a reasonable time, they should send you a new machine, and
</I>&gt;<i>you might have to threaten to start an &quot;apple sucks&quot; blog to get them to do

Thanks for the reply. I had posted the problem in Apple's Discussion
area but got no response.
