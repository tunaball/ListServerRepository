<PRE>I'm in the same place as you Rod. Last week I lost three hard drives.  
I have a UPS device but something happened - I have no idea what.  
BUT. I was not only backed up once but several times. However these  
days, I have the following things to add to your comments.

1, One backup copy is not enough. Sometimes the restore function  
crashes the backup copy (notoriously with error -36) and it's easy to  
lose a single backup.

2. Files are getting bigger and bigger. I'm at the point where 300GB  
drives are not big enough for my multimedia data and backup is taking  
the form of putting chunks of data in different places. (The all eggs  
in one basket principle comes to mind).

3. I have to remember that while my wife and I have separate desktop  
machines, we share a powerbook, and the number of times we tread on  
each other is a pain. In the latest catastrophe, we lost four days of  
her email. Still stings even if I got the rest back.

4. I find it helpful to have a printed checklist of file locations  
and backup strategies.

That's all. Now to plug everything in at once and see what happens.

</I>&gt;<i> completely replaced, formatted and devoid of *any* of my previous

</I>&gt;<i> remember how notoriously unreliable floppies could be. I did use  
</I>&gt;<i> Sony and TDK floppies and they were the best quality of the day.

</I>&gt;<i> If you can't backup or don't have access to serious and more  
</I>&gt;<i> expensive data recovery software. Don't erase (reformat) your drive  
</I>&gt;<i> without using DiskWarrior. As many of us know it creates a new  
</I>&gt;<i> directory and doesn't attempt to fix the old one. It is marvelous  
</I>&gt;<i> software from Alsoft. <A HREF="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/">http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/</A> read the

</I>&gt;<i> Apologize about the &quot;memory lane&quot; backup story but got feeling

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And finally... Good Luck!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have nothing against DiskWarrior or Techtool, but I would not  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use any of them on a failing disk until I had done recovery effort
