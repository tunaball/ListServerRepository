<PRE> From my Yahoo homepage, a Reuters Technology story that, together with  
iTunes Music store continuing sales, seems like good Apple news for me:  
Switching to Linux may impact the likelihood of Apple hardware sales  
(esp notebooks), or am I being hopelessly optimistic??

I have listed here the story's opening sentences, and a few statements  
for brevity. It won't be hard to track the full story (the URL looked  
like it would break into dozens of pieces had I copied it)


Microsoft Loses City of Munich Deal to Linux

Wed May 28,12:38 PM ET

By Hans Nagl

MUNICH (Reuters) - The city of Munich said on Wednesday it would switch  
14,000 computers from Microsoft's Windows operating system to rival  
Linux ( news -web sites ) in a deal estimated to be worth tens of  
millions of euros.

The decision is a blow to U.S. giant Microsoft, whose chief executive  
Steve Ballmer had personally campaigned for Microsoft's counter-offer  
to the city, based on Windows XP

Microsoft has created two funds to discount its products against the  
emerging Linux software, which is eating into its most profitable  
business.

&quot;This strategic decision makes Munich less dependent on one IT supplier  
and sets a trend toward more competition,&quot; Munich mayor Christian Ude  
said in a statement.

Analysts said Munich's decision to choose open source software, which  
means Linux, was a breakthrough.


&quot;It is one of the largest desktop migrations to Linux ever seen,&quot; said  
Gartner Dataquest analyst Nikos Drakos in London.

Linux suppliers welcomed the move by of one of Germany's largest  
cities, where many of the country's biggest corporations have their  
headquarters.

&quot;You can compare this to the fall of the Berlin Wall,&quot; said Richard  
Seibt, Chief Executive of Linux software provider Suse. Suse is bidding  
for the Linux contract together with International Business Machines  
Corp.
