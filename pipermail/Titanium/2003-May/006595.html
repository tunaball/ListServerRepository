I can't remember off the top of my head Sam, but one thing I think people
are missing.. Is that in the entertainment industry - nothing is released
'internationally' at the same time (with exception to X2, which IS being
released around the world at the same time, because of? You guessed it
pirated copies of the movie on the net!)

Movies (in theatre, VHS or DVD), music, tv shows, Super Bowl ads, games, the
consoles that play those games - I don't remember too many people crying
that the PS2 was released in Japan like 6+months before the rest of the
world, magazines, books... The list goes on and on. What about computers?
The newest Mac gear takes weeks longer to appear in Canada after rollout in
the US.. Some electronics never appears thanks to the CSA or UL
regulations.. What about pharmaceuticals? Many of those NEVER appear outside
the US.. Geez, maybe the rest of the world might die off since we can't
obtain the newest version of Viagra or Migraine killer!

This is going to shake out and we just need to chomp a few chill-pills.

There is no way Apple would purposely restrict a flow of revenue this robust
to just americans. The US isn't the biggest country in the world (population
or geographically), there's a heck of a lot more money to be made *outside*
the US - I am sure they're onto that!

Another 2 cents worth from your northerly brother.
