Wow, I'd say it was the biggest mistake they ever made. I guess there is no
in between, you either hate it or love it.

&gt;<i>  I hate to sound

Well, I must say I've had a much different experience which is why I'm
reluctant to put it on my Titanium which runs like a clock on OS 9.1.

&gt;<i>I've had everything from
</I>&gt;<i> web browsers to games &quot;unexpectedly quit&quot; on my Powerbook and it still
</I>&gt;<i> runs very smoothly.
</I>
This is my biggest problem. Even apps like TE quit for no reason and there
is no way to up the memory or trash a file to fix them......there are so
many millions of cryptically named files, I don't dare touch any of them!
So, I reboot. Constantly. And constantly have to fiddle with the screen
geometry on my eMac as it becomes more and more distorted every day. The
thing weighs a ton, so not easily brought back to the store.

&gt;<i>I can't recall my greatest uptime, because I shut
</I>&gt;<i> it down occasionally when I'm not using it to retain battery life, but
</I>&gt;<i> regardless, it's a great system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And I've used 8.1, 8.6 and 9 before this; they were pretty durable, but
</I>&gt;<i> not quite as much so as X is.
</I>
I still do the hardest and most serious work on OS 9, longest uptime is
about 1 year save for installs.
I guess X is a wash with many of us....and Apple can't afford to lose core
user base, if it is true that it is we who are the hardest on it.
