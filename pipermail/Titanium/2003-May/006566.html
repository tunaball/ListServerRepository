&gt;<i> Surely you can't be believing this!!! Apple doesn't want your money

</I>
You're still not getting it in US are you? Apple _does_ take our money, 
but don't deliver the same services to us outside US. That is what we 
are upset about. We are paying the same or more for any products or 
services delivered from Apple, but we are constantly on the lower end 
of what we receive. As David R stated we can't use iPhoto fully, 
neither Sherlock nor several of the functions supposedly offered on 
.Mac but we still have to pay the same 100 $ representing a 
considerable higher part of our monthly income when yours.

So I am not at all pleased with that you keep on doing polls and other 
off topic subjects on a list for the Tibook, specially about things the 
rest of us can't even use and moreover doing so without even stating in 
the subject that it is &quot;off topic&quot;

I appreciate your knowledge re Ti and reasonably connected subject, but 
could you please get your act together and stick to the subject for the 
list. You could perhaps also consider that some of your friends even in 
US in on a modem and have to download lots of email far from the 
subject and often not qoutet as short and correct as the netiquette 
requires.

Please air any frustration about this letter privately to me and not to 
the list. :-)
