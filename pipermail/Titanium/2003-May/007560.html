Hmmm, 'cheshirekat'. I think I'll take that handle and start using it as my
own.

Thanks!

&gt;<i> On Thu, May 22, 2003, Cyn <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">flanders1 at charter.net</A>, invoked powers within
</I>&gt;<i> the internet realm, to proclaim ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I too recently discovered my music addiction. I purchased a 30gig
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iPod and also enjoy listening to audio books. People laugh because I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either have the computer in my lap or some gadget attached to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I take the train in to work. Only a few people are on at the time I
</I>&gt;<i> usually hop on. Last week, there was a new guy - young, tall ... and
</I>&gt;<i> carrying a new iPod. He'd been joining the ride for about a week. Only
</I>&gt;<i> other person on the train was a buddy from work who was much taller than
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;iPod kid&quot; sitting across from him.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My buddy and I had our coffee and were fairly perky. The &quot;iPod kid&quot; was
</I>&gt;<i> slovenly and oblivious to the noticeable lack of caffeine aura of his
</I>&gt;<i> profile. I guess he thought he could sail into the day by the wires of
</I>&gt;<i> his iPod and a song.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I leaned forward in my seat and said, &quot;Thanks for buying me a new
</I>&gt;<i> iPod.&quot; Then, while looking straight into the &quot;iPod kid's&quot; face, I said to
</I>&gt;<i> my co-worker, &quot;I bet I could take him and get myself an iPod.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The kid's eyes went from my face to my co-worker's, who only shrugged and
</I>&gt;<i> said matter-of-factly, &quot;Well, she is still on a 'been shopping at the
</I>&gt;<i> Music Store' high - little as she is, it could still be dangerous.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;And no witnesses.&quot; I added.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I couldn't believe how the kid just looked down at his iPod as if
</I>&gt;<i> considering whether it would be easier to just hand over his iPod without
</I>&gt;<i> a struggle. My buddy and I laughed hard. (I'm barely 5'1 and about as
</I>&gt;<i> tough-looking as an undernourished worm.) It was a short ride, but we
</I>&gt;<i> noticed how the &quot;iPod kid&quot; turned so he could keep his eyes on me for the
</I>&gt;<i> rest of the trip. I eyed his iPod the entire time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We all got off at the same station, and as we were walking into the same
</I>&gt;<i> building, with the &quot;iPod kid&quot; walking between my co-worker and I, my co-
</I>&gt;<i> worker said, &quot;You definitely could have taken him, but then, the iTunes
</I>&gt;<i> Store would get the rest of your grocery money.&quot; The kid found enough
</I>&gt;<i> energy to make a speedy beeline up the stairs. We were laughing even
</I>&gt;<i> harder as we got on the elevator. I haven't seen the iPod kid since then.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah. I can just picture myself on a &quot;Most Wanted&quot; poster. My PowerBook
</I>&gt;<i> would love an iPod little sister, but becoming an outlaw for a sleek
</I>&gt;<i> package of songs?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, maybe. It would be the dynamic duo of iTunes immersion.
