<PRE>Exactly one week after I moved up to a Ti Book 867 from my trustworthy iBook 600, my 4-yr old 
poured Coca Cola into the iBook. Ouch.

I was not at the house when this happened, but as far as my wife could explain it, she ran to the 
iBook, flipped it upside down to let it drip and then remembered I showed her how to open the 
keyboard. She says there was not much leakage.

By the time I came back home, there was still some humidity over the airport card and the metal 
shield. The sleep light stays on continuously and the LED around the power cord plug does not 
light up unless I twist it a bit, so I am guessing my kid also knocked it off the table and 
something happened to the power supply.

The iBook was already destined to the parts bin since the LCD backlight cable had frayed and I 
could not afford the out-of warranty repair. With the power supply (and who knows what else?) 
busted I have no choice but to scavenge it for parts. The airport card and battery are good, I can 
keep them for my wifes replacement iBook, and the AC cord works on the Ti Book, so I am 
keeping that one at my office. I'll keep the rest for bailout parts in case somebody I know breaks 
his/her iBook.

Now, the one thing I don't know what to do is the hard disk. Is there any way I can convert the 
20GB hard disk into an external firewire drive? Or at least, will my Ti Book take a second drive? 
Also, how hard would it be to take that combo drive and put it on the lower end iBook, the one 
that sells with just a standard CD ROM drive?

Thanks,

Pedro Vera
