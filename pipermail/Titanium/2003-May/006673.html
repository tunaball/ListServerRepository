This is naive reductionism. It has been said that there are two types 
of people in the world: those who divide groups into two types of 
people and those who don't. ;)

It is extremely rare for governance to be anything but reactionary. 
Sad, but true that the reactions are usually ill considered and 
overbearing in their attempt to make up for lost time.

&gt;<i> The companies that hide behind the RIAA, and abuse the DMCA, deserve

Perhaps, but do two wrongs make a right here?

&gt;<i> if the users of Personal Computers wake up one day [in the 
</I>&gt;<i> not-too-distant future] to find their every movement restricted 
</I>&gt;<i> and/or, monitored, after siding with these lying 'whiners'...well

</I>
Maybe the stance of those who &quot;support the troops, but oppose the 
policies of the current US administration&quot; is analogous.

You CAN support the protection and preservation of intellectual 
property WITHOUT &quot;siding with these lying 'whiners'&quot; as you put it. 
THAT'S what we should be working toward --a solution; not winking at 
theft and calling it a justifiable punitive action.
