Frankly, I think that this is a very important topic for Powerbook and
computer users of all stripes and is very on-topic. I'm sure we could do
without the profanity on-list though. (Off-list fire away , I'm an old
Marine and there's &quot;nothing&quot; you could say or call me that I haven't already
heard).  

How childish is that: You disagree with me (flipper) but I can't think of
any other comebacks so I'll just tell you to [expletive deleted] and leave
the list. After you (flipper) started the argument in the first place.

&gt;<i> Rudeness is not pleasant. But I refuse to let a nimwit with an attitude

</I>
Now it's my turn to say &quot;Oh Please&quot;. No one is trying to control your
thinking. The argument is neither high minded nor theoretical (as you've
stated). I believe it's a very practical moral issue. (ok, maybe it is high
minded)

The very &quot;practical&quot; notion is that &quot;millions&quot; of people are downloading
music illegally and in clear violation of the property rights of the owners
of said music. And anytime someone calls it for what it is, they get jumped
on by the likes of you, who says face reality, it exists and the consumer is
in the drivers seat and the whining company's need to come up with some
scheme to get people to start paying for it again, preferably by reducing
the price to some point that people will finally feel guilty about stealing
something so cheap and resort to paying for it. This is an absurd notion and
undermines the property rights of the owners.

And It's the same tactics that the left uses to justify expropriation of
property rights. Don't take them away all at once, just undermine them
little by little by appealing to people's base instincts. Don't tell them
it's wrong, tell them &quot;hey it's free, it's easy, take what you want&quot;. Give
people something for nothing long enough and they will value nothing.

 So in my opinion it &quot;is&quot; &quot;typical socialist rhetoric&quot;. And you don't have
to be a card carrying commie to be duped into supporting their agenda. (so
your mother needn't worry - too much)

This is not the market working, it's the underworld.

Well the industry is responding. And they are doing it by using the law to
shut down the peer to peer networks where possible, prosecute violators and
institute an aggressive PR campaign - and in some cases (Apple iTunes), a
modified pricing policy. They are taking control of &quot;their&quot; property rights.

But again, the really sad part is that these &quot;millions&quot; of people don't
think they're doing anything wrong.

I say they are.

Maybe it will never go away completely but there should be a stigma attached
to it and folks need to know they may not get away with it.

It's not theory, it's morality. And morality is the most practical thing in
the world (mine anyway) because it governs your sense of life and virtually
every decision and action you make or take. How theoretical is that?

OBTW, tell flipper that I called the U of Chicago GSB and they said: no
refunds on MBAs.  :-)
