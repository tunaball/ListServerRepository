HUH! really? Why is that? I hate leaving technology to make decisions for
me.. I guess I am thinking in the back of my mind that iTunes could variably
choose whatever rate and end up pooching the encoding for whatever reason..
I know there may be no basis in fact for my paranoia - but I prefer to set
things as high as possible regardless of what pre-set numbers are provided.
I can easily often tell the difference between vinyl and CD audio quality..
Hearing an mp3 encoded too low just kills me.

I usually see &quot;dumb&quot; when I see a device that has an &quot;auto&quot; anything, but
you recommend it eh?

&gt;<i> Did you know that to rip audio from a CD you should be at 44.1 Khz?

</I>&gt;<i> Previously if you forced it to use 48, it would introduce an extra

</I>
Interesting.. I have yet to come across a healthy enough resource to set my
mind at ease in this area.. Thusly I had set everything to encode high,
high, high. HD's are cheap - space is not a consideration. But if I could
find the info to let me rip at ease without ever worrying aboot it - I would
do it.

What aboot Joint Stereo, VBR and Smart Encoding Adjustment? Don't even tell
me I should be using the &quot;filter freq below 1-Hz&quot; setting too!

Should I be switching to AAC yet?

What's your suggestion for bestest-highest quality-sure to never run into
any sound deficiency setting? With no consideration to HD real estate. I
know a bunch of this was shared recently here, but I have been uber-busy
with a big move and new career, I haven't been able to read all that comes
through the Ti InBox.

Thank you for the information Tarik.
