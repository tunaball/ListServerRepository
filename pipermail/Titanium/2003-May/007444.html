<PRE>Hi John,
I have a working hypothesis for you: if the memory isn't from the same 
manufacturer/batch, and you're having problems with it, you should send 
it back and get memory that is.

Here's why...
Last year I bought a DELL 530 Precision Workstation (I know, I know... 
but it's a Brute of a machine to do my 3D work on... and Max doesn't 
run on a Mac) and bought the memory from an East-Coast place. I 
specifically asked for all the memory (2Gigs of RAMBUS) from the same 
manufacturer, from the same batch. They moaned about the impossibility 
of this from a fulfillment/distribution stand point, blah blah blah, 
and sent me two sticks from from the same batch, and two miss-matched 
sticks. When I called, they said give it a try-if it didn't work, 
they'd make good on it.

For the next two weeks I routinely tortured all the RAM-I was working 
on a rather large architectural project and watched Max fill, unload, 
fill, unload-rinse and repeat ad nauseum, during a very intense period 
of rendering. When the memory filled up, oft-times it crashed. Hard, 
nasty crashes that brought the whole house down, corrupted files, the 
whole ball of wax.

I finally gave up, called the east coast place, sent it back. They sent 
me 4 new sticks-what I'd originally asked for - and I haven't had the 
problem since. It has been nearly a year now.

Send it back and ask for the same RAM from the same manufacturer (at 
least) and preferably the same batch. I'm telling ya...

Good luck,
John B. Crane
