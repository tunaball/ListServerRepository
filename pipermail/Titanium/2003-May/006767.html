</I>&gt;<i> Students Travel the World Using Digital Tech Frontier's Virtual
</I>&gt;<i> Reality Educational Tools
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Virtual Reality Lab Takes Students on Adventures While Teaching
</I>&gt;<i> Them How to Learn
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PHOENIX, April 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Leveraging its expertise in
</I>&gt;<i> creating immersive virtual reality environments for major
</I>&gt;<i> corporate clients including IBM, AT&amp;T and Disney, Digital Tech
</I>&gt;<i> Frontier has developed the Virtual Reality Development Lab
</I>&gt;<i> (VRDL), an educational tool that allows students to create
</I>&gt;<i> virtual reality environments that teach them subject matter, as
</I>&gt;<i> well as how to learn, plan and work in a group.  VRDL can be
</I>&gt;<i> integrated into any curriculum that encourages exploratory
</I>&gt;<i> research and active learning, and will be available at more than
</I>&gt;<i> 215 schools nationwide in the coming year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Kids today don't respond well to traditional, static, lecture-
</I>&gt;<i> style teaching.  By incorporating elements of gaming and 'cool'
</I>&gt;<i> technology into VRDL, we were able to create cutting-edge, high-
</I>&gt;<i> tech educational tools that are fun to use and provide skills
</I>&gt;<i> for lifelong learning,&quot; states DTF's CEO and Creative Director
</I>&gt;<i> Scott Jochim.  &quot;We also ensure that all our programs meet or
</I>&gt;<i> exceed the U.S. Department of Education's National Educational
</I>&gt;<i> Technology Plan goal of better educating and preparing students
</I>&gt;<i> to meet the demands of our increasingly high-tech society.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> VRDL provides students with the hardware, software and
</I>&gt;<i> instruction manuals they need to produce their own virtual tours
</I>&gt;<i> from brainstorming through planning to completion of the
</I>&gt;<i> project. The teacher serves as the project manager, helping
</I>&gt;<i> students develop subject guidelines, realistic goals and
</I>&gt;<i> timelines and enforcing their implementation.  Students plan the
</I>&gt;<i> project, research information, gather media and material,
</I>&gt;<i> photograph the key location for the panoramic environment and
</I>&gt;<i> create a virtual tour that incorporates what they've learned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> VRDL and its companion program, Educational Reality System
</I>&gt;<i> (ERS), are currently being used at schools throughout Arkansas
</I>&gt;<i> under a grant from the Arkansas Department of Education.
</I>&gt;<i> Describing the impact of these programs on students and
</I>&gt;<i> teachers, Wallie Shaw, consortium project director, explains
</I>&gt;<i> that, &quot;Not only were we able to better convey critical
</I>&gt;<i> information to students in an interactive and dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> environment, but we are now doing it in a manner that is more
</I>&gt;<i> pedagogically sound and entertaining for our students.
</I>&gt;<i> Preliminary results of attitudinal surveys administered to both
</I>&gt;<i> students and teachers reflected overwhelming support for use of
</I>&gt;<i> the new technology that DTF pioneered.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> VRDL projects can be customized to meet the instructional
</I>&gt;<i> objectives of a school's social studies, science, math, language
</I>&gt;<i> arts, history, humanities and technology curriculum, as well to
</I>&gt;<i> foster community involvement among students.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because VRDL is user-friendly and portable, students can shoot
</I>&gt;<i> photographs and assemble a tour anywhere.  The complete lab
</I>&gt;<i> weighs only 30 pounds and comes in a waterproof, custom-fit, 30&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> x 24&quot; x 20&quot; sturdy, easy-to-carry travel case.  The VRDL
</I>&gt;<i> incorporates all the equipment needed to capture 360 degree
</I>&gt;<i> ceiling to floor, wall-to-wall environmental realities -- a high-
</I>&gt;<i> resolution digital camera, a 360 degree rotator assembly, a
</I>&gt;<i> tripod, a leveling pod, a spherical lens and a flash media card.
</I>&gt;<i> The ready-to-use lab also includes a simple, straightforward
</I>&gt;<i> instruction manual that even a technology novice can follow and
</I>&gt;<i> an Apple PowerBook G4 loaded with all the software required to
</I>&gt;<i> produce and edit 360 degree environments, edit 360 degree
</I>&gt;<i> movies, create three-dimensional objects and incorporate virtual
</I>&gt;<i> reality head-tracking capability.  To provide a fully immersive,
</I>&gt;<i> virtual reality experience, the VRDL also contains a wide screen
</I>&gt;<i> head-mounted display, a head tracker and a gyro mouse and
</I>&gt;<i> wireless receiver.  Virtual tours can be viewed (in the virtual
</I>&gt;<i> reality format) on PCs, Macs, large screens and the web,
</I>&gt;<i> enabling teachers to incorporate the learning experience into
</I>&gt;<i> any type of classroom setting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As classrooms across the country and even around the world begin
</I>&gt;<i> to use VRDL, students and teachers will be able to use the
</I>&gt;<i> Internet to share their virtual tours with each other and open a
</I>&gt;<i> window on their world.  For example, a group of students in
</I>&gt;<i> rural Kansas could experience Kwanzaa and students across the
</I>&gt;<i> country could follow the building of a New York City skyscraper
</I>&gt;<i> and could learn about Native American rituals and culture.  What
</I>&gt;<i> seems ordinary to a Future Farmer of America -- the birth of a
</I>&gt;<i> lamb or pig or the harvesting of a crop -- would be a totally
</I>&gt;<i> new experience to a child in Chicago.  Someday, a virtual tour
</I>&gt;<i> could help a Palestinian child and an Israeli child learn about
</I>&gt;<i> each other's lives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Like Nelson Mandela, I believe that, 'Education is the most
</I>&gt;<i> powerful weapon which you can use to change the world,'&quot; says
</I>&gt;<i> Jochim.  We developed VRDL to give students and teachers an
</I>&gt;<i> educational tool that provides more than facts and figures; it
</I>&gt;<i> engages their minds, stimulates their creativity and teaches
</I>&gt;<i> them skills that will help them succeed throughout their lives.&quot;
