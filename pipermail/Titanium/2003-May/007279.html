I had a similar problem a couple of months ago. Unfortunately, I didn't 
have any setup time to play with it (the audience was already seated 
and waiting). But I did have a QuickTime backup which I was able to 
play through the projector. So it's not a hardware issue with the 
TiBook, but rather a Keynote/VRAM issue.

In my case, I have the TiBook 667 (Gigabit Ethernet), which was the 
last version before DVI and only had 16MB VRAM. I think if I had played 
with Keynote's Presentation preferences, I might have been able to make 
it work by not mirroring the presentation on the TiBook's display, or 
by having my speaker's notes on the TiBook and the slides on the 
projector.

There was a Knowledge Base article on this:
