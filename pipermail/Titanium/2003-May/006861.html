Funny, but I've never had someone hold a gun to my head and &quot;force&quot; me 
to buy music.

You don't *have* to buy anything. If you perceive value in the new 
offering, then you purchase it, if not, you don't and you stick with 
whatever you had before.

I have 7 different versions of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot; Was I *forced* 
to buy anyone of them? Nope, I did so out of my own free will and 
desire to get a better product than the one I had.

Some people don't seem to grasp that music isn't a right. If you like 
it, you buy it, if you don't you don't, very simple. Nobody *owes* you 
a blessed thing.

 &gt;&gt; Well I'd say the music industry has enough cash&lt;&lt;

And people who have less than you think that YOU have enough cash so 
why not start giving some away? Perhaps you can work 10 hours a week 
for free because you're so well off, what do you think?

The ludicrous rationalizations here are mind boggling.
