<PRE>I'll also go on record as saying I've successfully bought from Coast to
Coast, without any issues.

I do prefer Data Memory (datamem.com) when they are lower in price.

Both, according to my poor memory (pun not intended), have been residing in
my Ti for a long, long time.

</I>&gt;<i> Crucial now, but they used to sell the cheapest RAM available.

</I>&gt;<i> problems.  I have seen maybe one Crucial module fail, compared to
</I>&gt;<i> probably at least 50 or 100 no-name modules.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I can't say that you will certainly have problems with Coast to

</I>&gt;<i> an order of magnitude or two worse.  I prefer to pay a little more for
</I>&gt;<i> a better product than to suffer through endless problems that are
</I>&gt;<i> nearly impossible to trace.
