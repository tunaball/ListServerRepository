<PRE>OK, I'm going to give a STRONG recommendation AGAINST Coast to Coast 
Memory (aka 1-800-4-MEMORY).  Let me just say that their RAM is the 
really really cheap stuff, and their failure rate is fairly high.  
Trust me; it's worth paying a little extra dough to buy good RAM.  
Buying bad RAM can cause random crashes, directory corruption 
(sometimes necessitating reformatting your hard drive), it can prevent 
booting, or any of about three thousand other problems; bad RAM can 
literally cause ANY computer problem, and I should know: in my job as a 
repair technician, I've seen most of them.

Anyway, you might want to check out 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.crucial.com/library/quality_page1.asp">http://www.crucial.com/library/quality_page1.asp</A>&gt; where the whole 
quality thing is explained much more thoroughly than I will here.  I 
would say that I definitely recommend Crucial; our store only sells 
Crucial now, but they used to sell the cheapest RAM available.  
Sometimes we would get whole shipments of RAM that were bad and would 
have to be sent back.  We literally had to pay somebody to just sit at 
a small testing machine and test RAM for hours and hours.  I still see 
people bringing in computers that have this older RAM which is causing 
problems.  I have seen maybe one Crucial module fail, compared to 
probably at least 50 or 100 no-name modules.

Now I can't say that you will certainly have problems with Coast to 
Coast; I'm just saying that their quality control is probably at least 
an order of magnitude or two worse.  I prefer to pay a little more for 
a better product than to suffer through endless problems that are 
nearly impossible to trace.
