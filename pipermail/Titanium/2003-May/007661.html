<PRE>&gt;<i>I sincerly hope that their will be _no_ substantive comments about 
</I>&gt;<i>such articles on this list. I don't mind you sending a link but 
</I>&gt;<i>discussions about this belongs to other lists. If you do insist 
</I>&gt;<i>please mark [OT].
</I>
Okay, I sincerely do not mean to be an antagonist here -- and that is 
not always the case ;-)

I do appreciate the reminders about properly posting OT posts, etc. 
but for those of you who are get emotionally charged about it, and/or 
have slower connections and are frustrated by the waste of bandwidth, 
there is a powerbook list that is heavily moderated and, in fact, 
does not allow OT posts:
&lt;mailto:<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">powerlist-list-info at sparky.listmoms.net</A>&gt;
The subject &quot;Apple's Future&quot; would most likely have been rejected, as 
they have a list that specifically discusses that.

Many people subscribe to both lists; it was from a referral on that 
list that I discovered this one. While this list is, technically, 
moderated, in the 2-plus years I have been enjoying it, it is clear 
that the moderator is very light handed.

That freedom of expression that some complain about is what, IMHO, 
give this list personality.
- I appreciate being able to post OT technical questions to this list 
because their are many, many smart and experienced people here.

- This is the only list I subscribe to where I feel like I have a 
co-worker-type relationship with many of the folks here... because we 
have talked about our cars, our opinions, and our lifestyles (and 
sometimes even as they relate to our computers!).

- Yes, I get frustrated with improperly marked OT posts, though 
usually when I disagree with the content ;-)  I would not trade it 
however, because I do appreciate the information that folks like Tim 
direct me to, the humor of people like Loren, the knowledge of people 
like Kynan, Shawn, Trevor, et al.

- With several people on this list I have regular email exchanges 
off-list; this is not something that avails itself to the more 
sterile, focused-topic lists.

I truly hope none of you will leave this list (I still miss Flipper); 
but if the little hairs on the back of your neck stand up every time 
you see an OT post, then you may want to question whether the health 
risk is worth it ;-)

To grossly paraphrase the addage: &quot;If you want a good watch dog, you 
have to tolerate some unnecessary barking.&quot; Please keep reminding us 
about OT posts, but try to accept some of our &quot;unnecessary barkings&quot; 
to keep this list what it is.
