<PRE>I write a monthly tech column for my national psychological society's 
magazine.

Usually, I email my copy to the editor, but today I took advantage of 
being in the same building as my national HQ for another meeting, and 
decided to visit and attempt to log-on to the intranet and post my 
article from there.

I was shown the President's office where I completed the column, but 
needed to access the internet to accurately source some URLs I had 
referred to in my article.

I was introduced to the newly appointed IT co-ordinator who proceeded 
to tell me that it was hard enough to hook up Windows laptops to the 
society's intranet, much less a Mac laptop.

Perhaps I had a dial-up account I could use, he suggested, pointing to 
a spare RJ-11 jack sitting on the table.

I suggested we try to use the ethernet cable sitting nearby, whereby I 
got a small lecture on Netware, thin clients, special software, network 
settings, blah blah......

Nice, I suggested, but humour me, let's just connect the ethernet cord, 
and see what happens. I wanted him to stick around in case I needed 
some password.

He grabs the ethernet cable, and I point him to the jack at the 
Powerbook's rear, and he looks for a light to come on, probably 
suspecting that the 'book won't recognise the jack. Of course, he 
doesn't know the Powerbook is autosensing and being at the back of the 
Mac a light is pretty useless.

So we plug it in, I head to Network settings, change the connection 
mode from Airport to ethernet, we wait a moment, I hit &quot;apply, and up 
comes all the IP address, submask, and router info.

His eyebrows shoot up. &quot;Ya better check if you can get on the web&quot;. 
Safari fires up from the dock (&quot;jees, that's pretty neat!&quot;) and we are 
surfing.

I suggest we try and log on to the network itself, so we hit Command-K 
in the Finder, wait for a few moments, and yep, there they all are. we 
click on one of them, he enters a username and password in the SMB 
dialogue box and there are all the files.

To say this guy was blown away is an understatement. I get the usual 
defensive stance of &quot;not as much software for the Mac, hard to get 
support for the Mac, there are no Mac servers (which I quickly correct 
pointing out favourable Apple server software license terms), and he 
has no choice but to say thanks for the lesson....hey, anytime! I Ccd 
him my article (it was on backup strategies for PCs and Macs).

So now there is at least one more IT admin guy who knows a tad more 
about Macs than there was yesterday.
