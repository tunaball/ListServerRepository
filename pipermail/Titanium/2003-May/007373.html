Ray - I have read - as perhaps many others - your posting, but I have 
no idea what is happening to you!

&gt;<i>I've restarted my computer and every time now I start classic I get the same

I am not sure how I can help.
This is what I always try to do:

	define specifically the problem.

1. model and OS
2. Does the keyboard work under X (so that we know the keyboard is OK)
3. does the keyboard work under OS9 (so that we know OS9 is OK with 
the keyboard)

Are you saying that when Classic is launched, the keyboard no longer 
responds at all, either in X or Classic.  Or that it does not respond 
in Classic?

I always start Classic after X is running.  I think there are less 
issues (especially to do with copy and paste) that way.  When do you 
launch Classic ?

Your problem seems to be related to the Classic emulation (subject to 
confirmation from the above answers).

If I was you, I would re-install 10.2.6 from the Combo update.  When 
you then launch Classic, it should prompt you for permission to 
update the Classic environment.  This might (?) fix your problem.

If this does not, I would then re-install Classic, then re-install 
10.2.6 from the Combo update.

Now, it may also be the case that your problem is more deep-rooted 
than just a corrupted file or preference.  RAM or mnotherboard 
problems can manifest themselves in strange ways.

Did you run the Hardware test CD for your Ti?

I am assuming that you have done al the &quot;maintencance&quot; things: 
rebuilt the desktop in Classic, repaired permissions and privileges 
using Disk Utility 10.2, etc.

Has any of the above been of help ?
Please bear in mind that I am just a power-user, I am a scientist and 
engineer, but I have no Apple technical training....

regards,  Trevor
