I made an assumption that you were intelligent enough to understand the 
difference between &quot;buying cheaper and better&quot; and THEFT. I was in 
error. Rest assured I will never overestimate your intelligence again.

If you don't like the price of a product you are more than free to 
search out the best LEGAL alternative, be that used, bartered, or just 
bought for a great price. You do not however have the right to STEAL it 
simply because you think it's too expensive. That line of reasoning is 
simply baffling to me. And here I thought that Mac users were supposed 
to be more intelligent than their PC counterparts, yet what I'm reading 
here is rhetoric that I'd expect from a 12 year old using their 
parent's WinTel box.

What I'd like to know is if any of the people here that illegally 
download copyrighted music have ever created anything of substance 
themselves? Do you even understand what it means to create a piece of 
art that comes completely from your imagination? Then imagine you've 
created it, you put it up for sale, and people decide they'd rather 
steal it. Flabbergasting.
