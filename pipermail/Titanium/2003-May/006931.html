<PRE>Ok, I KNOW this is a question that gets asked all the time.  And I know 
the correct answer to it is &quot;buy if you need it now, wait if you don't 
need it - try to be happy with whatever your choice is.&quot;

So I just want a few opinions, and here is the choice I am faced with.

Our university has evidently negotiated a fairly decent price on the 
15&quot; Titaniums.  Even our computer store manager says this is most 
likely because Apple is looking to move them in anticipation of 
bringing out new models.

Our normal &quot;edu&quot; pricing on the 15&quot; Titanium, decked out with a gig of 
ram, the Superdrive, and Applecare, works out to be $3,008.  No idea 
what retail would be on that - presumably a few hundred dollars more.

This &quot;special&quot; pricing, for the same 15&quot; Titanium with a gig of ram, 
Superdrive, and Applecare, is $2288.  $720 cheaper than our normal 
pricing and some additional amount cheaper than retail.


Now this isn't me buying this, this is my employer, but I like to think 
I do my best to save my employer money.  So my question is, seeing as I 
have a TiBook 667 (no combo drive, just DVD, so its an early model) - 
should I go for this deal *now* - realizing it is probably much better 
pricing than we will get on whatever new model replaces the 15&quot; one?  
Or should I wait?

The 12&quot; model, btw, is a bit too small and I'd prefer more speed, 
memory, and cache.  The 17&quot; model is frankly too large and, even at our 
pricing, too expensive for my tastes - $3,500 to get it up to a gig of 
ram with Applecare.
