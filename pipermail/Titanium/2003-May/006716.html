<PRE>&gt;<i> This is typical socialist rhetoric...
</I>
I am as far from socialist and typical as you can get. It is the MARKET that
decides these things, not the owners of the properties in question.  See I
AM a capitalist.. I believe the market is the ultimate arbiter of price.  I
exercise my right NOT to buy from those that I feel are not sensitive to me
needs. So if you want my money you have to earn it. Perhaps you are
confusing capitalism and totalitarianism?

And the invective is not helpful in these discussions...  :)

&gt;<i>It's no different than if you copied a published hardcover book and
</I>&gt;<i>distributed it to your friends to read.
</I>
According to current Intellectual Property law it is VERY different!  IP law
is different in every situation and you do not  want to rely on it too much.
A ROM with the words &quot;Property of Apple Computer&quot; burned into it was
declared to be unprotected under IP law....  do the research.  So the
copyright holders need not run to the courts. The courts have failed
miserably in digital copyright protection.  The best protection has been in
showbiz, as I have said many times.  It will be interesting to see how it
all works out. There was recently a decision in a court case that said a
file sharing service was not necessarily a device to circumvent copyright
and the judge cited the Betamax case that said that a VCR is not necessarily
a copyright infringing device.  That led to the &quot;Fair Use&quot; doctrine that is
reasonable for consumers and producers alike. (IMO, Of course.. You might
think that I am a criminal fort taping Will and Grace so I can see it at the
time I am able to watch it.. But the courts say it is OK)  BTW there are
numerous rights in Music. Not all of which are even applicable to downloaded
music.. Look up &quot;mechanical rights&quot; and you will see what I mean.

My belief is that the producers have to come up with something that
consumers are comfortable with.  It is that way in EVERY market.  The
problem in digital media is that consumers can easily go around the
producers.  But I would much rather pay $! for a good track easily
downloaded than struggle to get a crummy track with the end cut off for
free.  So I have no problem with the price. And the albums are a great deal.

&gt;<i>Unlike socialism (communism,
</I>&gt;<i>fascism) where it's the state's way or the highway.
</I>
It is exactly the other way around.. In capitalism it is the consumers way
or the highway.  Businesses must be sensitive to their customers.  If you
look at Apple, they have teetered on the edge in the periods that they were
not sensitive to customers needs and desires.
