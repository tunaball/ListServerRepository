<PRE> So 10 years from now would you still pay top dollar
 for dark side of the moon as if it were just released?
 Don't you think the price should decrease with age?

Funny, but I've never had someone hold a gun to my head and &quot;force&quot; me 
to buy music.

You don't *have* to buy anything. If you perceive value in the new 
offering, then you purchase it, if not, you don't and you stick with 
whatever you had before.

I have 7 different versions of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot; Was I *forced* 
to buy anyone of them? Nope, I did so out of my own free will and 
desire to get a better product than the one I had.

Some people don't seem to grasp that music isn't a right. If you like 
it, you buy it, if you don't you don't, very simple. Nobody *owes* you 
a blessed thing.

 &gt;&gt; Well I'd say the music industry has enough cash&lt;&lt;

And people who have less than you think that YOU have enough cash so 
why not start giving some away? Perhaps you can work 10 hours a week 
for free because you're so well off, what do you think?

The ludicrous rationalizations here are mind boggling.
