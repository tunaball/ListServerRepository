No, but I think it would be _wise_ of them to inform their customers, 
to avoid unnecessary negative publicity.

They probably think Windows users in the U.S. have a greater potential 
of making money for them. But I don't think loosing even more market 
share outside of North America is in the interest of Apple. Question 
is, why did they say that Windows support would come in

I wonder how _you_ would have reacted if this music service had been 
introduced first in Japan or Europe, with Apple making no mention of 
when the U.S. would follow.

Lets not make to big a deal out of this. This will not turn me away 
from the Mac platform in any way. I will certainly continue to buy and 
use Macs. But, for other people, I know that localization is very 
important.

This is pretty off topic, and you don't seem to understand why 
non-american Apple customers feel ignored and put aside. Lets drop this 
here and now...
