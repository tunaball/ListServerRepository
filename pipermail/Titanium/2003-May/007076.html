Colin,

I misinterpreted you but it is also true that some have misinterpreted 
Apple MusicStore limitation as well and even refrained from updating to 
iTunes 4 because of living abroad, i.e. EU, basing that decision on the 
information that the service is only supported in the US. And this from 
people *having* US cards from the very beginning but with an overseas 
residence. The information that it is not your physical location (IP 
number of your computer) nor your citizenship taken into account made 
for MucisStore to have some additional customers who would have been 
otherwise lost because of lack or wrong information.

 From chat and or mailing lists on music stores, the rumors are that for 
album downloads there would be in the future more graphical and textual 
information included but for the time being those are just rumors. It 
is nonetheless true that the service is a newborn and it has time to 
grow and evolve. It is all record companies interest to allow Apple 
satisfy demands from customers of the MusicStore: it is currently their 
only hope for a source of profits from music download: I doubt they 
will say NO to choral demands of MusicStore customers.

Cheers

</PRE>
