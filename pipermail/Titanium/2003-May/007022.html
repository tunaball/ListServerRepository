<PRE>Are you gay?  Only queers do drama this well.

P.S.  I am gay, so I can use the  Q word.  Thanks.

&gt;<i> I thought I'd share with everyone what Mr. XXL (is that his waist 
</I>&gt;<i> size?) decided to share with me via personal email:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First there was this gem, written after Mr. XXL visited my web page...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The best writers often write from their life experience. I saw that 
</I>&gt;<i> you had
</I>&gt;<i> written some works for the screen. So try to integrate  your 
</I>&gt;<i> life-experience
</I>&gt;<i> with your art.. I suggest you develop and submit a screenplay for the 
</I>&gt;<i> next
</I>&gt;<i> installment of &quot;Jackass&quot;. Good luck..  I do appreciate the good laugh 
</I>&gt;<i> I had over it.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Smacks a little of jealousy to me. Perhaps the fact that I get to do 
</I>&gt;<i> what I love everyday, creating art and giving back to the World 
</I>&gt;<i> frustrates Mr. XXL, who is most obviously stuck in a life that he 
</I>&gt;<i> hates, and which hates him in return.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then I was able to chuckle over this nugget of wisdom:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;It is obvious to me that you know zero about IP law, because I DO 
</I>&gt;<i> know quite a bit
</I>&gt;<i> about it. I graduated from the top IP law school in the US and we had
</I>&gt;<i> professors who were counsel for ASCAP who talked extensively on the 
</I>&gt;<i> fact
</I>&gt;<i> that consumers who owned a work on LP and then bought that same work 
</I>&gt;<i> on CD
</I>&gt;<i> were in face paying again for rights that were vested in the first 
</I>&gt;<i> purchase.
</I>&gt;<i> And the record companies know this and love it.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of which is completely irrelevant to his original statement which 
</I>&gt;<i> told me that I was FORCED to purchase the CD after I bought the LP. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still waiting for Mr. Brainiac to tell me exactly how I was FORCED 
</I>&gt;<i> to buy something. But I suppose when you're as bitter as he is, you 
</I>&gt;<i> need to lash out at something, anything, that will make your life seem 
</I>&gt;<i> even a little less horrific and meaningless. I suggested both 
</I>&gt;<i> counseling and asking this unnamed &quot;top IP law school&quot; for a refund of 
</I>&gt;<i> tuition, because they had obviously failed in their mission to educate 
</I>&gt;<i> him.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But alas, we still weren't done... Mr. Brainless felt the need to toss 
</I>&gt;<i> in one last grade school level insult. Get ready... it's a dandy....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I hope you grow up some day.. What are you.. about 14?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wow! Are you as blown away as I am folks? We are obviously dealing 
</I>&gt;<i> with a master of the written invective here. I thought I was dealing 
</I>&gt;<i> with an amateur until he pulled the &quot;What are you 14?&quot; from out of 
</I>&gt;<i> nowhere. He completely blind-sided me and I have to admit that I was 
</I>&gt;<i> unprepared for the barb that he hurtled my way. Not since that day in 
</I>&gt;<i> 8th grade on the playground, when a 9th grader, John Malone, made fun 
</I>&gt;<i> of my shoes had I felt so naked, my emotions laid bare. I had 
</I>&gt;<i> attempted to retaliate by making a crack about John's shirt, but it 
</I>&gt;<i> fell miserably flat, and that was when John let me have it. He said, 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What are you? 14?&quot; It hit me like a ton of bricks because I was, in 
</I>&gt;<i> fact, 14. I'll never forget the emotional torment that I was subjected 
</I>&gt;<i> to, and I still carry around the scars today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So thank you Mr. XXL for opening those wounds long closed. You have 
</I>&gt;<i> brought me back to a place I'd never thought I'd have to revisit. The 
</I>&gt;<i> very nature of your immaturity, coupled with your deep seated feelings 
</I>&gt;<i> of insecurity have taken me back to a dark time in my life. I hope 
</I>&gt;<i> you're proud of yourself.
