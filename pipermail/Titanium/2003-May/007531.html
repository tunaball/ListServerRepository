Not meaning to pour salt in the wounds - so to speak, but don't all PB's
come with at least a built in CD burner these days? (since the 550/667 were
introduced anyway, with new ones a DVD burner?) I am only replying because
we've all had a funky experience or two - not to bash Ray.

Back in the day when burners were SCSI and cost $600 and tape or server
backups were the only other (VERY cost prohibitive) solutions - it was
difficult - but a 600MB CD takes all of what 15 minutes to burn?

I burn all of my files to CD for sending to the printer and another for
backup - so I have a handy multiple solution process in place. I too have
lost files (just once, knock on wood) - but ESPECIALLY if you are going to
run ANY disk utilities or repairs - you must consider a backup solution
first. 

A CaseLogic book that holds 100CD's is only about $20, a spindle of 100 CD's
less than $50 - it's just too easy to coordinate these days. I even make a
tested backup of my professional applications InstallCD's to keep elsewhere
or for those once in a millenium times where even those will choke. Call me
paranoid, but we're living and working in a digital era that is NEVER 100%
reliable.

I am buying a new house and I am very happy to see that current house
insurance plans are unlimited for software replacement coverage and over
$100,000 for hardware replacement with a minimal of expense. But that's a
different matter all together.

Good luck with
 your recovery Ray. If anyone can help, rest assured that you are among the
best in company on this list.
