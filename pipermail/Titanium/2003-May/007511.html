<PRE>Hi Joel,

I'm using the Brenthaven briefcase style for my 17&quot; 'Book, but they 
also have a backpack.
I looked at it, but decided it didn't look &quot;professional&quot; enough for 
the crowds I'm in front of, so went with the briefcase.

I love it, and it's _HUGE_. Put some underwear and a toothbrush in 
there and you could really disappear for a few days ;-). I carry my 
Monarch-sized Franklin Planner in it as well as my 17&quot;, and sometimes I 
carry my G3 as well (in place of the Franklin).

The Brenthaven's skin is durable, its shoulder pad amply padded and 
inner's amply pocketed.
The backpack looks even more so, with of course the added benefit of 
slipping it on your back and having both hands free for travel.

One more thing- the briefcase has an inner sleeve that the machine 
actually nests in, with a little handle. This inner sleeve is removable 
if you just need to go lite. I've not used it alone yet, but I liked 
the idea very much and I'm sure I'll use this feature sometimes.

Good Luck.
