<PRE>Flipper asked me to pass this message along to you all:

After I sent my terse reply to the other
fellow, I looked at my own reaction, and the question was, &quot;Do I need
this?&quot; and &quot;Do I need to engage in the sort of thing that allows me to
respond in this manner, with the same rudeness, etc?&quot;  And the answer
was 'no'. I can't/don't want to dictate how others evaluate people's
opinions, but I do have some say ion my own deportment, do you
understand? I'm sure you do.

Anyway, I am severely squeezed down here in Boca, i have more work on
the near horizon [thankfully, but of course it's a ton of work, so I'm
going from near-idle to overworked, in one fell swoop], I'm re-marrying
late this summer, moving, and all the usual things that we all must face
as time goes by.

I like to think that I can add to the discussions [even Off-topic] that
arise, but when i start taking myself so seriously that one person's
remarks can let me forget my own civility, and cause me to take myself
too seriously, well, a 'breather' is in order. I've gained so much
insight into issues with our platform, and been so informed regarding
other people's differing views, work, problems, etc, that I know I'll be
back. But, for now, I need to reassess my own behavior, and come back
with more maturity.

Being called a 'criminal' shouldn't have affected me. But, for a Vet
[Viet Nam] who also went to jail for anti-war activity, and considers
himself patriotic [but also vigilant where our rights and duties as good
citizens are concerned] I have had some problems with some of the
black-and-white attitudes that seem to dominate discussions on the List.
But those are MY problems, and I'll work them through.
