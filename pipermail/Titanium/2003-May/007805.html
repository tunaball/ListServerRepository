I had pre-ordered the iTrip last fall, and I now have it on my iPod20. My
opinion, I don't care for it. It unplugs too easily. I had to cut the holder
off with a Leatherman (the piece that is inserted into the FW port fit like
cludge). It now fits better with the plastic peice filed off, but the unit
still sits slightly askew. Once you synch a station, the unit pops up enough
out of socket, especially if you have a case on, to interrupt the FM signal.
*grrr* The signal itself is ~okay~, though. What I am saying is that the
iTrip is not one of those hands off works for you gizmos, you always have to
jack around with it. I still use the cassette adapter.
