Hey Dave, 

It is nice to know that the information is helpful to someone! Thank you!

I am also sorry to hear that you are having the same problems.  Kernal
panics can be highly frustrating.  The first question I would ask you is
what type of CPU you are using... I assume from the post that you are using
an OS X v. 10.2.4-6.

I want first, however, to suggest a quick check for your 2nd question
(unable to find valid OS 9 system into which you can reboot).  Before you
attempt to reinstall and/or reformat, the first thing you should do is to
open the OS 9 System Folder and make sure that the system is &quot;blessed&quot; (i.e.
The system 'suitcase' is present and has the smiling Mac OS face visible on
the front of it).  If the system suitcase is not there, do a finder search
and see if you can locate it - and if so, move it back into the OS 9 System
Folder.  It is quite a bit more likely that the suitcase is there, but is
miising the smiley face.  If so, you can re-bless it by moving it out of the
System folder and drop it somewhere else (the desktop should be adequate)
and then pick it back up and drop it back into the system folder.  It should
then be re-blessed and you should once again see the Mac OS Smiley face, and
you should now be able to boot into nine on start-up (if your hardware
allows you to) or start-up Classic.

If this does not change anything you should do two more things before moving
on to the reinstallation or reformatting:

1) attempt to either reboot into 9 or open classic *with extensions off* !

B) get your hands on a copy of DiskWarrior (v.2.1 or v.3.0 - which runs
native under X and was just officially released today!) and try to verify or
rebuild your hard drive's directory!

Then, if still unsuccessful, your looking at the reinstall option, but try
getting rid of the old OS 9 System Folder and only reinstalling 9 only,
first.

In order to be both more timely and less long-winded, I will send the second
part of this posting (re: your kernal panics) shortly...

I hope this is helpful in some way. Let me know what happens (either on or
off the list, whichever makes you most comfortable.

Respectfully,

ShrinkMan
