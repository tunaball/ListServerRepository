</I>
Because Microsoft continues towards offering a Mac-in-Windows 
platform and Windows is offered by a variety of manufacturers, 
assuring low prices which Apple just cannot match. Fr'instance, I 
read where Dell even coerces its suppliers to do their inventory 
stocking for them. That lowers Dell's costs and allows them to offer 
deals regularly and otherwise practice shrewd marketing.

&gt;<i>Could it be that the Mac is not a Mac anymore?
</I>
As long as the Mac maintains its quality lead, it will have a devoted 
following, especially since Steve Jobs brought some of the magic 
back. By innovation and exploring new vistas, Apple will always be 
the trend-setter and savvy Windows users appreciate Apple's forging 
into new avenues, like music. I'd bet that Microsoft is well into 
research and development of their own UNIX-based OS.

Finally, part of what makes the Mac so attractive to me is the 
caliber of its users and this list is a good example of the Macintosh 
charisma. Service. Quality. Users willing to share.  As long as these 
three constants remain, the Mac remains my computer of choice and I 
gladly pay extra for it.*

By week's end I will have my new 17&quot; PowerBook and some lucky 
Canadian will have my G4/400 with a year's (almost) AppleCare left on 
it, which is yet another great feature of Apple:

*&quot;The bitterness of poor quality lingers long after the sweetness of 
low price is forgotten!&quot;
