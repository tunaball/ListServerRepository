<PRE>I found it funny that no one was up for the challenge :)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, I'm up for a challenge, and I'd like to prove it to you

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, those of us who specialize in, and like to play with cracking 
</I>&gt;<i> computers are *NOT* hackers, nor does your box get &quot;hacked&quot;.  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hacking&quot; is writing software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Place a &quot;secret&quot; text file in your user directory someplace named 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;secret.txt&quot;, the contents of which only you know.  I don't want to 
</I>&gt;<i> know your user name (if the box has multiple users), nor where you put 
</I>&gt;<i> the file as long as it's in your user directory.  Put your Mac on a 
</I>&gt;<i> DSL or Cable modem with a static IP that won't change for 48 hours.  
</I>&gt;<i> Connect it directly to the modem with the firewall on, with web 
</I>&gt;<i> sharing (http port 80), remote login (SSH port 22), and FTP access 
</I>&gt;<i> (FTP control port 21 and data port 20, plus non-privileged ports 
</I>&gt;<i> 1024-65535) turned on.  Make certain Windows File Sharing and Personal 
</I>&gt;<i> File Sharing are turned off, along with all other services on the box 
</I>&gt;<i> except for the three mentioned above.  Email me the IP address of the 
</I>&gt;<i> machine along with a waiver that gives express consent to me and an 
</I>&gt;<i> undisclosed number my colleagues to attack the box.  We need the 
</I>&gt;<i> waiver to state an understanding on your part that this is not a 
</I>&gt;<i> criminal activity, that we may take root control of the target box 
</I>&gt;<i> over remote connection, and that we may modify some critical system 
</I>&gt;<i> utilities, including replacing the NetInfo database in the BSD 
</I>&gt;<i> subsystem in order to do so.  We'll also need written consent from 
</I>&gt;<i> your ISP giving us permission to attack an IP address on a subnet 
</I>&gt;<i> owned by them.  An email signed with your PGP key is sufficient for 
</I>&gt;<i> your written consent, the ISP will have to fax me their waiver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Give us a start time, and allow 48 hours continuous access to the box. 
</I>&gt;<i>  To prove we broke in, one of us will email you the contents of your 
</I>&gt;<i> secret text file before the 48 hour time period expires, with complete 
</I>&gt;<i> step by step documentation of how we broke in.  And we'll do it for 
</I>&gt;<i> fun.  We won't expect any big prize for breaking in.
