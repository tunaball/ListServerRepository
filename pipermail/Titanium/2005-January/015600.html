<PRE>Lisbeth, if you have access to another mac, restart yours in firewire 
mode (hold down T when booting). Then connect through firewire to the 
other mac. You should then be able to see your old mac - backup your 
files and reinstall the OS, or run diagnostics, or erase the disk and 
start again.

So now it happened. :-( My Tibook 400 can't find it's HD. At the first 
failing start up it showed the Apple and the rotating &quot;sun&quot; and 
restarted again after what seemed to be a Time Out and then did the 
same all over unsuccesfully. Now it will only show the Apple and look 
perfectly happy with that but without doing anything more and 
eventually I will of course turn it off.

  At the same time my occassionally failing CD/DVD unit decided to go 
totally wrong so I can't use the Hardware Test CD, the Pather Startup 
with DiskUtility&#160;nor the Reinstall CD.

  1) Have reset PRAM even if I didn't think it would to much difference.

  2) T-mode connection with an iBook, showed the T correctly on my 
screen but brought the iBook to a holt in its effort to locate (show) 
my HD. (The iBook only on a fresh battery and the moment - would that 
make any difference?)

  3) Thought I had a working System on my iPod, but either it isn't 
working, or I need a better instructions on what keys to use to get 
hold of it.

If I borrow a similar Mac and install a fresh system on an extern 
FireWire, am I likely to have better success or do I have to get hold 
of exactly the same model Tibook to even try? Would it be smarter to 
install such a HD directly in the Tibook?

4) I had to open the Tibook to remove the now stuck CD, and after that 
it will accept a CD again but will not take hold of it correctly and 
start spinning but instead ejects it. (This has been the occasional 
problem before and my &quot;famous&quot; finger pressure in the players centre 
have helped but not now. Have used external DVD-burner ever for reading 
lately.)

5) I am capable of swoping the CD/DVD if somebody suggest an 
instruction link and if I get hold of one cheap :-) (Can't get hold of 
my backup with the good links since the Laptop PC I'm using for 
emergency doesn't have FireWire)

Really appreciate any help. (And yes I'm also looking for a new or used 
PB within my economic reach available here in Sweden) :-)
