<PRE>Ok I'll explain in details
I got an email from a friend showing me some conversation I had using the
email of microsoft entourage 2004 and while using msn, exactly the same
conversation time stamped as I had them 3 days ago! In addition some picture
I just downloaded from my digital camera 3 days ago! These picture where
stored in a folder on my desktop, all my firewalls are running, except for
file sharing since I use 2 macs simultaneously, the mails were sent from my
laptop, the msn conversation were done on my laptop, and the picture were on
my other computer which is a desktop, the laptop runs osx 10.3.6 and the
desktop 10.3.7

The files are still with me in the same folder, but apparently they have
been copied by some one who hacked into the system, I am not on a network, I
use modem dial up to connect, I'm almost sure that the intruder was from
Copenhagen Denmark, I reside in Beirut Lebanon!

Well thanks anyone who can provide me with any help.

Regards 

Ray


&gt;&gt;<i> Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a way to track some hackers infiltration on my system? I m using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OSX 10.3.7
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some files have been stolen from my system and some open conversations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (email) tracked!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One other question, in the activity monitor the kernel task Kextd is running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at full capacity taking 60% of my cpu, how to fix that?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks a lot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ray

</I>&gt;<i> having owned macs since 1984, and being a bit of a techie repair guy myself,
</I>&gt;<i>  I am sorry to hear what happened, but rest assured, I really DOUBT that it
</I>&gt;<i> is a hack job.   It is possible to have inadvertently dumped valuable files by
</I>&gt;<i> accident, or to have misplaced them, or misfiled them.   You have to ask what
</I>&gt;<i> benefit would anyone have in hacking your computer since 95% of the hackers
</I>&gt;<i> are PC users.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't doubt that you lost files, and that you feel that someone did some
</I>&gt;<i> injustice to you, but let's all see if we can help you figure this out, since
</I>&gt;<i> it will be helpful   to all of us to   do our detective work together.
