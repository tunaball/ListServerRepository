I am still on 10.2.8, mainly for reasons of lack of time to upgrade (I 
normally pencil in 6-8 hours for a major OS upgrade as contingency that 
things may break), as my Ti is the machine where almost 99% of my work 
gets done, but perhaps there are other reasons I did not run out and 
buy it as soon as the clock on www.apple.com struck zero hour.

I recently had a long debate with a friend of mine about where Apple 
are, software wise. He thought they were doing a great job with respect 
to Panther; I had my doubts.

I can not complain about the hardware;  I think that they have done a 
good job on that front. The hardware is so usable it hurts. We like 
that.

On the subject of software though, I am not impressed with regards to 
its usability.

OK , the main reason I got back into Apple products after abandoning 
them for around 4 years was OS X. In those 4 years I became a UNIX 
&quot;nut&quot; and could see the benefits that UNIX could bring to the Mac OS, 
and went out and bought (and carried home in a black cab) a graphite 
iMac DV+ SE, my first mac since the 8600.

As I plugged the beauty in to the AC and the phone connection in my 
living room, my eyes lit up as went through the Apple &quot;Welcome&quot; wizard 
after installing OSX Public Beta.

However, in each and every release since 10.0.x I have been waiting for 
Apple to go back and read their own book on usability.

Most software doesn't just &quot;work&quot;, you have to learn to &quot;work&quot; with it, 
but while businessmen were wrestling with the computer operators who in 
turn wrestled with &quot;mini computers&quot;, Apple in the 1980's somehow got a 
reputation for building a Desktop Environment that just &quot;works&quot;, an 
&quot;insanely great&quot;  &quot;computer for the rest of us&quot;....

I want this back; at least in part.

Yes, UNIX does bring a level of complication (multi-user for starters)  
to a computer, just as Microsoft Windows 2000 brought it to the Intel 
platform, but this is not to say that Apple had to burn the entire book 
on usability.

I remember me and my Mac buddies laughing at explorer.exe, the clunky, 
ugly and slow &quot;disk browser&quot;, while we double clicked our Hard Drive 
icons in 21&quot; greyscale bliss...

I'm sorry to say that explorer.exe is actually now a pretty decent 
browser (although partly for its unilateral familiarity) while I spend 
3 minutes wrestling with Finder.app and watching beach balls trying to 
find the file that I want.

Any of you who work in software will know the scenario; If the app 
being demo'd to the client has an easy, nay &quot;intuitive&quot; GUI, that will 
usually sell the product over another, perhaps more capable but less 
usable one.

So, a big thumbs up to Apple for creating the iMac,Powerbook G4, Darwin 
project and OSX including Aqua, but a big thumbs down for not yet 
producing a Finder that &quot;just works&quot;.

But hey, maybe we should go easy on them, producing software that &quot;just 
works&quot; is just about the hardest thing I (and probably your friends at 
Carnegie Mellon) have ever  seen.
