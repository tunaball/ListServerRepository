<PRE>Andre

It sounds like the original DVD has a fault.

Simon

--- www.simonroyal.co.uk - The box said requires Windows 2000 or better, so 
I bought an Apple Mac. There are only 10 kinds of people in this world, 
those who understand binary and those who don't

I suspected the DVD reader to be faulty, so I took an external USB disk,
and copied the DVD image onto it.
Then I boot the PowerBook from the USB disk.
Installation starts up fine, but it gets stuck at virtually the same
place.  Now it gets to 12% of Installing the BSD Subsystem.

So, the DVD reader is not the problem.

Can it be the hard disk (both of them?) or maybe the DVD was mastered
incorrectly, so my image on the USB disk is also faulty.

Anything else it could be?

With the last number of attempts it has always stopped at the same
place.  It only once managed to get past the BSD Subsystem, but then it
got stuck at 11% of the next section.

Any ideas?

Thanks
Andre Truter
