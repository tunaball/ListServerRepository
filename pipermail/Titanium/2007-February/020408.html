<PRE>Andre,

I suspect that part of your problem may be due to the HD being
practically full.  The installer uses a fair amount of space in order to
perform the installation.  I don't know the total size of your HD, but I
would clear off enough files so that you have at least 10% available for
the installation (~ 5 GB might do it).

Unix-based operating systems, like OS X, can have problems when the HD
gets to within 10% of being full. So, once you do successfully get it
installed, free up enough space to get to this 10% number.

I suspected the DVD reader to be faulty, so I took an external USB disk,
and copied the DVD image onto it.
Then I boot the PowerBook from the USB disk.
Installation starts up fine, but it gets stuck at virtually the same
place.  Now it gets to 12% of Installing the BSD Subsystem.

So, the DVD reader is not the problem.

Can it be the hard disk (both of them?) or maybe the DVD was mastered
incorrectly, so my image on the USB disk is also faulty.

Anything else it could be?

With the last number of attempts it has always stopped at the same
place.  It only once managed to get past the BSD Subsystem, but then it
got stuck at 11% of the next section.

Any ideas?


</PRE>
