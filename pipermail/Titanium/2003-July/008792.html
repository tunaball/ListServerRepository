<PRE>&gt;<i> What model revision is yours? &#160;Because I haven't yet heard of a 2002 or
</I> &gt; later model that chips or bubbles, short of actually dinging the case
 &gt; up (which I have done).

I have owned 3 Ti's starting with a 500 and lasting to a 1 GHz.  The first 500 developed a cracked hinge and the screen had vertical lines.  The screen case began to separate on the edges and the CD ROM frame cracked.  Additionally there was paint wear on the hinges to the point where there was little or no paint on the hinges.  Apple repaired and fully restored the unit to new which I call the second Ti.  It's paint held up well and I sold it to a friend when I bought the 1 gig.  As of last week, the 500 paint still looks great.

The I gig is a screaming machine.  I sold it to an associate and purchased the 17 Ali.  The 1 gig did have a scrape on the hinge and the top dented fairly easily.  Once again Apple gratefully took care of the problem.  I agree that the paint job on later versions of the Ti seem more resilient.  If you are going to buy a Ti that is out of warranty and it looks to be in great shape chances are that it had no paint problem and should wear well.  I would still advise you to get an extended warranty if possible.

As far the 17?  It is a worthy progenitor of the wonderfully designed Ti.  I love this computer.  The design is as beautiful and there is absolutely NO PAINT anywhere on the computer (except for the keyboard).  It is not TOO BIG to carry around.  I do it every day and any concern I felt about it being clumsy to carry was completely forgotten.  The 17 is a remarkably balanced machine making it's size irrelevant.  Except for it's 17 inch screen.  lol
