<PRE>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
My 15&quot; TiBook sat for about 2 weeks in &quot;Sleep&quot; mode in my attache case and 
when I tried to use it (yesterday, how timely for this thread!) the battery 
was dead and presumably had been dead for a while.

I always travel with two batteries so I snapped in the other one and turned 
on the TiBook. It seemed to take a l-o-n-g time before I was looking a my 
normal screen (several minutes), but the date and time were just fine when 
it came up.

It's quote common for electronic gear made in the last several years to 
have a Lithium Ion battery soldered in to keep volatile information, but 
I've no idea what Apple uses.

You say, &quot;not stored for more than a few minutes&quot;. But the only was to do 
that is with a battery, or a really big capacitor. I'm assuming it's a 
battery, and if there is no drain (i.e., the machine is sleeping or off) 
the battery should be capable of keeping the CMOS alive for quite a while.

I have had the same experience after allowing a TiBook to &quot;sleep to death&quot;.  The next startup seems to take forever, but after that you should have normal startup times.  I didn't see any date/time problems after restarting.  But that is a good question...Do TiBooks have a small internal LiIon battery that could eventually go dead?
