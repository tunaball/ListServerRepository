<PRE>One other thing that I will note is that after the restore, just before 
I would see the grey apple logo screen on boot, I would see a quick 
flash of the folder with the question mark on it.  My guess was that it 
was the system looking for a bootable partition with the same &quot;ID&quot; or 
something as the old one, it couldn't find it, then it went to the 
first and only bootable partition available, the internal one.  I went 
into Startup Disk preferences, noted that the 10.2.6 partition was NOT 
actually selected, and selected it.  That solved this minor problem.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As you've already got one on the way, I'd appreciate it very much if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you would please let me know how you like the drive once it's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I installed my new 60GB drive on Tuesday, upgrading from the stock 
</I>&gt;<i> 30GB that I had in my 667 Ti DVI.  The old model was the MK3018GAS and 
</I>&gt;<i> the new one is the MK6021GAS which, as far as I am aware, are 
</I>&gt;<i> basically identical aside from the size.  Both have a 2MB buffer and 
</I>&gt;<i> operate at 4200RPM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This was my first laptop drive replacement ever, and I also attempted 
</I>&gt;<i> (successfully) to run the exact same system after the upgrade, without 
</I>&gt;<i> reinstalling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have an 80GB Firewire drive, so I set up a &gt;30GB partition, logged 
</I>&gt;<i> in as root, and used Bombich's Carbon Copy Cloner to sync a copy from 
</I>&gt;<i> the 30GB drive to the Firewire drive.  I rebooted off of the Firewire 
</I>&gt;<i> partition and unmounted the internal drive (and the other Firewire 
</I>&gt;<i> partitions) and did a bit of testing to make sure the copy was good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, I followed Apple's Knowledgebase article on swapping hard drives 
</I>&gt;<i> and had little difficulty, although I did it slowly and carefully, 
</I>&gt;<i> taking perhaps an hour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I booted the machine alone to check for hardware problems, and it came 
</I>&gt;<i> up fine, although with the blinking &quot;question mark folder&quot; since the 
</I>&gt;<i> internal 60GB hard drive was blank, as expected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I then booted again off of the Firewire backup, logged in as root, and 
</I>&gt;<i> used CCC to sync back from the Firewire drive to the internal drive, 
</I>&gt;<i> rebooted off of the laptop alone, and everything looked fine!  This 
</I>&gt;<i> was two days ago and I have yet to notice any problems or differences 
</I>&gt;<i> between the old and new systems, data-wise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I have noticed is a bit of a speedup.  The 30GB, with about 27GB 
</I>&gt;<i> usable after formatting, had about 24GB of data on it (13GB of which 
</I>&gt;<i> is my iTunes library).  Now, I have a 56GB drive with about 31GB free. 
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm not sure if it's the drive or the free space that is causing the 
</I>&gt;<i> speedup, but I would suspect the latter.  Most apps start in one or 
</I>&gt;<i> two bounces, and the login process is much faster as well.  It was 
</I>&gt;<i> previously a chore to have to logout and then log back in, or to 
</I>&gt;<i> reboot and log in, since my several login programs would take upwards 
</I>&gt;<i> of 10 to 15 seconds to settle.  Of course, Panther will make this less 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary :-D
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The machine has 768MB of RAM and again is a 667 DVI model.  Hope Eric 
</I>&gt;<i> and others find this info useful!
