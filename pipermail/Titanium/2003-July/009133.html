<PRE>Thanks Kynan for the advice.

I heard my internal fan kick in while working on my PB last night. At 
least that still works. Wouldn't the thermostat controlling the fan 
notice the &quot;extra&quot; heat and operate the fan more often?

&gt;<i>there is a rechargeable internal battery that stores the date and

I'll do this procedure. With no battery in the compartment, my PB has 
been taking nothing but AC juice since last Sunday night. :)

&gt;<i>Before you put in your other battery, check the contacts on the 
</I>&gt;<i>computer, and make sure they're clean.  Remove any debris from the 
</I>&gt;<i>battery bay.  You might also remove the keyboard and check the 
</I>&gt;<i>battery connector on the logic board and make sure that there's 
</I>&gt;<i>nothing abnormal there, such as burn marks.  If the burned part was 
</I>&gt;<i>just at the battery connector end, it was probably a piece of debris 
</I>&gt;<i>that got in there, and the battery is the only damaged part
</I>
I'll do this as well. Thanks again!

Leo
