&gt;<i>I haven't had any problems since, except when I installed OS 10.2.6 and 
</I>&gt;<i>got some bum advice from an Apple techie (also, HP's driver doesn't work 
</I>&gt;<i>as well as an earlier version worked on 10.1.5).
</I>
cbirds asks:

&quot;What was the 'bum' advice when you did 10.2.6? I'm fixing to install both 
systems on the Ti, with OS 10.2.6 on one partition. I'm starting with a 
clean slate, OS 9.2.1 and OS 10.2 with the combo updaters to get up to 
10.2.6 and wonder if I have to update firmware first?
Any info/procedural directions would be appreciated.
If figure if I mess it up I can always erase.&quot;

As mentioned previously, I was having problems with QuickTime vis-avis 10.1.5; and an Apple techie, who seemed to be unfamiliar with 10.1.5, advised me to install Jaguar as a way to remedy the problems.  He walked me through the installation, and told me to &quot;archive&quot; the software (e.g., to save bookmarks); whereas, another Apple techie later told me that I had been given bum advice, and that I should have clicked on &quot;upgrade&quot; instead.  As a result, I lost all of my bookmarks.

When I was having problems printing on an H-P LaserJet 2100TN, still another Apple techie walked me through getting the latest driver from H-P.  It is installed now, and there are still printing problems that need to be remedied.  I assume that H-P's latest driver may not be totally compatible with 10.2.6.

I hope this helps.

Also, Murray Kastner writes:

&quot;I am stymied. Since first using Safari, I have not been able to save web
pages with the pictures intact, at least not most of the time. I have
searched the Apple forums and have got as far as seeing that others have
experienced the same thing - the 'best' suggestion was to take a series 
of screen shots... &#160;I wonder if anyone else might have come across this?&quot;

While not addressing your issue per se, I have had problems dowloading photos using Safari, and have reported it to Apple.  If I want to download them, I simply switch to MS IE 5.2 and there are no problems.  In lots of areas, it seems that the &quot;bugs&quot; have not been worked out of Safari.  Thus, when problems crop up, I simply go to the top of the screen under &quot;Safari,&quot; and scroll down to &quot;Report Bugs to Apple,&quot; and do so.  Hopefully with the next release, many of these problems will be remedied.

Finally, John Griffin writes:

&quot;I found out early on that there are some pages that Safari will not save in
any format whatsoever. I tried to save several pages of bank transactions
that were mostly text, then logged out. When I went to view the pages, there
was nothing there; no text, no graphics, nothing!

&quot;I have come to the conclusion that I can never use Safari for anything other
than view pages on the web - lightweight stuff. To do anything more serious
such as financial transactions I have to use IE. There seems to be no other
choice - especially if you need a proper record to save for you files.&quot;

Regrettably John may be correct.  Thus, hopefully Apple has &quot;fixes&quot; before MS &quot;bails&quot; on Apple users of its IE.
