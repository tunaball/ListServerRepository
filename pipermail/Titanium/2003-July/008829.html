<PRE>The facts from the thread are;  (a) We love our TiBooks (b) whether we 
want to admit it or not, they are fragile and we were, IMO &quot;beta&quot; 
testers for this now defunct series (note; no more Titanium out of 
Cupertino). Yes, that is Apple's fault, but Apple isn't my Mommie, they 
are a going concern, a business and as such have a goal to make a 
profit, battle competition,  and keep stockholders happy. This is 
covered well in the great book  Apple the Naked Truth by Scott Kelby. 
That said here's my experience

My TiBook travels only a few miles a day in a padded CaseLogic case. I 
use the after market velvet like cloth between screen and keyboard. It 
is babied because I know from other users and my own experience, it has 
to be. I live with that fact. I applaud those who travel the world with 
their TiBooks,  but I'd dig up a late generation Pismo and put a new G4 
CPU in it for my Road Warrior.

After one year of my Ti DVI 800 MHz: My PROs are too numerous to list - 
in short I love the TIBook even with it's CONs which are; It is a nice 
little &quot;lap toaster&quot; especially running VPC.  It has been back to Apple 
Care for repairs twice.  First - the notorious hinge break - snapped 
off without notice. (And yes I knew how to carefully open the thing) 
also had the paint bubbling issue beginning on lower casing - To my 
delight  both hinges, lower case were replaced without hassle and to my 
satisfaction. It hasn't happened again I think better paint and better 
hinges?  Second incident came 2 months after the first, system wouldn't 
power on and needed a logic board replaced. It was a long wait for the 
the repair but seems to be fine now.

NOTE; I am an Apple devote,  I  STILL love my TiBook wouldn't trade it 
for my wife's Toshiba  (which is the same age, gets more abuse and has 
never seen a repair needed!) Why wouldn't I trade? 1) screen can't 
compare, 2) weight - her all in one weighs a ton 3) hate the track pad 
4) hate the keyboard 5) no slot loading CD 6) WiFi card hangs out the 
side 7) Windows and temperamental Windows pgms vs. OS X Jaguar and the 
ability to use OS 9  -  need I say more?

Great thread folks -
