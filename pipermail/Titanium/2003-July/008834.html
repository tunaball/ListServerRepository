<PRE>Chris,

Since you asked.

Warning:  &lt;RANT&gt; My original foray into buying an external DVD burner 
was a bad experience with Formac and their Devideon product. 
Sub-standard customer service, poor tech support and crummy business 
practises coupled with a less-than-ideal case design and poor 
Devideon software (version 2) had me return and get stung with a 
surprise 20% restocking fee. I dealt with them directly on purchase 
and had NOT been informed of their 20% restocking fee at time of 
order. Obviously, I don't believe anyone should use this company or 
their products! &lt;RANT OFF&gt;

On to happier purchases and personal suggestions.

There is good news and even better prices since I purchased my 
external DVD setup only 6 months ago.

I ended up buying a bare Pioneer DVD-105 drive from ESBuy 
<A HREF="http://www.esbuy.com/piondv4xdvdr.html">http://www.esbuy.com/piondv4xdvdr.html</A>  (looks like they are 
currently $157 with free shipping. Way less than I paid just a couple 
of months ago. Assorted curses.) And an excellent external case from 
FW Depot. 
<A HREF="http://fwdepot.com/thestore/product_info.php?products_id=307">http://fwdepot.com/thestore/product_info.php?products_id=307</A> They 
currently have them on special for $104.95 + shipping.

Whereas Formac is still charging $399 for their poorly designed 
External Pioneer drive and wannabe Devideon software. 
<A HREF="http://www.formac.com/p_bin/?cid=solutions_drives_devideon">http://www.formac.com/p_bin/?cid=solutions_drives_devideon</A>

Hmmm... Let's do the math. $137.05 in your hip.

Heck, if you want a package deal with software LaCie's external drive 
comes with their CaptyDVD software and Toast Lite for $295. 
<A HREF="http://www.smalldog.com/product/44492/atdealsearch/">http://www.smalldog.com/product/44492/atdealsearch/</A> I haven't used 
this software or drive so can't recommend. I have had good success 
with LaCie over the years.

I have no affiliation with any software/hardware company.

Obviously... my opinions are entirely my own.

Trust this helps.
