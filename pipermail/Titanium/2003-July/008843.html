<PRE>Brian Davis has written:

&quot;I think that I'm just going to wait
until the 15&quot; Albook arrives (soon I hope) and then make the decision.
One thing that I didn't consider is the placement of the antenna on the
Tibook. I'll be using the new Powerbook in a wireless classroom setting
using video/image editing and flash animation software. I think that Airport
Extreme combined with the better antenna placement on the aluminum models is
making me lean in their direction.&quot;

Having gone through much the same thought process that you have, before I bought my Ti 800 in May of last year, I agree with you.  I would do the same thing, although none of us know when a new 15&quot; Al will be released.

Despite some of the comments on the list to the contrary, I believe my Ti 800 is &quot;rugged&quot; and terrific.  Of course, I never bang it around; I treat it with &quot;kid gloves&quot;; it is always in my Brenthaven padded bag when I move it around; and so far -- thank God -- I haven't spilled anything on it.

Any sense that it is &quot;flimsy&quot; at all must have applied to earlier versions of the Ti, because that certainly is not true of mine, and it is the 5th generation of PowerBooks that I have owned.  It is a solid machine and lives up to its billing.

Al's are the route to go though, because of their advancements, and the 15&quot; Al ought to be a gem, although realize that (1) it will probably be back-ordered when it is introduced, and (2) there are often some &quot;bugs&quot; in any first run.  Having said that, I am so satisfied with my Ti that I will probably be buying a 17&quot; Big Al down the road.

Whatever you do, Brian, you are not apt to go wrong.  Also, the iBooks and iMacs are supposed to be terrific too.
