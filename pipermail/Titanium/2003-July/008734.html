After nine months with a 667 DVI, the only reasons I'd want to upgrade 
are for more hard drive space (I have 30GB) and a SuperDrive (I have a 
Combo).   Other than that, just make sure you have a bunch of RAM and 
run with it.  I started with 256MB and upgraded to 768MB, and now I can 
keep 15-20 apps open at once and have instant access to them without 
having them swap to disk.  It runs great.  But those two reasons are 
the only big ones that have me actually looking at later models.  And 
no paint problems here on an April 2002 model that I got new in 
September.

The only reasons I'd wait for a new model are the aluminum enclosure, 
better screen protection, and Bluetooth built-in.  I agree that if the 
new ones are anything like the 12&quot;/17&quot;s, they will be more durable.  
I'm sure the &quot;frame&quot; of my TiBook is solid, but I treat the outside 
case like a baby to avoid scratches and nicks.  I have a Willow Design 
case and I love it.  The keyboard marks on the screen were an 
annoyance, but I got a leather pad from someplace that I put over the 
entire bottom part of the machine before I close it and those problems 
are gone.  And the Bluetooth &quot;nub&quot; that I use now is fine for my uses 
-- just would be one less step when syncing or using the Internet with 
my phone if it had BT built-in.
