</I>&gt;<i> I was in New Zealand and am just now back home. I saw a couple of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for Microsoft's desire to be more like Apple (creative, not the  
</I>&gt;<i> Dark Empire), I have insights into that aspect. It's opinion but  
</I>&gt;<i> why be constantly negative, like saying that bad things from the  
</I>&gt;<i> past mean MS will always be a bad guy. I myself am not known for  
</I>&gt;<i> taking the enemy approach to anything.
</I>There is some Microsoft product to be launched on 2nd March (http:// 
www.origamiproject.com/1/) And also the Microsoft Max Beta looks  
great. I mean that Microsoft is really getting out that times of  
Windows 95...
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for &quot;spinning off iPod&quot; I heartily deny saying this. The  
</I>&gt;<i> reporter asked some such question and I laughed it off as  
</I>&gt;<i> ludicrous. Why would Apple spin off something so successful. Then  
</I>&gt;<i> the reporter suggested that it could be like a separate division.  
</I>&gt;<i> Well, organizationally, it must be so already and I acknowledged  
</I>&gt;<i> the question I was asked in that way. Then the reporter asked if it  
</I>&gt;<i> made sense to have the iPod division somewhere else and I gave a  
</I>&gt;<i> mixed response, a logical response. I likened it to HP divisions  
</I>&gt;<i> when I worked at HP. There is a nice environmental effect in  
</I>&gt;<i> separate divisions. But then I mentioned that the HP divisions were  
</I>&gt;<i> making very different product lines, whereas the strength of the  
</I>&gt;<i> iPod came from treating a music device as a 'satellite' to a  
</I>&gt;<i> computer, and the intertwining of iTunes and the iPod made this  
</I>&gt;<i> possible. I did NOT say that the iPod division should be spun off  
</I>&gt;<i> and I feel used in that regard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Those journalists just turn everything round and round into  
somethings what you never said :))
&gt;<i> As for Intel, I have consistently backed that decision. But  
</I>&gt;<i> virtually every issue ever is not black or white. In this case the  
</I>&gt;<i> only thing I've ever said slightly negative, myself, is that I'd  
</I>&gt;<i> hoped for a new low power silicon technology that would extend for  
</I>&gt;<i> future generations, a'la IBM's copper technology back a ways. I  
</I>&gt;<i> said that I had hoped for more than just a good design to keep as  
</I>&gt;<i> much of the chip inactive as possible. The reporter again pushed me  
</I>&gt;<i> to say I was negative on the transition. That's a laugh, as anyone  
</I>&gt;<i> who is close to me can tell you, but I did acknowledge that some  
</I>&gt;<i> might be against it because of our 'big enemy' stance and so much  
</I>&gt;<i> of our Macintosh history riding on being different than the masses.  
</I>&gt;<i> That statement must have been stretched into being one about my own  
</I>&gt;<i> thinking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm extremely short of time, organizing things after a long trip  
</I>&gt;<i> (mostly email requests for my time) so if any of you can spread my  
</I>&gt;<i> comments around, all the better. The problem with thinking is that  
</I>&gt;<i> if you think out a 30 second explanation, it passes over the 5  
</I>&gt;<i> second sound-byte crowd.
