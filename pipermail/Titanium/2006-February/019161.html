In many cities the Verizon card gets 340 kbps, in others only about 125 bps.

The Verizon card driver was built into OS X 10.2.8 and beyond (I provided my own card to the engineers to get this done). But that driver only works with an older Verizon card. Apple has a newer driver coming out but it only works on a second generation Verizon card while the one you can currently buy in Verizon stores is a 3rd generation one.

I hear that a Verizon card for the new card slot of the MacBook is coming out as well, and that Apple will have drivers for it. I can't guarantee any of this. But the Verizon card is the most useful accessory I've ever had for my PowerBooks. In fact, I'm on a cruise ship using my Verizon card from my cabin right now.

One advantage of this card is that it is compatible with a new Verizon service, not deployed much yet, that provides 1.5 mbps. Another advantage is that this card gets it's power from the computer - you don't have to run your phone battery down.
