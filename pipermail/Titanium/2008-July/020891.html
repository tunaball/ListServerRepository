<PRE>Hi Guys:
My G4 PB TI 15 Inch 867Ghz, came with a W/a Software Install &amp; Restore  
Disk. It had OSX 10.2.3 &amp; OS 9.2.2. The next upgrade did not include  
OS 9.
I got it in 1998, the 11th month the DVD Rom failed, The Genus Bar  
replaced it and the OS X 10.3 was just released, which was installed  
by the G. Bar.
They did not install OS 9, therefor no Classic, I returned it and they  
had to install OS 9 first then reinstall OS X 10.3.
I am staying with OS X 10.4.11, because of my OS 9 Software.
Hope this info helps.
John

Thanks to all those who have offered help with this problem. I have  
been offline for some 32 hours due to an extensive power failure  
caused by a wild storm.

Here is the current situation:

The PB will not boot from an OS 9.0.4 retail disk - just gives the  
flashing ?.
Also will not boot from an OS 9.2.2 disk identified as a Power Mac G4  
install - same result.

I managed to find my old iMac software install and software restore  
disks, both of which have OS 9.1. The PB did get about 15% into a  
startup from the CD-ROM (and I thought I had it licked) then stopped  
with a system error type 11. So I tried again with the shift key down  
(no extensions) with the same result. This happens with both disks.  
That iMac i gave to one of my other sons, who lives about 400 km away  
so I can't just pop over and try the disks in that -- although it  
won't help with the PB anyway.

When I copied that iMac disk system folder to the PB and started  
Classic from it, an initial message said it was 9.1 and 9.2 is  
recommended. But it let me continue and then gave me the message that  
the system can only run on the original media and not when copied.  
That same message appears also if I copy the system folder from the OS  
9.0.4 and OS 9.2.2 disks. So although I should be able to just copy a  
system folder, it does not work on this PB.

So I seem to have reached a dead end on this one. Even if I did get to  
the original iMac and used it to update 9.1 to 9.2, then copied the  
system folder to try on the PB, the experience so far suggests it  
won't work.

Sigh ...

Don
