Complain to their developer, his/her supervisor, and who ever else 
controls the situaiton, and complain loud and often.  My ISP, Charter 
Communications, used to have a support site that would only work with 
IE on a PC.  Try to load the support site, and it would attempt to 
install some software - ActiveX stuff I suppose.  If you didn't have a 
&quot;compliant&quot; browser you'd get a message that your operating system or 
browser wasn't supported.  Ironic coming from a support website for an 
ISP.

I got a little miffed over it and called support just to complain about 
it.  The excuse was that &quot;most of our customers use Windows&quot;.  My reply 
was &quot;Well, you got some that don't.  What ya' do about it?&quot;  I think I 
called a dozen or more times in the span of six months or so.  They 
gave me a &quot;case number&quot; because I couldn't get the support site to work 
and couldn't access the settings for my personal webpage site.  Every 
time I called I gave them that case number and told them my issue still 
is not resolved.  Finally one day I got a tech who said they'd had so 
many complaints that they were changing the site.  And the guy I talked 
to actually used Mac OS X.  About two weeks later the Charter support 
site started working for me on both linux and Mac OS X, with any 
browser I wanted to use.
