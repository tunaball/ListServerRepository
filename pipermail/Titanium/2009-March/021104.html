<PRE>Hi

iBook G3s are the least reliable with almost all of them suffering from the 
graphics chip problem. iBook G4 still suffer from it but not as bad as the 
G3. The Clamshell iBook G3 are pretty reliable but are getting on a bit 
now.

&gt;<i>From experience I can vouch that PowerBooks are very reliable. I have had a 
</I>bout 7 without much trouble. A 1400cs, a G3 Wallstreet, 2x G3 Lombards, a 
G3 Pismo, a TiBook 400Mhz and a TiBook 867Mhz (my current machine).

None of them suffered from anything major or fatal. And they just seem to 
be better powered than the iBook range, probably because the PowerBooks 
were aimed at business users, they also seem to be built like tanks - and 
while some of mine have been a bit battered cosmetically, it has not 
stopped them working.

Simon

Hi Simon

That's an excellent story. My own tibook has certainly been very 
reliable and a real pleasure to work on. Nobody (particularly in the 
windoze world) would know to look at it that it is an ancient machine.

Which have you found are the worst apple laptops in terms of 
reliability? I read that the coloured clambooks had the least 
problems overall but they are really ancient machines now.

Marcus, I am looking at the quickertek wireless cards as a solution 
to the wireless problem on the tibook.
