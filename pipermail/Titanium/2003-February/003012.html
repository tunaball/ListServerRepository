Good suggestion John, with all that's been said this step seems to make the
most sense. As I sit at my desk the top of my crt monitor (2&quot; above the
viewable area) is just under eye level. I have it tilted slightly upward,
perfect.

The viewable area of the crt monitor starts 8 1/2&quot; up from the desk, where
the Ti display is virtually on the desk. This is where I disagree with 'the
formula' as it pertains to Kevin's (6'2&quot;) problem (and proper use of a
laptop, which is a personal pref). The stand I bought for my Ti raises the
'book to the point where the vertical centre of the LCD lines up with the
vertical centre of my crt display. Hits that 20&#186; sweet spot perfectly.

My Ti sitting flat on the desk makes me look down at an angle of almost 45&#186;.
Looking down 20&#186; from straight ahead moves my line of sight down about 6&quot; -
right over the top of the LCD.

That formula is talking about a computer monitor (which probably already has
a stand under it) - not a laptop lcd. How your Ti is sitting in the perfect
placement is relevant to your height and for many a laptop's height is way
too low.

If you are also 6'2&quot; then you must have one funky desk.
