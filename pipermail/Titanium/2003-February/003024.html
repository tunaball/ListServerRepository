He should first decide what size screen he prefers. If the 12&quot; screen is satisfactory, then I would have him benchmark a 800MHz iBook against the 12&quot; AlBook.

I can't tell a lot of difference between the two from the specs. The AlBook has Altivec, a slightly faster bus and better graphics processor. But they both run at about 800Mhz and most apps don't use Altivec, in which case the CPU performance would be pretty equivalent. He also probably has little need for a built-in Bluetooth. The dual display mode may be of interest.

But loaded with a sufficient 640MB of RAM, 40GB disk and Applecare, there is a $475 or so difference with tax between the two. That would buy a very nice carry bag, extra battery for air trips, and other little doodads. He'd have to decide if he can see enough of a difference in performance to justify that steep of a price jump.

Also, I haven't been following these things too close, but there could be an upgrade to the iBook line very soon that would further diminish the difference between the two.

Frankly, I'm not sure I see the significant market for the 12&quot; AlBook. The 15&quot; TiBook is definitely still the best of the lot.
