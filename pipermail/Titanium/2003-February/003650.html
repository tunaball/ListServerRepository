<PRE>According to Bill Reburn:

&gt;<i>Quark 5 has some good ideas there, but for me - at a time when OSX was
</I>&gt;<i>smacking everyone in the face I thought Quark 5 was a complete waste..
</I>&gt;<i>Little did I know that Quark REALLY would drag their feet this long.
</I>&gt;<i>Stability issue's aside - what did it improve for you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Doesn't matter to me now anyway though.. Since moving to ID, when I watch
</I>&gt;<i>anyone using Quark I laugh.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Whatever floats your boat eh?
</I>
Exactly. I have 'legacy' documents, that function as many-paged 
templates for periodicals. The basic design of these docs contain a 
minimum of 450+ 'baseline shifts', which ID, despite what it says, 
cannot import and display, properly. [actually, at all]. That alone 
keeps me from using it.

The stability issue is of paramount importance to me... BUT, I also 
keep a lean OS 9 [which i love, BTW], and part of its 'lean-ness' is 
an absence of internet-related apps. No fluff whatsoever. My thinking 
was: Why sacrifice drive real estate on my 
Internet/research/duplicated Adobe apps, etc?

But, in my work, under deadline, invariably I need to hit the Web for 
a better photo, get an updated ad-copy from a client, etc. And that 
means re-booting into OSX, for me. Big pain. But necessary, and at 
the worst possible times, too.

All of my favorite Photoshop plugs are OSX-only, which is another 
reason why, when I first booted InDesign [and InCopy] I thought it 
looked great. But the failure to import baseline shifts killed me. 
It's hardly a major problem, for someone who didn't need it, and 
would be a non-existent 'problem' if I were starting entirely new 
docs/publications.

As well, I would never use Quark to publish to the Web, nor would I 
use Adobe. Why? When there's Macromedia? If Macromedia took a run at 
Illustrator, I'd trash all of my Adobe apps except Photoshop. I can 
barely tolerate the Illustrator interface, yet, when an early 
'fanatic' for InDesign mentioned that &quot;If you like lllustrator's 
interface, InDesign will be an easy learning curve&quot;, STILL I looked 
into ID. &lt;Laughs&gt;

Quark 5.1 in OS 9.2.2 is not a 'perfect' app. Everyone else in the 
office, that I telecommute with, uses Quark 4 on G3s and PPCs. 
They're crashing all the time. But then, I use disk de-frag tools, 
and do other things, so the factors are too numerous and divergent to 
'really' do a side-by-side comparison.

Part of the deal with serious workflow software really IS 'whatever 
floats your boat' though. I'm used to Quark. I know what it can do. 
My documents took two weeks to put together, in Quark, at first, and 
today i can bang out 'better' versions of the same [page numbers, 
design-rich] docs in 8 hours.

If I take on more clients [which I am not likely to do, soon] I 
always tell myself &quot;Use InDesign for anything new&quot;. So, I'm not 
narrow-minded, but neither am I in a rush to 'fix' or abandon, a 
platform/app that has done so much for me... like support me 100%, 
for starters.  :=)

Happy InDesigning  :=)
