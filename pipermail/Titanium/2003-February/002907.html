&gt;<i>Dumb question. Does the battery have life as indicated by the led 
</I>&gt;<i>status on the battery?
</I>
Yeah, sort of a dumb question when you consider that I already said it 
won't power on at all...has not been used in a few months (I was in the 
hospital) but should work with the power supply....even though I knew the 
battery would have been long since discharged.

&gt;<i> If not, obvious would seem dead battery/bad 
</I>&gt;<i>power supply.
</I>
Battery is not charged....but is there another battery that can go dead? 
The power supply does not light up at the plug as it should or as I 
remember it should and as my trusty blue and orange iBooks do....

&gt;<i> If the battery has life and the power supply is known to 
</I>&gt;<i>work.
</I>
Neither.

&gt;<i>Try this. Hold down the power button for about 10 seconds. Make 
</I>&gt;<i>sure it is plugged in. I have had my Ti not want to start up/wake up. 
</I>&gt;<i>Had to hold power button down (like when it locks and won't shut off) 
</I>&gt;<i>to get it back on.
</I>
Tried that. Went through all the steps with the AppleCare &quot;tech&quot;.
I am going to see if I can limp into a store and test with another power 
supply, since I dont have another one similar that fits.

Also, this is OT, but where in HECK is the OS 9 that was supposed to come 
with the eMac/800/Superdrive? It will boot into 9 but I want this for a 
work machine and want X off completely because 20 out of 60 gigs of space 
is being wasted and I'm sure X has a lot to do with that. Can I just use 
my new 9.2.1 CD that I got? There is no CD with just 9 on it, only 
bundles. There must be some way to extract the installer from the disk 
images.
Then how to get iDVD back on there? Geesh.
