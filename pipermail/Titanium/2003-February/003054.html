<PRE>Glenn,

We own somewhat - completely different machines from the problem he is
having. Your 500 and my 550 have completely different cooling needs.

The 867/Ghz machines deployed some new fan layout that causes one or both
fans to be on a lot. Roald, visit some of the Mac forums (MacNN), many
people had problems that Apple has dealt with.. Some I think (not including
you in this statemnet) are too sensitive an have gotten no where.

Since I got my iCurve (not selling anything here Mr. Ameeti), my Ti runs
cooler in a very noticeable way. My regular use would have the 1st stage fan
on often (lightweight Quark, Illustrator work), with the 2nd stage kicking
in when I am really pushing it (prev. mentioned apps with Photoshop and now
InDesign plus browsers and email). After I dropped in the stand (right in
the middle of a huge project too), I noticed a large shift in the amount of
work I would get done before the 1st stage fan even came on! Before the
stand, I had days of working 6 hours+ with the 2nd stage fan buzzing away
uninterrupted. That 2nd stage fan comes on maybe 10-20% of the time now with
the exact same workload.

ANYWAY, as I mentioned the 867/Ghz machines actually have two fans in them -
of which I believe it is normal for one to be running almost all the time.
Considering you have TWICE the processor of Glenn and I - shouldn't be too
alarming.
