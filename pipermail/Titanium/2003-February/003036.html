One factor which has not received much attention in this discussion is 
that of the chair. I believe the type, positioning and adjustment of 
the seating arrangement is just as important as the height and location 
of the computer screen. I traced a condition of severe headaches after 
several hours of computer working to my chair arrangement. It can be 
very difficult to obtain the perfect chair configuration [if that is 
even possible!] and despite all the other factors of screen height, 
regular breaks and moving around, etc if the chair is not right for you 
when you are working you may accelerate the onset of physical problems. 
A good ergonomic adjustable chair is worth its weight in gold! [Even 
tho it may cost as much!]

There are alternatives also. One is a padded wooden knee-rest thing on 
which you kneel. This keeps your back straight as you work. Does have a 
couple disadvantages - if your knees are not good then it may be 
uncomfortable [altho the discomfort may force you to get up and move 
about a bit more regularly which could be a good thing] and some people 
may find it awkward to fit into.
Second, and this is what I now use and thoroughly recommend is the 
Swiss Ball. Balancing on this at your desk requires you to constantly 
microadjust your position which constantly exercises your whole 
lumbar/spine/thigh region. Takes a bit of getting used to a first when 
sitting and standing up but then I believe it is first rate.

And let us not get into the shoulder positioning - unnaturally pushed 
up because of chair arms or keyboard height, or naturally falling 
downward.

Just a thought. All this ergonomic stuff has been gone into by the 
typist generation. Remember them?!! Find yourself an experienced 
typist, probably now middleaged and retired, and they will have some 
pointers for you.

Just my 2c.

Cheers
