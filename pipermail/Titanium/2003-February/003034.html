Find out what scheduling software his firm uses and get a Mac program that is capable of interfacing the data.

Photoshop 7.0 for reading and manipulating art.

Final Draft Screenwriting software for OS X.

A portable firewire drive 120 gig.  Most Film Transfer houses can output a digital signal during transfer.  Even though he won't edit, working cuts can consume a lot of drive space.  With the firewire he can pull what he needs onto the hard disk.

Am not sure what you meant by Final Cut Pro tempting assistants.  FCP is not a true real time editor.  So it is quite slow and can get very frustrating if your on a schedule.  He'd hate it.

Set up for web tele-conferencing.  If he's a producing director he would love to know that he has that option.  That would mean software, camera and remote transmission capabilities.

A great set of headphones. Sennheiser, Bose or AKG, according to taste. 

I haven't seen the 17&quot;, but I wouldn't want to haul it around for very long.  It's big.  If he's got his act together there is no novelty for having the coolest computer.  Definitely go with the 15&quot; with 1 gig of ram and big hard drive 60 +.

Outside of that make the Ti bluetooth capable with new airport card.  And if he's got a phone/palm make sure he's got the Palm Desktop for OS X.

A Haliburton or Vanguard metal case for travel.  I know they may not be as cool as some slip bags but there is nothing worse then being bumped into at the Airport and dropping the slip bag with your Ti in it onto the marble floor.

Oh and tell him to get the 23&quot; Cinema Display HD for docking use, the price is killer and the unit functional.
