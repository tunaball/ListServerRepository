<PRE>According to Dave Morrison:

&gt;<i>I'm slowly coming to terms with my new PowerBook, but this thing called
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Disk Permissions&quot; has me baffled. What are they? Why do they keep getting
</I>&gt;<i>changed or broken? Why, after doing the &quot;Repair Disk Permissions&quot; in my Disk
</I>&gt;<i>Utility and &quot;locking&quot; it to &quot;prevent further changes&quot; do I find the
</I>&gt;<i>permissions changed again within a few days? Is this something I need to
</I>&gt;<i>worry about?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>dave
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>p.s. Flipper, thanks for the help on the inability to burn DVD's with my
</I>&gt;<i>external burner and iDVD
</I>
First, you're welcome, anytime,

As for the disk permissions. There's no getting around them. I'll 
fire mine up right now, in order to retrieve a 'copy' of the file 
that is ALWAYS in need of changing. It has been a few days, so i know 
it will be 'messed-up'. be right back...

Ah yes, here it is:
&gt;<i>Group differs on ./private/var/run/utmp, should be 0, group is 1
</I>&gt;<i>Owner and group corrected on ./private/var/run/utmp
</I>&gt;<i>Permissions corrected on ./private/var/run/utmp
</I>
Every time. The same blurb. I have to assume that the file/directory 
called 'utmp' must be re-written a lot, otherwise simple logic would 
dictate that it be 'locked', or, if third-party installers or web 
spyware, or Ashcroft is responsible, then, at least, it should only 
be written to by the 'super user', but noooooo.

And what's with this &quot;We&quot; are using new permissions??? For one thing, 
their [his/her?] version of 'new' is befuddling, and what's with the 
'We'? Is it the King of England speaking? I know royalty likes to 
refer to themselves [King or Queen] as 'We&quot;, or is it Nixon, again? 
Oh no, wait, he referred to himself in the third-person ['the 
President', instead of &quot;I&quot;, or &quot;Me&quot;].

At any rate, someone should tell 'them' that 'we' [meaning &quot;I&quot; or 
'us', or 'we' in the correct sense] have duly noted this change in 
permissions, innumerable times, and 'new' should be changed to 
'recently-altered', 'semi-old', or just left out, in the name of 
saving Quartz and CPU resources for the matters at hand.

Oh, and except for a reference to a 'locator' file, nothing, once 
again, was changed by Repair Disk Permissions, except the 'utmp' 
file. So, I'm [or 'we're'] good to go, for at least a reboot or two.
