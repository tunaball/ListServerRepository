I think this is a bit paranoid and I'd be willing to bet it will turn 
out to be unfounded.

Hrmmm - if you say so.  I've only ever been disappointed with VPC 
performance.

Dunno who these switchers in danger of switching back or not switching 
are.  I'm not one of them - that's for sure.  I have VPC 5.04 at work 
on my Dual 1.25 gig and only use it for convenience's sake - and hardly 
ever at that since Microsoft released the RDC for OS X.  I wouldn't 
dream of using VPC on my TiBook - too slow.  Sure - there are Windows 
programs I'm doing without at home or on the road - but they obviously 
aren't important or I would bite the bullet and use VPC.

A friend of mine is a fellow switcher - uses an older white iBook - 
maybe a 500.  He has a nice fast PC in his computer room he uses for 
games and some few things, but the bulk of his computing - email, 
iChat, web - is done on the iBook.

I don't know - I don't consider myself rabidly switched or anything, 
but my motto is &quot;if it doesn't run native in OS X I don't need it.&quot;
