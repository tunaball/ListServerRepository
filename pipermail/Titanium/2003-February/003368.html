<PRE>
Thanks to the groups for help with my earlier mails about problems with 
a tibook which woundnt work out of the box.

I took my old buggy tibook back to John Lewis ( a shop in London) who 
gave me a refund. The reason I didn&#8217;t do that straight away was that I 
needed a computer urgently- I put an order in for the new one at the 
same time as sending the other one back to apple, and was delivered the 
replacement 4 weeks later, just as I was billed for the earlier one, 
which the shop very kindly put on suspense, before giving me a refund 
when they got the first one shipped by apple.

I had very serious problems with apple support- over 30 incidents were 
logged in their db about the repair and return of the tibook. However 
it was all nicely resolved when they offered me a free full applecare 
plan- so I&#8217;m happy now.

I asked the list hether I should get the 12 inch book &#8211; and had a 
response (thanks, Mark Booth) that it doesn&#8217;t have the PCMCIA card 
slot. Very important for me, as I use a digital camera, so I stuck with 
the Tibook. Because I got the 2nd tibook after macworld, I saved &#163;300, 
so was able to get the extra memory as suggested by Yuta (Thankyou). 
the machine is great- better than I had hoped, and I'm loving Itunes 
and Imovie.

One OT query, and I can&#8217;t find an answer via any usual means &#8211; and I&#8217;m 
using OSX
My word docs &#8211; office for X are sent to my work&#8217;s windows address &#8211; 
when they arrive, outlook says that no application will open .doc.bin 
docs. This happens when I use apple Mail. If I send the same doc via 
entourage, the document gets compressed and then it is readable at the 
other end.

Now I switched to mac because I don&#8217;t like to use MS products, so don&#8217;t 
want to use entourage- is there any way mail can do the compression 
that entourage performs?

If not, I can stick with entourage but just for sending myself docs for 
further editing/distribution via windows &#8211; can I get word to associate 
the &#8220;send to&#8221; command with entourage rather than mail? If I can- then I 
can use entourage just for my WP mails to my office, and stick with 
Mail for all other correspondence.

Another thing &#8230;. Pdf downloads via safari always get opened in preview, 
even tho I told acrobat I wanted it to be my default pdf viewer &#8211; any 
way to fix that?

The only thing I&#8217;m not happy with is isync with the T68 phone &#8211; 
calendars only sync 8 weeks ahead (full calendar on an IR PC link), and 
you can&#8217;t put street addresses on the phone &#8211; hopefully apple will fix 
that soon. (and also the phone is not much good, but that&#8217;s not apple&#8217;s 
fault.)

Finally &#8211; I think it would be good to have one of those Dummies/Wizard 
books on OSX &#8211; is there any one which stands out- esp for a powerbook 
user- they all look much the same from a casual browse?

Thanks in advance for any pointers

Paul Watkins
