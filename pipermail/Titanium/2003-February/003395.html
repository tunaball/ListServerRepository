<PRE>According to David Remahl:

&gt;<i>If you don't want Apple to &quot;mess with your computer&quot; then why do you 
</I>&gt;<i>install their system updates?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Are the applications that contain the services stored in the 
</I>&gt;<i>/Applications directory or in ~/Applications? They must be in order 
</I>&gt;<i>to properly register their services. Services are stored inside of 
</I>&gt;<i>the applications, and only specialized applications are stored in 
</I>&gt;<i>*/Library/Services.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>/ Regards, David
</I>
Thanks for the suggestion David. But to answer your first question. 
As a paid member of the Mac community, I do not feel that there 
should be 'attrition' involved in updating the Operating System, 
besides financial costs. If I go out and install some oddball utility 
and the system goes haywire, well, that's my fault.. ha ha, I've been 
there enough. This just came as a shock, i guess.

I usually am quite happy with Apple updates, certainly with all of 
the OSX updates, so far. The Finder needs work, graphics handling 
needed work, things like GetFileType need work, etc. I have generally 
looked at Apple's updates in a far more favorable light than, say, 
Microsoft's [which have a notoriety due to their additions of bells 
and whistles, and ignorance of actual 'bug' fixes, until there's a 
scandalous 'security' issue].

I've had BBEdit 7, and other apps that are involved here, in my 
~/Applications folder all along. It seems that there is a 'block' on 
them now. perhaps I'll move BBEdit over to the root applications 
folder and see if it 'fixes' the situation, but I keep the apps 
outside of the 'Apple' application folder for a reason. My iApps are 
all still there, as are Cubase SX, Final Cut Pro, Boris FX, etc. [in 
other words 3rd-party 'big' apps that prefer being closer to the root 
directory].

The thing is, with me, 'Services' are really useful, and i use them 
all the time. Thanks for the idea regarding the 'other' Applications 
folder, that sounds like a winner.

&lt;fingers crossed&gt;
