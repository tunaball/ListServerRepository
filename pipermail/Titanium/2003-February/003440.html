<PRE>According to Michael Bigley:

&gt;&gt;<i>It's no federal case I'm making, it's simply aggravating, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>unnecessary, and increases, rather than decreases, my workload. You 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>know, I had pasta that was over-cooked once, too... didn't stop me 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>from eating Italian [I grew up in North beach] but it meant that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>when I break my own 'rule' and order thin pasta in a restaurant, i 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>always look the man or woman, taking the order, in the eye, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>make sure we 'understand each other' on the 'don't overcook deal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But isn't that analogy making my point of READING THE DOCS.  Several 
</I>&gt;<i>of the OS upgrades since the first release have contained specific 
</I>&gt;<i>information about the installation steps, which, if overlooked, can 
</I>&gt;<i>cause problems... isn't that the same as looking the waiter/waitress 
</I>&gt;<i>in the eye and making sure you are on the same page? ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>--

Sure, maybe, but where in the 'Warning' did it say that regular Cocoa 
and carbon apps, that have worked, been updated right along with OSX 
from the beginning, and have resided happily in ~/Applications, would 
all have to be moved to /Applications? And even then, the services 
aren't really 'all there'?

It was a vague warning. When they say it may not work with 
third-party system tweaking utilities,I had no idea they were talking 
about an app like BBEdit. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the 
Apple team didn't compile some of their own software in BBEdit along 
the way. When I read the disclaimer, for the fourth time or so, 
before running the installer through, I was thinking, jeez, i wonder 
if this is gonna muck up Tinker Tool? But an warhorse like BBEdit? 
That was rude.
