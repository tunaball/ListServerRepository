<PRE>According to Les Posen:

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Now, could we return to my original question??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Les
</I>
Sure  :=)  You need to import the material, change it, and export it, 
and that means software 'sampling'.

What you need is a simple pitch-shifter, that will stretch the time 
without changing pitch, meaning it takes 'longer' between beats, but 
the pitches remain true to the original,

or, conversely, change the pitch without changing the time, meaning 
to lower say, from &quot;C&quot; to Bb, but retain the 26-seconds time frame 
&lt;--i.e. to fit a commercial time slot

A sampler will do both, o in addition to countless other audio 
operations, and because OSX has CoreAudio, it is ideal for just this 
sort of thing.

There are a number available:

I use Peak 3.2 for OSX with a little VST plug-in called H-VST-Pitch 
Changer, but there is a pitch and tempo change facility built-in, 
also. The deal with Peak is that it favors working with stereo, 
mom,or dual mono tracks, and of course, anything in CD format. If one 
wanted to change mp3 files, you'd export the mp3 [from iTunes or any 
other mp3 'handler], as an AIFF file and import to Peak, do what you 
wanted to do, then re-import to iTunes, or whatever using AIFF to 
mp3, as an example.

I don't have Spark loaded on the Mac right now, but i'll look at it 
later. I do believe it handles pitch shifts nicely, and isn't 
expensive, either.

Also, any of the more full-fledged, non-linear sampler/editing apps 
[Reason, Native Instruments, Logic, Digital Performer] will do the 
same thing, but they need the file formatted in MIDI or AIFF, or some 
format other than the compressed mp3 file.

I accidentally erased your original message, so when you say you 
receive files that are too fast or slow, I'd need to know what format 
they're in? There are many apps to choose from, but I wouldn't 
suggest a huge investment in some app that has pitch shifting along 
with hundreds of other abilities. Changing to an AIFF file and using 
Peak, or Spark, is probably the way to go.

If there's a semi-serious budget, my sampler of choice is made by 
Native Instruments, and is called 'Kontakt'. It is terrific, but 
again, really loaded with features, and integrates to all the 
bigtime, pro audio apps that in turn integrate with DVD Studio Pro, 
Avid, Pro Tools, etc. But what an app  :=)

Hope that helps, if you want more info, ask, or try  <A HREF="http://www.macmusic.org/">http://www.macmusic.org/</A>

over and out,
