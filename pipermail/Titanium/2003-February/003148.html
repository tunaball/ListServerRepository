<PRE>::::::<i>DISCLAIMER:::::::::: 
</I>
I APOLOGIZE TO THE LIST FOR THIS EMAIL, IT WAS A RESPONSE TO FRANK'S POST
AND I WOULD'NT HAVE POSTED TO THE LIST IF I HAD FRANKS EMAIL 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<i> 
</I>

Frank, 


        I am glad that you can respond with such confidence to a admitted
younger person, i now look up to you. And you even said that you didn't
thoroughly check the compatibility issue :: 


&quot;I had no idea that there would be a compatability issue. Oh well, my 

fault. I'll use the DVD-RW with DVDSP anyway so no real harm there.&quot; 


second, &quot;my cheerleading&quot; was not done at your expense and I am insulted
that you would take it that way. I was merely pointing out a completely
bogus statement in hopes that you would come to your senses and not go to
windows. I also own a PC ( a dual 2.5 Ghz P4 for rendering purposes, not
cheap and not really wanted) sadly enough so i wasn't saying you aren't
eligible for &quot;the club&quot; as you put it. 


&quot;Do you use FCP? Let's see now, who are you?&quot; 


Yeah, i do use FCP thank you Mr. Frank Wiewandt. I have done quite a bit of
editing and producing with my High School's athletic department. I produced
the highlight DVD's for the football and basketball seasons, as well as my
varsity golf team, which i led to state. that is my experience with FCP and
DVD Studio Pro. I own and have used Avid and Premier. I originally applied
to Columbia college in Chicago because i wanted to be in the industry. After
a while, i decided to do Architectural Engineering as you so eloquently
pointed out in your nice, nice email. So my &quot;irrelevant commentary beyond my
expertise&quot; doesn't seem so beyond my knowledge, does it? 


        I already explained that i thought the compatibility was dumb, i
agreed with that all the way. I also think know that in the video industry
having ultra wide SCSI 10000 rpm drives is essential in non-linear editing,
so my remark about you not wanting to buy drives wasn't dumb and i am
surprised that you don't have extra drives due to this. It was a bit
inappropriate, i agree and i apologize, but that post was a outraged
response to the fact that a Ti owner could ponder going to wintel. So, Mr.
Frank, although i don't think i should have had to defend myself in this
fashion i have. I apologize once again that my post came across as an attack
on you, that was not the nature behind it. I hope we can move past this
incident as Mac people. 




Regards, 


Camron
