<PRE>Wow, I didn't think my post could possibly ellicit such debate!  This 
is probably a good subject to discuss.

I, for one, have had MANY physical issues since being on a computer for 
at least 6 hours per day over the last several years. The only thing 
that has helped alleviate some pretty severe neck, shoulder, and wrist 
strain (I actually have switched over to mousing with my left hand 
after carpal tunnel-like symptoms developed) is massage therapy, yoga, 
AND ergonomic training. My boss let me take some classes during the day 
and, after making even some minute changes to my desk space, a lot of 
my symptoms went away. Of course, one should always take breaks and 
there are all kinds of exercises one can do in between fervent work 
stints to help circulation and such. As for the info I have been given 
here's a quick rundown of what I received and what has been effective:

1. screen top at eye level
2. screen plane parallel to face
3. shoulders at rest, elbows at 90 degrees, forearms perpendicular to 
torso (straight out) and supported by arm rests
4. wrist flat, hand on even plane with forearms (palm is supported but 
not wrist as this is where your tendons are)
5. hand straight out from wrists (not bent to the side)
6. back straight and supported (good internal posture is essential, 
however)
7. feet flat on the floor with 90 bend in knees

other:
8. I have heard LCD displays are better on your eyes since there isn't 
the screen refresh issue nor the electromagnetic radiation
9. screen brightness should be roughly equivalent to the ambient light 
in your work space


Obviously, there's some give and take for each individual but I thought 
some may benefit from this information. I certainly have.
That's why I posted my original concerns about getting a laptop.

Thanks.
