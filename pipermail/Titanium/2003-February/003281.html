Hi Lisbeth,

As a former, long-time, musician, arranger, producer, and a veteran 
of late-70s Warner Bros, and a part-time recording engineer [both in 
pro studios and at several home-based studios], all i can say is, the 
material is 'balanced', or 'equalized' in the studio, usually for the 
best playback results on radio.

In addition, club mixes are engineered differently, and in the old 
days it was not uncommon to produce a version [intended for AM Radio] 
that was actually 'mixed' through a replica of dashboard-mounted 
speakers [in order to emulate/verify the adequacy of the reproduction 
in a car environment].

All that being said, the EQ controls that you have available to you 
are for you to adjust the artist's material so that it sounds best, 
to your ears, on your system. Any recording artist, writer, or 
producer would tell you the same thing. We/they all want your 
enjoyment of the music to come first. One must own an incredibly 
high-priced stereo system in order to get a truly 'accurate' [as the 
engineers intended] reproduction of the music at a 'flat', i.e. 
non-user-equalized, setting.

For most of us, a little audio balancing is in order. For instance, 
because my headphones do not press firmly against my ear, there is a 
'proximity' factor which comes into play, and as a result, the lows 
are not heard at the same 'balanced' level as the highs, SO, I adjust 
my low end to be boosted, for the songs being played back through the 
iPod, to compensate. If i were to not do so, then the result would be 
that I wasn't hearing the 'intended' version of the pieces. Ergo, 
mixing, or remixing the audio levels is actually mandatory, in order 
to have listening experience that is actually more faithful to the 
artist's original intentions.
