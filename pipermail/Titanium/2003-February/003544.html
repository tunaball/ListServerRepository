</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) What is the difference as long as it is PC133?
</I>
That may have been me, I usually suggest them. Technically the sell job is
that different manufacturers use different components to make up their ram
chips. Kingston uses 'better' materials and manufacturing than the rest. I
guess I consider them in some ways to be the Mac of the ram community. The
other places you list there are resellers, Kingston makes ram (plus a
million other excellent components).

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) What is the difference between Non-ECC &amp; ECC?
</I>
I do not know.. But the person selling you your ram should.. Would be
interesting to see who did know.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Has anyone had success buying RAM from 1-800-4Memory?
</I>
Yes, back in the day when all ram was super cheap (2001). I bought a couple
gig's - not a bad chip out of 4 x 512's. I have heard mixed reviews of their
service, I purchased online - never spoke to a single person.

&gt;&gt;<i> 4) What difference does it make if I buy 2 x 512MB or one 1GB?
</I>
As in a 1GB chip? It won't fit in your Ti, plus I don't think Mac's
recognize them either. I am sure someone has tried.. Maybe they do, but just
not supported(?) You'll have to buy two 512's for your Ti and buying two
usually doesn't save you anything either.

&gt;&gt;<i> 5) If I want to rack my powerbook with 1 GB does it have to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> low-profile RAM?
</I>
If you buy 1GB of ram from anyone - they may sell it as a kit for the Ti. Be
careful though - I remember some vendors charging more for the kit than
purchasing two chips seperately. I don't know why, it was one of the vendors
off Ramseeker though. Different models have different requirements - best
place for you to look is either on the Apple site in the Spec's section.. Or
look in your manual before trusting some website salesperson.

&gt;&gt;<i> Good Lord, it shouldn't be this confounding?!
</I>
Just like everything - buyer beware. If you are not sure of the credibility
of a company, go for one you can be sure of. I know that a web presence is
no indicator of business success - but by the looks of some vendors' sites,
I have to wonder...

&gt;&gt;<i> I appreciate any advice/experience you all may be able to offer.
</I>
One thing you can be sure of is that everyone here has bought ram, so I am
interested to see what personal choices ppl have made.

Goodluck.
