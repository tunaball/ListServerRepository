<PRE>Well Camron,

My post was somewhat based on an emotional reaction to a situation that I, quite
honestly, think is indicative of backward movement rather than a advancement in
the computer industry.

&gt;<i> i am sorry to say but if you are actually thinking of
</I>&gt;<i> going to windows then you are on the wrong list.
</I>
I own a PC as well as a  Mac. Does that make me ineligible for membership in
the &quot;club&quot;?

&gt;<i>  FCP is the absolute
</I>&gt;<i> best video editing software around.  it is used worldwide and in major
</I>&gt;<i> editing studios.  Why on earth would you want to go to a wintel
</I>&gt;<i> computer running avid?!
</I>
Do you use FCP? Let's see now, who are you?

As of 11/07/02:

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm Camron Flanders, I attend the University of Kansas.  I am 18 years
</I>old, and I am in the Architectural Engineering program so I use the
'book to do computer animations and CAD renderings alot.  I run VPC
when I have to access AutoCAD drawings given to me by my classmates.
(EWWW, II can't stand looking at 2000 pro in a window on my pretty aqua
interface). &lt;&lt;&lt;

I'm a professional still/video photographer who has was in this business before
anyone had even coined the word &quot;videographer&quot;. Your opinions on the subject of
NLEs are worth less than the bandwidth you use posting irrelevant commentary
beyond your expertise.

I was impressed with FCP enough to have invested in a Mac strictly to use it. I
could have put my money on FCP, Avid, Media 100, VV, Premier, etc. if
I really wanted to. I chose FCP. I chose a Mac. Does that mean I have to put up
with a lack of support for it?

&gt;<i>  If you are a movie editor and buying some
</I>&gt;<i> extra hard disks just isnt worth it to you then you may be in the wrong
</I>&gt;<i> field.
</I>
That's big of you. Again, who are you to make such a comment?

&gt;<i>  yes, i agree that the compatablity issue is dumb,
</I>
That was my message.

&gt;<i> but then
</I>&gt;<i> again, you didnt check before &quot;throwing money at that machine&quot; so isnt
</I>&gt;<i> it partly your fault?
</I>
Actually the drive in my TiG4 is listed as supported. It was only after I had
problems that I dug into the Dantz &amp; Apple forums to find that there is a
firmware issue. This is what I'm unhappy about.

You've taken my comment about &quot;throwing money at that machine&quot; out of context. I
said that in response to the suggestion that I purchase extra disk drives to
backup my system. While this is certainly a viable option, it is considerable
more expensive than Retrospect Express &amp; a stack of CD-RWs.

&gt;<i>  i hope that you can resolve this issue and never
</I>&gt;<i> think about &quot;reverse switching&quot; again.
</I>
It's not really up to me to &quot;resolve this issue&quot;. This is a known issue that
affects a lot of folks, not just me. I think it's a shame that neither Apple or
Dantz seem concerned by issues like this. In this case, slogans like &quot;It just
works&quot;, well, don't.

Two things before I end this post.

First, I really like my TiG4. I think FCP is the NLE of choice. I just want them
to live up to their reputations. I did not make this a Mac/PC issue. It is
plainly, in this case, a Mac/Dantz issue.

Second, I haven't enjoyed writing this post. I thought the tone of your post was
condescending &amp; I really don't appreciate it. You added nothing to the
conversation beyond an attitude. Your cheerleading was aparently to be done at
my expense.

Grow up,

Frank Wiewandt
