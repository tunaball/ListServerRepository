Frank - I feel pretty disappointed to read about this backup issue 
that you encountered.

I also saw that this thread got quite &quot;hot&quot; !   The heat brought out 
some interesting points and information, and I hope that some 
forgiveness has been spread around, as part of the cooling process.

Al I want to do is add my &#162;2 ....

I have now been using Retrospect backup for my Mac for 12+ years.  I 
incrementally backup my entire partitioned hard disk (40Gb) on my 
Ti-500 every day to an external 40 Gb USB drive.  I am very happy 
with this softwware/hardware combination.  I have a Retrospect script 
that does everything automatically, with one cursor movement per day.

I have found Dantz to be a very Mac-oriented company.  It is true 
that from time to time, Dantz have dropped the ball, and not kept up 
to date with latest OS release, or have been late with external drive 
recognition (or in your case are never going to accommodate your 
drive), but over the long-term, they have done a good job.  I do not 
condone all of their behaviour (especially the situation that Woz 
reported).  There is always room for improvement.

However, I still maintain that everyone with a Ti should have a 
current backup, and I know of no better software for that than 
Restrospect.

regards,  Trevor
