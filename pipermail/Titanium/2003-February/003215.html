<PRE>I just recently went through a power supply &quot;hell&quot; of sorts. My 
sister's brick for her iceBook developed a short at the plug head. The 
insulation had deteriorated and the wires were frayed. She called in 
for a new one under apple care. In the time that waited for it, her 
husband got a new Ai 12&quot;, and a day or 2 after that her completely 
died. So she had to begin sharing with her husband for juice.  In this 
time my own adaptor (hockey puck) had developed a short (it shorted 
where it stresses coming out of the puck. Where it gets bent when you 
wrap it up). I had taken the puck apart (which when you do, it doesn't 
go back together) and repaired the short. The next day my brother in 
law accidentally kicked the wire and busted the wire at the plug head. 
So now there where 3 of us on adaptor. I went to the store and got a 
new brick adaptor for my Ti, which works fine. My sister had been 
waiting for about 2 weeks for a new adaptor, in that time apple sent 
her, first an adaptor for an AirPort, then a hockey puck. They finally 
sent, day before, the right adaptor, and sent 2. go figure. All in all 
the brick works fine on the Ti... I suggest if you have an opportunity 
to get a brick in place of the puck, do it as the puck will fail.
