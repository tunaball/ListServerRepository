<PRE>According to cbirds:

&gt;<i>Has anyone on ELN had Ti list messages bounce? I assume this was a
</I>&gt;<i>problem with Earthlink servers so I notified them to please see what was
</I>&gt;<i>going on else all my lists would be unsubbed.
</I>&gt;<i>I think tech support, everywhere, has hit rock bottom, either that or no
</I>&gt;<i>one can read. I simply told them that the list I was on had a message
</I>&gt;<i>rejected by ELN because apparently ELN was down. Pretty straightforward
</I>&gt;<i>eh?
</I>
In the Miami area we get our fair share of problems. My roommate's 
dsl with Earthlink goes down more often than mine, and we're both on 
separate Earthlink dsl accounts. He's a PC gamer, so you never know. 
he uses WinPoET, and I use MacPoET in OS 9, and built-in PPoE in OSX 
[where I usually work).

I have only had one bounced mail warning, related to my Earthlink 
email address, in many months, and that was last week, when the main 
Miami-area servers were being maintenanced. &lt;--(Not a 'real' word) It 
must have been a very brief outage, as my email is heavier than 
average. If you want to look at unstable servers, check out Yahoo, 
they go down all the time. maybe they're using NT &lt;Laughs&gt;. I used a 
paid-for yahoo address for several lists, and they became very 
problematic. A wave of bounced errors, and having to re-establish 
list subscriptions led me to abandon yahoo for any business or 
list-related activity.

None of the phone companies or large ISPs ever wants to accept 
responsibility for any service interruptions, at all. This is old 
news.
