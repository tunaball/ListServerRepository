Yes, because they are switching! My group went from a PC majority to a 
PC minority group. Long time Apple haters are more or less frantic now 
and more and more I hear people commenting their next PC replacement 
might well be a Mac. At conferences and workshops the Macs (Tibooks in 
majority) are no more a lonely appearance. They well are in greater 
number than many other laptops,
Friday at a plenary session I counted 14 TiBooks in the audience out of 
some 40 laptops around, That is an incredible figure and definitely was 
the single best represented brand in the amphitheater.

</I>&gt;<i> Just my opinion . :-)

Might be 70% but it is dropping at fast rate. On our lab there will be 
no more OS 9 running in an estimated 3 months: and there are 1436 
Macintosh running. The orders for TiBooks and iBooks and desktop are 
currently backlogged and that is the first time in some 5 years.

Must be your opinion certainly but you must be living in a niche 
environment or on such an extreme fringe of the distribution to be 
claiming such a thing. TiBook is the best selling (all brands) laptop 
since long time, Macs sell more then even before, the latest market 
rate is increasing and over 3%, more and more major sw producers are 
coming out with OS X product. Some late comers (Quark) finally came out 
with the OS X version.

The rate of Linux and Unix packages ported to OS X is increasing almost 
exponentially - which is an indication of the adoption of the platform 
from OpenSource developers.
Apple with Dell is the only profitable computer maker in this economy 
downturn.

cbird: no flame here, but crash-a-day? And you call that an opinion? 
That is utterly a false statement or else you are desperately trying to 
install a OS 9 extension believing it is a kext! ;-)
You may take that as a flame but - seriously now - if your OS X truly 
crashes once a day bring it to a repair shop: you must have a hardware 
failure somewhere: all the OS X users I know (and they are many!) have 
average uptime of double digits days. I personally never shut down my 
TiBook and reboot only when some updates/install here and there 
requires it . The last kernel panic I had I was running OS X 10.1.4.
One of my colleagues - who switched a couple of months ago is 
mesmerized he can leave the TiBook on sleep mode and never reboot for 
days: his experience - and he believed was a common and normal thing 
with computers - was to never let the PC sleep at night as in the 
morning everything would be frozen. He believed sleep in computers was 
a matter of a couple of hours at most then either wake it up or face a 
reboot next time you need it.

PS

The lab I am at the moment counts some 8000 people so it IS a decent 
indication of the general scientific and educational community. One 
experiment is even supporting the platform because of its stability. A 
crash-a-day OS? Such a unbelievable statement I have to believe you 
must be able to crash a typewriter machine.
