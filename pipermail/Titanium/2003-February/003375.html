<PRE>According to Murray E. Milligan:

&gt;<i>So to the question, How do I move plug ins, assuming that's the 
</I>&gt;<i>problem to a location so my Scanwise can &quot;see&quot; PS Elements and 
</I>&gt;<i>Readiris for OS X.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If we can take this off line that's fine, but I'm sure I'm not the 
</I>&gt;<i>only neophyte out there in the silicone ether who can learn from 
</I>&gt;<i>this experience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I thank you all for your time and thank you in advance for your replies.

</I>&gt;<i>Cheers to all.

Murray,

I don't use Scanwise, but I do use TWAIN [the importer of scanned 
images for all of my photo apps which include Photoshop and P--Shop 
Elements 2, etc].

I can't be 100% certain how it works w/Scanwise, but in the Photoshop 
Elements folder, you'll find a folder called 'Plugins' and inside of 
it you'll see quite a number of folders, one of which is called 
'Import/Export&quot;. My TWAIN plugin is located there, and works 
flawlessly. It's in the same folder in Photoshop 7, also.

I'm not running any photo apps in 9, but I know the TWAIN drivers 
were in the same places in the OS 9 versions of these same apps.

I'm curious as to whether or not Scanwise, when you ran the 
installer,  did it ask you to locate any particular folder? Sometimes 
the Installers for plug-ins will select a relevant, but incorrect 
location for an install. Example: When I recently installed Kai's 
Effects [a Photoshop, Elements, etc, plugin filter/effects suite], 
the installer 'defaulted' to my copy of IconBuilder Pro, a Photoshop 
plugin for Mac/Windows, that I hadn't even installed yet, so you 
never know. At the time I simply looked at the Installer, saw it was 
targeting the Icon builder, and used the button on the Installer to 
select a folder. Of course i selected the 'filters' folder in my 
Photoshop's 'Plug-ins' folder, and all was well.

You might try a re-install  of Scanwise, or, failing that, open the 
Scanwise folder and see if there aren't plugins just sitting in the 
folder.

Sometimes the plugins [and everything else in the app, are not 
readily visible, in which case Control-Click on the Application's 
icon and select 'Show Package Contents'. From there you open the 
folder called 'Contents', and very often you'll find a folder inside 
called plug-ins. The proper plugin can then be dragged right to the 
plugin folder there.

But it sounds to me like Scanwise might have installed the plugin 
[which is probably a bridge of some kind between the scanner and 
Elements.

Good luck, hope that helps.
