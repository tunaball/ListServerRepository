<PRE>According to Michael Bigley:

&gt;&gt;<i>I had formatting plugins in Services, to remove or reformat 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>anything using BBEdit,[things like removing formatting, 'quotes', 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>all caps, etc], also my MoosePad services were there, meaning any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>time I highlighted text in a browser, email, whatever, I could 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>auto-open a new page in MoosePad with the selected text. And those 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>were just two of, perhaps 20 carefully selected apps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It was clearly spelled out in the documentation; third party apps 
</I>&gt;<i>like the above could be disabled...One thing I have learned since 
</I>&gt;<i>the very early releases of OSX is to read the documentation BEFORE 
</I>&gt;<i>upgrading.
</I>&gt;<i>--
</I>
I understand that thinking perfectly well Mike,and agree with it.

However, when I'm on a 3200 dollar computer with 25 grand in 
software, and time is money, and it's my life ( as in 100% of my 
income) AND the system is slower than OS 9, with finder anomalies, a 
system that consumes CPU time and RAM like nobody's business, 
graphics 'issues', and other on-going areas of development, and they 
come out and say 'this update addresses issues with Finder, graphics, 
etc...&quot; I went for it, of course.

And on top of that Apple has encouraged people to tweak the OS for 
efficiency, ease-of-use, etc, for years...

My main grief was over BBEdit's crippled version of Services. I don't 
consider that app to be some 'oddball' WindowShade' 'talking Moose' 
utility, in any way.

In the old days, we buy the machine, that runs the software, that 
lets us work/create. Period. If I wanted to go to the original vendor 
and ask permission to enhance performance with another app, I'd buy a 
Windoze box.

I mean, come on, I'm not saying that a 'cabal' in Cupertino said 
&quot;Hey, he's using BBEdit for text editing instead of TextEdit, let's 
get him!!!&quot; It's just a case of, in my often-times 20-hour workdays, 
I'll use BBEdit countless times, I couldn't care less about Bluetooth 
enabling in the 'global' services menu.

Besides, the OS knows every app on the box, every time it starts, so 
why have Bluetooth  in &quot;Services&quot; constantly eating 'real estate' on 
a box with zero Bluetooth? And how many millions of times will the OS 
have to search for 'Additional start-up folders' before it realizes 
that if there wasn't one on the 'boot up', and no packages have been 
delivered, there isn't going to be one every time i want to reboot 
into 9 or just restart, or boot into single-user?

It's no federal case I'm making, it's simply aggravating, 
unnecessary, and increases, rather than decreases, my workload. You 
know, I had pasta that was over-cooked once, too... didn't stop me 
from eating Italian [I grew up in North beach] but it meant that when 
I break my own 'rule' and order thin pasta in a restaurant, i always 
look the man or woman, taking the order, in the eye, and make sure we 
'understand each other' on the 'don't overcook deal.
