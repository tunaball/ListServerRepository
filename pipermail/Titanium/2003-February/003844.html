<PRE>Thanks to those who replied to my RAM queries. I ended up trying 
18004Memory and the 512MB dimm was $85.
So i added the $14 to get it in 2 days via FedEx (since I saved some 
dough). Well, I'm sure you can tell what's coming.

This is my lovely new 1 GHz TiBook that I just got a week ago, mind you.

Everything has been working great--no problems whatsoever.

So I run out to pick up my FedEx package (cuz they haven't yet entered 
into their system that I want them to just LEAVE packages like everyone
else) after work and flip the book over and take out one of the 256 ram 
chips it shipped with, put in the new 512. I get all the cables hooked 
back up, restart, and I get a
flashing folder/ question mark then a multilingual &quot;hold down your 
power button to shut down now!&quot; On the restart the machine starts 
despite this. What the heck? I haven't had a single problem with this 
machine.

Could it be the RAM? Naw.
Could I have done something goofy putting in? Naw.

So I try to run my Norton CD on the OSX partition and it can't read the 
whole thing!!!!! Sumnuva _____!!!!! I reboot several more times from 
the cd and the OS9
partition try and clean up the drive. So then I get it working fine 
after a couple of hours. All the time i am thinking--oh it was probably 
because of some drivers or some bad software or something or too many 
mp3's or SOMEthing other than RAM. Well, since I am a(n) (idiotic) 
scientist I had to go and put the 512 in again. Hmmm, can you surmise 
what happened?!!!!??!?!?!?!?

Well, i got the wierd screen with a dialogue box in like 12 languages 
telling me to hold the power button to shut down. Fantastic. I took the 
RAM out, replaced the 256 dimm and guess what?
My machine is norm'd again. I guess you get what you pay for. Somebody 
at 18004MEMORY is gonna have a new one torn into 'em tomorrow, i tell 
you what.

Just thought i might warn others out there looking for RAM upgrades. I 
know it's always buyer beware and others who wrote me had no problems 
with 18004 but after this experience I think I will trust others like 
Crucial or Kingston.
