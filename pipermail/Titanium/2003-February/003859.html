Well there is really no comparison today (we're comparing 7 year old
technology here), but what are you talking about booting XP from a cold
start and then you mention it was in a saved state - that's not a cold
start.. I haven't seen too many instances of VPC beating the boot time off a
modern PC (from a real Startup, not Saved).

Back when a fully functional PC was built inside of Mac's - there was no
saved state. After you boot the PC side, you can switch INSTANTLY between
platforms/desktops.. Perform tasks and then switch back to the other while
it worked away in the background. Even the almighty G4 choked pretty
seriouly if you try that with VPC and any flavour of Windblows.

It was truly a 2 brained system able to handle multi-OS multi tasking,
communications and more. When VPC 1 came out around that time, it was almost
a joke.. Much like the Virtual Playstation software Connectix also made..

If a valid attempt was made at doing this again today with say a modern
Intel chip, VPC would dry up and blow away (or at least linger for the
hangers-on like RamDoubler users).
