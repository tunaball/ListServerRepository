In that situation, the reset button was caught behind the casing, but 
wasn't really pushed in all the way. Thus, the button was in a 
hair-trigger condition. Moving the PowerBook might have flexed the 
case enough to momentarily trigger the reset button. This was not a 
case of the reset button being depressed for inordinate lengths of 
time.

I'm talking about holding the reset button (not the main power button 
like someone else thinks) for more than a few seconds. While Kynan 
Shook's response about the PMU board is probably true, what I was 
relating was a recent experience I had with an Apple engineer while I 
was setting up a logic board replacement for my Ti400 (lost the 
external L2 cache, just like the Lombards are experiencing). We went 
through the usual steps regarding software issues and then hardware 
issues. When I said I had held the reset button in for a few seconds, 
the engineer sounded very concerned and wanted to know just how long 
I had held it in, because if you hold it in too long, it would &quot;fry 
the logic board&quot;. I said less than five seconds.There was a pregnant 
pause (probably the engineer typing in some comments), and then we 
went on as usual with the rest of the diagnosis. I wasn't sure what 
to make of it at the time, but I felt from the tone of things that I 
would be risking a Tier 3 repair ($1000 as opposed to a flat-rate 
$378) if I had said anything as long or longer than 10 seconds.
