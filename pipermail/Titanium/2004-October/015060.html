<PRE>Today on slashdot.org, there was/is an article on CherryOS 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.cherryos.com">http://www.cherryos.com</A>&gt; , which allows softies to run a copy of Mac OS 
X/Panther on intel type hardware.  There were of course many comments; I enjoyed 
this comment immensely:

Jerry K

--------------------------------------------------------

&lt;i&gt;it's a shame that Apple doesn't release OS-X for x86 hardware..&lt;/i&gt;

Look, you guys just can't get it through your heads that the reason why OS X 
works so well is because it runs on such a limited pool of hardware-- this 
allows the engineers coding OS X to make assumptions THAT CANNOT BE MADE in the 
x86 world, where a machine could be using one of thousands of motherboards, 
network cards, graphics cards, sound cards, etc. Windows developers have to code 
for the lowest common denominator. OS X developers code for specific hardware. 
Even the version of NeXTStep that ran on Intel hardware ran on a tiny subset of 
the available PC hardware. If your CD-ROM drive and motherboard weren't on the 
&quot;supported hardware&quot; list that came with NeXTStep, you were SOL.

That little fantasy you all have of buying &quot;Mac OS X for x86&quot;, running it on 
some homebuilt shitbox you cobbled together from spare parts, and having it work 
as well as a G5 runs Panther today will NEVER come to pass. Microsoft has spent 
twenty years and untold millions trying to achieve that goal, and they still 
have quite a way to go.

Do you think Jobs could just snap his fingers one day and a few months later 
have a product on the shelves that would run perfectly on every PC capable of 
running XP today? It's impossible. And even if it were possible, you wouldn't 
buy it. Why? Because Apple uses their software to sell their hardware, so a copy 
of OS X for x86 would have to be priced to ease the pain of a lost hardware 
sale-- you'd either do without it and bitterly bitch about the price here on /., 
or you'd pirate it-- either way, Apple would lose money on it.

</PRE>
