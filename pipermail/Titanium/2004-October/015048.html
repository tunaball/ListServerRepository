<PRE>
I have running VPC since 1.0 on my Macs.  I have VPC 6.0 on my 15&quot; 
Al-book under 10.3.5, running Windows XP for about one year.

Now I have something very strange: when Windows XP starts up, the 
final (normal XP screen) has a message balloon that says my &quot;monitor 
resolution is low, click this button to change it&quot;.

But I cannot click on anything or do anything (except restart which I 
have done 100X and I get back to this same place each time).

The Mac cursor seems to be separated now from the VPC cursor.

VPC thinks that the VPC Additions have not been installed (the little 
icon is grey).

If I try to install them, it says you already have them installed do 
you want to replace them?
Which I cannot do because I have no cursor control.

I seem to be in a loop from which I cannot escape.

There seems no way in Windows in VPC to force the VPC to start up 
from the Windows XP install CD.

My friend tells me that on a real PC you can instruct the BIOS to 
start from a CD, but no option seems to exist once Windows is running.

So not only cannot I escape from the loop, I cannot do anything to 
repair or reinstall.

Has anyone reading this got any idea of how to resolve this issue ?

Creating a new PC is one way forward, as a blank disk seems to 
provide the option of booting from the Windows XP install CD.  But 
then I have to go through that long and agonizing WindowsUpdate 
process to update all the software, and downloading Acrobat Reader, 
and all the other programs and utilities that are already on the 
current C: drive....

ANY ideas or comments would be very welcome, so that my Powerbook is 
functional for all environments.

I am sure I had never had any issues like this with Windows 98.

regards,  Trevor
