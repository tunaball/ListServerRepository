<PRE>It tries to read the disk and then just spits it out 30 seconds later?  
You've tried reading a variety of disks (including both burned and ones 
stamped at a factory)?

Optical drives tend to go bad after a while, and I think it's often 
just because they get some dust in the lens.  You have two options; the 
first is to take it in for repair.  It'll probably cost $3-400.  The 
other option is to try and blow it out - if that doesn't work, you 
might end up damaging the drive further (or possibly even something 
else in the computer), and I take no responsibility if you choose to do 
this...  But it sometimes works, and it'll save you some money.  Best 
option would be to use an air compressor.  A few weeks ago, this 
happened to my sister, and I had her use a bike pump.  It's probably 
not the best source of air, but it worked for her.
I'm not sure I'd recommend using any of that canned air you can buy 
(for the purpose of blowing out electronics) because you might end up 
spraying the liquid all over the place in a confined space such as the 
optical drive.  Similarly, just blowing by mouth can get saliva or 
other things in the slot.  Anyway, just turn the computer off, point 
some air in the slot, blow for a while, turn it back on, and give the 
optical drive another try.

Try it at your own risk...
