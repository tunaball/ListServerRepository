One of my fondest Mac memories was a class like this!
But be wary of one thing:

Call first to make sure it's really hands on, and that you aren't 
paying for a video presentation!
That has to be the biggest rip-off!
I took one of these classes a LONG way back when, and it was GREAT! 
They had rented the Mac PPCs of all stripes, we were two to a Mac and 
we learned EVERYTHING including taking them apart and putting them back 
together again. While we were out for lunch on the second day, the 
instructor screwed up the machines each in a different way and we were 
to figure it out.
My partner (a new female IT person who worked for the phone co and was 
interested in learning about Macs) and I won both troubleshooting 
contests...we had a blast and I made some new friends that I still keep 
in touch with today including the instructor who I often see at each 
EXPO.
But as I said, call first to find out if it's hands on...
