That is exactly what I have been doing...and the IP change is actually 
good because I only want certain people to know that URL, not the whole 
world. I do have to reboot quite often to recover memory....but that's 
another whole ball of wax that I'd rather not get into right now.

&gt;<i> I also like this for seeing my work in progress; you can do this..

....already &quot;been there and doing that&quot; but will leave your notes

</I>&gt;<i> before I upload some potentially broken code to the live web server.
</I>
I am not sure if you read my last post, but I think we established that 
this is what I have been doing, and that this is why X became useful, 
but that I do not yet have a mail program that I like to work with.

&gt;<i> I suppose you could have multiple sites in separate folders within the 
</I>&gt;<i> sites folder, then give clients a URL of &quot;ipaddres/~user/client...
</I>
No supposing about it. I have many sites in there now. That  is not the 
problem. You just have to remember to back that copy up to another 
location for safety's sake.

&gt;<i> There is detailed, but easy to configure, explanations of how to turn 
</I>&gt;<i> your OSX box into a web server for more complex stuff at 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.macdevcenter.com">http://www.macdevcenter.com</A>&gt;. Another good dev site is 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="Http://www.phpmac.com">Http://www.phpmac.com</A>&gt;... they also have a link to a very good forum 
</I>&gt;<i> with a special section for developing on a Mac. And while I am posting 
</I>&gt;<i> links, Apple has an excellent internet development section beginning 
</I>&gt;<i> here: &lt;<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/internet/index.html">http://developer.apple.com/internet/index.html</A>&gt;. The end of 
</I>&gt;<i> each section usually has links to more intermediate/expert level &gt; sites.
</I>
While the above information is all well and good and may help someone 
in need of it to start on using their webserver, the problem I posted 
about was the tie-in to mac.com and my lack of satisfaction with the 
mail program on X.
