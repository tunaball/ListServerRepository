<PRE>	I have been allowed to buy a new laptop for work - I was told to get a 
top of the line. I responded that I could do this for probably $2500 
due to the fact that I can install my own memory and don't require a 
17&quot; display. What would you do? What should I do? If it requires more 
$, I will say so but I want to reasonable. Whatever I get needs to last 
a couple of years. I currently have a Ti 400. I don't want to make the 
mistake that I made with that one. The 1st gen Ti was crippled by 
design. have a speedy enough desktop at work and at home so the 
Powerbook is mostly for work on the road which may be only a few days a 
month but much will be done with it in conjuction with the desktops. My 
work machine is a new Dell PC but it won't do what the P'Book will as 
flexibly. I use a combination of Excel, GoLive, Photoshop, iPhoto, OSX 
PDF, Acrobat, Omni Graffle and lots of scans. I can plug my work LCD 
into the powerbook for work when needed at the desk and use the dualie 
when at home.

	ALSO! - I saw the image of Woz's Big AL on a flight and was wondering 
where I can get that porcelain toilet icon for my trash......
