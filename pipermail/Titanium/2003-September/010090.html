</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As far as rumors go, there are better ones than anything to do with

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One of the things that might keep Apple from popping a G5 into a

</I>&gt;<i>already-popular G4 books. Not such a wise move, considering they're 
</I>&gt;<i>'lucky', in a way, that IBM is cutting them in on the G5 action, 
</I>&gt;<i>anyway. Remember IBM is going to be using what they must hope are 
</I>&gt;<i>huge numbers of G5s to run servers and whatnot. If the IBM G5,

I heard from an Apple engineer that the problem was that since the G5 
can put more traces into space, that it puts out the same amount of 
heat has the G4 chip, but, that the die of the G5 is smaller, thus 
you have a higher heat/area ratio that would create problems with 
cooling.  Though they've worked it out on the towers, and there were 
links to a UK site that talked with an Apple engineer about the 
issues with getting G5 into a portable 
(<A HREF="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/top_news_item.cfm?NewsID=6916">http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/top_news_item.cfm?NewsID=6916</A>), and 
he did point out that we were saying the same thing about the G4 
processors, so we only need to wait.
Maybe multi-core G4s!
