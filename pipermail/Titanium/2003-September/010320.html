</I>What you're experiencing here is a so-called kernel panic. When this 
happens, it most likely means that some kernel extension isn't playing 
nice. A log file is (most likely) written to /Library/Logs/panic.log, 
which might tell you more about the kernel extension involved. Don't be 
scared by all the strange numbers and characters, just read the 
readable bits.

&gt;<i> When I do, and then start up again, there's the photo-card icon on my 
</I>&gt;<i> screen - I can now download the photos into iPhoto.
</I>&gt;<i> I've gone back to the store where I bought the adapter from, and they 
</I>&gt;<i> said it might be the adapter, so they gave me a new one.  But I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> getting the same problem.
</I>It sounds that the driver (kernel extension) isn't quite up to the task 
it was designed for. Perhaps the manufacturer has a new driver on its 
web site?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a known issue for Titanium users?  Do I need some software, or 
</I>&gt;<i> drivers, or something else?
</I>My guess is that a new driver could solve the problem. You might even 
try your luck on Google to get a driver for a similar product from a 
different manufacturer.

I had the same kind of problems with my USB2.0 pcmcia card. Luckily 
10.2.8 solved that problem for me. And before I upgraded, I manually 
removed the 3rd party kernel extensions from my system and rebooted. 
This way I hoped not to get into kext-conflicts with the installer. Did 
you upgraded to 10.2.8? And did you remove 3rd party extensions? (Just 
some random thoughts)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any advice would be most appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> Malcolm
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>As always, YMMV, use at your own risk, etc.

Kind regards,

Arjan Bos
