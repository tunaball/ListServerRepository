Ahem, no dear, DOMAINS. I have at least one customized email that comes  
to me from each of the domains I manage.
  Then Mail just shuts down.......and won't budge and the accounts  
become greyed out.

I think Comcast was having a problem with sending/receiving mail last  
night and even if I waited an hour, I could not send mail and go the  
&quot;too many connections&quot; error. Other times it would not send, would just  
go in the outbox, and there would be NO error message.

&gt;<i> Maybe you have a keychain problem??  Have you ran any diags against  
</I>&gt;<i> it?  There was a good article about a week ago on  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.macosxhints.com">http://www.macosxhints.com</A> with password problems.  Here is the

I nuked Keychain long ago. Each time I update or install, it puts me  
back in keychain but I just nuked it again. (Remove all stuff from it)  
It's bothersome because I am the sole user of all the computers in here  
and it slows me down.

&gt;<i> I have written PHP stuff for web services, and I have FTP'ed files  
</I>&gt;<i> between systems, but I don't understand how you are trying to relate  
</I>&gt;<i> this to Mail.app.  Can you please explain this further??
</I>
Because those functions reside on X machine but my favorite mail  
program does not. So I have to suffer with this lame mail.app which I  
wish they would make more like Emailer was. And text only! I mean,  
what's with these blank things in the mail message? Or sometimes NOT  
blank? Weird.

&gt;<i> I would also add again that all my user accounts are configured for  
</I>&gt;<i> IMAP over SSL and I do full message caching.  The caching may be what  
</I>&gt;<i> is saving me and keeping my configuration usable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I just want it to do plain text email, reliably!
Hopefully this was all Comcast's fault and not mail.app and that  
mail.app displayed that message because the mail was rejected from the  
server and it did not know what else to report it as, the 1/3 of the  
time it gave me an error.

Time will tell.
