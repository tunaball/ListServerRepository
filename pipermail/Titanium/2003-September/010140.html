And I'm sorry I reacted thusly.  OS X is unix, and IMHO, learning to 
use the Unix shell is a great tool.  I still prefer the shell over 
Finder for many things because Finder has its share of problems, 
especially in dealing with network mounts that have gone stale.  The 
beauty of OS X, and Woz, you, and others have pointed this out, is that 
you don't *have* to go the shell if you don't want to.  There's lots of 
great graphical tools, like Cocktail, that can help with problems.  
I've been dealing with Unix shells and arcane interfaces like KDE or 
Gnome for so long that OS X is like a breath of fresh air in Unix 
usability.  But it's still not perfect.  I learn new things all the 
time - like I didn't know you could drag a file from Finder to the 
terminal and it would put the path in the terminal :-)  Coming from my 
background, I always type the first few letters of the path then hit 
the 'Tab' key to let the shell finish filling in the path for me.

But the bottom line is, I'm not as versed in the Macintosh interface as 
some here, so I resort to the shell when things don't work at the GUI.  
I'm learning more and more to use the GUI, but it's as hard for me to 
do that as it is for a GUI user to use the shell :-)
