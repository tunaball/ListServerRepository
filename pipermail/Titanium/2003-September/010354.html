<PRE>Tarik paused, thought it over, and spoke thusly:

Well, thanks. I'm not on AppleCare, instead I bought a couple of 
extended care packages from the dealer, at the time, and the dealer 
is being very noncommittal about it all. I ran the Apple Hardware 
test CD and it showed no problems with the &quot;Logic Board&quot;, but, as you 
mentioned, who knows what is meant by that.

I use heavy duty surge protection, always. A direct hit from 
lightning, on a house I lived in down south, killed a PC in the 
house, blinked all the lights and reset all digital gear...but my 
external monitor blinked, momentarily, and a large file transfer, 
that was in progress at the time, carried on as if nothing had 
happened. My external FireWire drive kept right on working also, so I 
have a hard time believing there was an incident with sufficient 
'juice', after the direct hit on the house, to knock out the port...

External devices 'power-up' on the FireWire bus, but aren't detected, 
so, who knows? Thanks for your input.
