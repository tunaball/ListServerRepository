It sounds like you have some sort of power management problem. It could 
also be that it caused both of your previous failures that required 
replacement of other parts, but was not properly diagnosed or discovered at 
those times. I've had power system faults cause failures in other parts of 
the machine on more than one occasion making for very expensive repair 
costs if off warranty.

I notice your area code, if correct, puts you within easy striking distance 
of the Mall of America Apple Store. I've had pretty good luck with the 
Geniuses there a couple of times so go and have them take a look. If it is 
the battery or charger, they will be able to check that. It may have to go 
back for repair again, but it seems they should help you get expedited or 
better service since this is the 3rd time.

(Thanks to Lisbeth Zachs for the helpful repost.)
