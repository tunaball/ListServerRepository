<PRE>Cyn offered:

&gt;<i>And now back to the real me: I can feel your pain, it happened to me 
</I>&gt;<i>a few years back. The above comments were what I got from those it 
</I>&gt;<i>never happened to. You won't get sympathy from those who never had 
</I>&gt;<i>it happen to them but you have my sympathy. Just remember, you still 
</I>&gt;<i>have one hell of a computer and can get top dollar if you really 
</I>&gt;<i>want to part with it now and move up. I didn't back when it happened 
</I>&gt;<i>to me and I was never sorry because I did buy the computer at the 
</I>&gt;<i>time because I thought it was more than enough to meet my needs.
</I>
Exactly. I, as i mentioned previously, bought a 667 Ti, that was 
delivered exactly one day before Mr. Jobs announced the 800. Although 
i bought through an Apple-authorized dealer, I accepted that. Having 
been around for a while, it is not 'news' that there will always be 
new things.

But the upshot, which won't make sense to the early adopters out 
there is this: I absolutely love my Ti-Book, plain and simple. Witha 
GB of RAM, and external monitor, TurboPro Mouse, and keyboards, it is 
amazing.

The office I visit [on payday only] has several of my older Macs, 
7200s to 9600s, but also, we have an old SE30 in there, just for fun. 
I fully remember wishing I had the dough for one of them when they 
first appeared.

My only real 'wish', regarding newer features and whatnot, would be 
about the video card. I would love to be able to run at least a 32MB 
card in the 667, with two monitors, as the 2 monitors 'split' the 
16MB on the radeon that shipped with the 667s. Oh well.

I already see a 'reconditioned' 17&quot; Ti, maxed on RAM, both regular 
and video, some time shortly after the advent of the dual-DDRs. A 
later 'rev', and who knows which version of 10.X.x....

Patience isn't just a virtue, it's a necessity.

P.S. My laptop, before the 667? A Powerbook 150  &lt;laughs&gt; And i loved 
that one too.
