<PRE>I guess with this formula I could consider my 550 a swift little 360 Spider
or something? Hehe.

Seriously - I see no space to complain. The GigSDTi is a beautiful machine -
not &quot;obsolete&quot; by any means.. Take a peek at some forum discussions.. Weak
Graphics Card - No Purpose for 802.11g - No devices to use FireWire800 -
Extremely limited functionality with BlueTooth - USB ports on both sides of
the machine.. And the thing hasn't even hit the streets yet!

People (I assume GigSDTi owners) are really beating on this machine. It will
fit some peoples purpose perfectly (4 months and counting for me).. But it
is in no way leaps and bounds above what you have. Although that screen and
new keyboard are drop dead amazing.

Some of you are having a hard time with what has happened - but it does
happen all the time. I have felt the sting myself - heck I even owned a
7200!! This is the game we play with wanting to have and hold the latest and
greatest - sometimes letting that eagerness overpower common sense and cause
extreme short-sightedness. Not to mention Xmas having WAY too big an impact
on it all.

Enjoy your machine, it wasn't going to be the hottest thing on the block
forever.

(also without a Ferrari or SDTi)
