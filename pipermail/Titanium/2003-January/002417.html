</I>&gt;<i> Henry,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> it is not that I do not see your point or do not agree in general but 
</I>&gt;<i> the market share figure looks like it is a bit biased. For one thing it 
</I>&gt;<i> is Apple vs all others. If we take Apple vs individual manufacturer 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple is the third largest manufacturer AND it is the one best doing 
</I>&gt;<i> financially.
</I>&gt;<i> Second: the market share takes into account the sale of software for 
</I>&gt;<i> the platforms. The comparison there sometime amount to Windows vs Apple.
</I>&gt;<i> Hybrid CDs (presenting program valid for a Windows installation and a 
</I>&gt;<i> Mac installation) count as Windows sale.
</I>&gt;<i> Internet presence: Mac amounts to some 11+% presence of existing 
</I>&gt;<i> computers. From other reported figures (in this same list) Apple has 
</I>&gt;<i> been recently the leader presence in the whole market if you split down 
</I>&gt;<i> to the single manufacturer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Safari now reports 24% of the whole internet traffic. How 2.3% market 
</I>&gt;<i> share computing platform could provide 24% of all internet traffic?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is known that the iMac has been the best PC selling so far (crude 
</I>&gt;<i> sales) , the TiBook (I might be wrong) the best or next to the best.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have yet to find a single definition of this 2.3% market share 
</I>&gt;<i> presence of Apple (it has been reported US presence is 3% now).
</I>&gt;<i> So until I get a crisp unambiguous definition of market share that does 
</I>&gt;<i> not provides different numbers depending on who is doing the actual 
</I>&gt;<i> computation I get all this business as the myth Apple bashers are 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to spread: &quot;Apple is about to close&quot;. Analysts report Apple 
</I>&gt;<i> market share shrinking since 1984. If that was true Apple would have 
</I>&gt;<i> been long gone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If a single user buys 3 PC in two years (likely to happens) that counts 
</I>&gt;<i> as 3 PCs while instead on reality only one PC still runs.
</I>&gt;<i> Corporations change the entire base of PC by the wagon: nobody says 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;well, OK, it is not that PC presence has EVER increased, you know!!!&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> it counts as increased presence of PC in the market. Those PC end up 
</I>&gt;<i> nonetheless into incinerator.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that even with all that, analysts say that market share has 
</I>&gt;<i> increased from 2.3% to 3% in the US tells instead that some of those PC 
</I>&gt;<i> users - actually a considerable part of PC users - is now adopting a 
</I>&gt;<i> Mac. Maybe they are keeping the PC but out of those 3 PC they would 
</I>&gt;<i> have bought, this time one is an Apple computer. This has never 
</I>&gt;<i> happened before. I would not be surprised if this little figure of 
</I>&gt;<i> market share will keep increasing even if pro-PC analysts will try to 
</I>&gt;<i> do their best to prove the contrary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the last 2 years I have seen with my eyeballs more Windows users 
</I>&gt;<i> switch to the Mac than in all my professional life which has started in 
</I>&gt;<i> 1988.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, before these two years, I was the only one swticher (happened 
</I>&gt;<i> in 1997) that I personally knew.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This said I agree with you: Apple should prove Windows users that they 
</I>&gt;<i> will not lose anything moving to the platform, actually they will gain. 
</I>&gt;<i> I think slowly the message is being received.
</I>
AMEN

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If by &quot;using their own PC stuff JUST AS WELL&quot; on the Mac you mean get a 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows program installer and install it directly on the Mac, 
</I>&gt;<i> presonally I do not see how this would ever be possible with the 
</I>&gt;<i> current architecture. Will an IBM or AMD collaboration lead to that? 
</I>&gt;<i> Doubt so.
</I>&gt;<i> How would that work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I am seeing it instead as a realization of what you say is in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Unix world. Today I was experience exactly that: we were doing some 
</I>&gt;<i> prototyping on a Red Hat 7.x Linux machine with some C++ programs. I 
</I>&gt;<i> had just to get the exact same source files, compile them on the OS X 
</I>&gt;<i> and get the exact same results. This is why I see more and more Macs in 
</I>&gt;<i> the scientific and academic community: they are just popping out as 
</I>&gt;<i> mushrooms.
</I>
Excellent example! Linux is expanding precisely because there's no need to
invest in any new hardware! Now, I'm NOT a programmer - but I'm sure there
are enough knowledgeable people at Apple to figure something out - either
a Mac OS running on Wintels or a Mac capable of running Mac OS *and*
Windoze and Linux, or a Mac OS capable of taking any current Windoze
Application and running it in a Mac environment...Can't be done, you say?
Well - Jules Verne envisioned a flight to the moon, wireless and tons of
other stuff without necessarily having the engineering details outlined.

 Sure it would be radical, with great implications! But
I hope the one thing that would happen is that Apple would thrive.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think Apple is doing what you suggest: run on the Mac the same 
</I>&gt;<i> applications others are running on the PC. And Apple did whatever it 
</I>&gt;<i> took to do that: it killed Mac OS. OS X is not an evolution of the Mac: 
</I>&gt;<i> it  is Unix.
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I do not think we could expect to have Apple run Windows as well 
</I>&gt;<i> ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers

Best,

Henry
