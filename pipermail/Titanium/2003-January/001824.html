Agreed.

Disagreed...In fact, Omni Group does have financial interests in 
OmniWeb. It costs roughly $40. It is far from the only thing Omni does 
- but software development is more central to the company than it was a 
few years ago, when the NeXT consultancy business was flourishing.

Of course, Omni Group's employees are definitely passionate Mac people, 
but they are not doing charity.

Safari is great. The more different rendering engines that get wide 
distribution, the more important it will be for web developers to make 
sure their code is standards compliant. Simply checking your website in 
Netscape and IE for Windows shouldn't be enough - working towards 
standards compliant code should be.

If Apple makes Safari the default and only preinstalled browser in 
future system revisions, then that is certain to make a great 
percentage _not_ run MS IE, which is one step away from a monopoly that 
is hurting the Web.
