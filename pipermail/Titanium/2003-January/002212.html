<PRE>Steve Wozniak has opined:

&quot;I feel that Apple is on the right (great) track (leading edge features and apps and style and ease and etc.) but I have trouble accepting that market share moves the other way.&quot;

I agree with him completely, especially when I am trying to convince other lawyers with whom I work that they should consider Apple products, and the &quot;facts&quot; are going the other way -- at least in terms of their perception.  And it's not limited to professionals; 2.3 percent and Apple's latest loss have to dampen potential sales to all.

Glenn Austin adds:

&quot;Most market share numbers are based on *sales* not *in-use*.&quot;

True, but to approach it otherwise would be like comparing all of the Chevrolets on the road vs. all of the Toyotas, and not focus on new car sales.  Frankly, I had not realized that Apple's share had falled to 2.3 percent until recently, and thought that it still hovered around 5 percent.  Despite wonderful innovations that &quot;rock&quot; the Mac faithful positively, non-Mac people who are urged to switch will likely think twice when they learn about the market share and the loss.  And that's too bad because I believe the people at Apple ARE doing their very best and truly innovating.

Glenn added:

&quot;Most in-use numbers show a 9-12% Macintosh usage share. &#160;Remember, most
Wintel machines are purchased as replacements within a 12-18 month period.

&quot;The problem is that all these sales numbers assume that each machine is
going into service as a new machine, not as a replacement for an existing
machine. &#160;All that they say is that there are 97-99 Wintel machines sold for
every Macintosh sold. &#160;This does not equal 'market share' in spite of those
people who would like it to mean that.&quot;

With all due respect, so what -- the Chevy-Toyota analysis still holds true, certainly with respect to potential &quot;switchers.&quot;

It must be very frustrating to Jobs, et al., to find that Apple's market share has been literally cut in half within a relatively short period of time.
