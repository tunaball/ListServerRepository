IF this were only true!  The fact is that most software is purchased at

same time a new computer is purchased.  Fewer computer purchases means 
fewer
software purchases.  Developers are VERY sensitive to this and 
investing in
Mac development is a very big IF for many of them whereas developing for
Windows is a given... Because there are so many Windows machines sold.

There are developers that are currently abandoning the Mac platform 
despite
the  resurgence because of NUMBERS.  NUMBERS (specifically LOW numbers) 
are
the problem here.

In the 13 years I've been buying computers I've never bought software

very different worlds, you believe that &quot;Fewer computer purchases means 
fewer software purchases&quot; while I would think that indicates that 
people are sticking with the computer they have and buying software for 
it. Remember that pc users buy a new pc (they have to right, they don't 
have the latest gigahertz so they HAVE to upgrade) more frequently than 
Mac users. My typical Mac lasts me 3 years, and at the end of that time 
I don't need to upgrade, I do simply because I want to. The world that 
you see around you is Apple software abandonment and  &quot;NUMBERS 
(specifically LOW numbers)&quot;, I however see the Fink project (hundreds 
of new apps for os X) and tons of new programs for os x at...
