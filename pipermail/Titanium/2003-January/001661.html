<PRE>Ha!  That's probably the most absurd thing I've heard in a LONG time.  
Apple doesn't really have that much in inventory to justify a speed 
bump for two months.  Most likely they realized that the 800 needed a 
boost-FAST.  So they bump the 800 to 1 GHz, add RAM and HD space, and 
toss in quick little extras called a better video card and a 
superdrive.  Sure they knew that there were new products in the 
pipeline, but they were a good 3 months away from being released.  The 
new 12 and 17 inch PowerBooks are an addition to the PowerBook line, 
not a replacement.  I imagine the next time they get bumped they'll get 
many of the same things the 17&quot; has (perhaps the new case, for example; 
we'll see), and they might even get bumped before the 17&quot; does.

Besides, if they have too many parts, they could easily just earmark 
them for service, and if necessary drop the cost of those parts to 
encourage more people to repair heavily-damaged computers.

Honestly, I'm waiting for a new PowerBook myself; I ordered a 15&quot; one a 
while back, and some things got tied up so everything else in my order 
has shipped.  But the PowerBook didn't.  If I can, I'll probably pay 
extra to get the 17&quot;, but they may not allow me to do so for various 
reasons too long to go into here.  But if they can't, I assume I will 
get the lower-priced 15&quot;, and I'll be perfectly content with it; both 
are excellent machines.

And for any of you that just ordered a new PowerBook and it was shipped 
within 10 days of the new PowerBooks, call Apple within 14 days of 
shipping, and you can probably get some money back.
