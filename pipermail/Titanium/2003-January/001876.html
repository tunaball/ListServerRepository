&gt;<i>And to answer cbirds's question: Safari has the ability to search for 
</I>&gt;<i>other Rendezvoud enabled devices/servers.  This allows Safari to 
</I>&gt;<i>automatically &quot;see&quot; other Rendezvous Macs, or in this case, a 
</I>&gt;<i>Rendezvous web server.  If you enable the Rendezvous Bookmark Bar in 
</I>&gt;<i>Safari and you have your OSX Apache server running mod_rendezvous, then 
</I>&gt;<i>when you click on the bookmark bar, your web server will automatically 
</I>&gt;<i>be found and listed here.  You don't have to know the name of the 
</I>&gt;<i>server.  That's the big benefit.  Imagine you're working in a large 
</I>&gt;<i>company and different divisions have their own internal web domains.  
</I>&gt;<i>With Rendezvous, you wouldn't have to remember all their names, you'd 
</I>&gt;<i>just click on the Rendezvous Bookmark Bar and you'd see a list of all 
</I>&gt;<i>the available domains.  Hope this helps.

I see what you are saying. It's not something my users would understand 
or use, but it's very useful to those who run a server from their 
machines..

(Believe me, if I copied word for word some of the tech questions I got 
yesterday you would see the level of knowledge of the people I support 
and you would be appalled....!!! Even when I answer them in the simplest 
terms, they just do not get it and think I am above their heads. For 
example, I included a text clipping, which of course is by itself not 
editable, just so folks could see what files to trash to help keep their 
browser clean. They have been doing this for YEARS. Yet one insisted 
should could not delete the Cache f because it was just a list and 
nothing would move! It's of course a list of files I placed within that 
same USERS folder, for her convenience, to know what to dump each 
time....&lt;sigh&gt; Another user wanted to know why the .wp (what the he** is 
that?) document she sent me did not show the correct font she used for 
her signature. They have no clue that a text document is not a word 
document is not a web document and their fancy signature is not going to 
show up! Some of this is just plain common sense, and like they say, if 
common sense is so common why do so few people have it! LOL).
