Here? I am here ;-)
I see.. My wording made it sound as though I took the picture?
I only assumed (oops) the location from the caption that said &quot;au bon
Bangkok, Thailand&quot;. A caf&#233; there perhaps?

I only linked to that picture that is on the iPod Lounge (iPod's Around the
World) section.

&gt;<i> Was this a japanese guys machine? If so then he might have been  covering up
</I>&gt;<i> his paint peeling under the machine. He had a lot of  cosmetic damage on this
</I>&gt;<i> machine. I suspect this might have been  &quot;Chai's&quot; machine. An ex Japanese Pro
</I>&gt;<i> Motorocycle racer who I met on my  last trip to Thailand. He's always hanging
</I>&gt;<i> out there. 
</I>
If this is the machine of the guy you met, what a funny coincidence. Small
small world. The bike on the screen is a big hint eh?

I probably wouldn't use this before my warranty ran out. I do love the look
of my Ti.

&gt;<i> I don't think  that item was found in Thailand. He makes regular
</I>&gt;<i> trips to Japan and I  think he got it there. He also carrys his machine in a
</I>&gt;<i> Dr Botts Ti-case  most of the time.
</I>
Nice.. Go in style I always say.
I have tried searching with as many different names/descriptions as I can
think of for this cover. Do you think he may have manufactured it himself?
Or had someone do it for him? I could see this not exisiting online at all.

Thanks for the info Robert.
