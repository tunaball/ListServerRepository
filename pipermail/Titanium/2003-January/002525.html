<PRE>I spend a significant amount of time each week sending pro-Mac e-mail 
around the campus where I teach; evangelizing the advantages of Mac's 
lower TOC (Total Cost of Ownership) plus better performance and 
security.  Last semester, we were hit hard with a Windows virus that 
took down a main server and infected many desktop machines.  I wrote a 
stirring e-mail advocating that we throw Microsoft products off our 
campus and adopt an all-Unix policy, including use of open source 
software whenever possible.  That got a big response, not much of it 
positive.

Does anyone actually understand MS's educational licensing?  The college 
is paying a fortune for campus-wide Microsoft licensing, yet not a cent 
goes for Macintosh versions of MS products, like Office.  The same for 
operating systems.  Windows XP all around, while I have to spend my own 
program's budget to upgrade MacOS versions.  I have to my own Office X 
while everyone else on campus who uses a Wintel box has Office XP 
installed automatically.

You're right, this is discrimination and prejudice in the worst form. 
Highly educated people ought to be able to see a better way, right.  We 
need some affirmative action for Macintosh technology.
