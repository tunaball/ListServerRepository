Colin is right.  And let's not call people morons.  Technically challenged, sure.  The foundation of Michael Kanellos Tech News CNET argument is (I quote):

&quot;If Apple had changed the course of history in the 1980s and emerged as the guiding force in computing, we'd be up to our necks in graphic artists, freelance DJs and career temp employees.)

Microsoft and Intel understand this completely. Standards exist in the industry not because of a secret, evil conspiracy. They exist because, in many circumstances, conformity is more important than perfection. That's why the two companies, and the rest of the PC market, spend more time talking about price and availability than anything else.&quot;  End of quote.

I am not a fan of the cult-like attitudes of many Mac users.  Every MacWorld comes across like a meeting of &quot;trekkies&quot; pouring over a new Leonard Nimoy &quot;I Could Be Spock&quot; book.  So I can understand the uninitiated attempting an attack on all Mac users based upon the histrionics of a few.  However, facts are facts and the fact is the Macintosh is far and away a more stable platform than any Windows machine out there.

Mac attracts artists, no doubt, but the reason is simple:  Mac gives the artists a creative platform that is artistic.  But Mr. Kanellos erred when he brought his personal frustrations into his criticism.  He lost all credibility.

The Mac is an evolutionary platform.  It is more intuitive, simply elegant and straight forward than any PC.

Remember the monkeys in Kubirck's 2001: A Space Odyssey?  Kanellos problem is that he fears if he touches the object of his greatest desire he will become that object.  Well, Jobs and Woz saw that future at XEROX PARK, low those many years ago, and had the foresight to move it into the market place because neither xerox or IBM would do it.

If PC users spend there time talking about price and availability, Michael, it is because that is about all they can talk about.  Unless, of course, they want to compare &quot;system crash&quot; numbers.

Kanellos said, &quot;Conformity is more important than perfection.&quot;  You see, Michael, conformity is often the death of individuality and creativity, and it is killing the PC world.  And that is exactly what Macintosh said to the market through its 1984 &quot;Hammer&quot; advertisement and what it says to this very day in its &quot;Genius&quot; campaign.  But most importantly, this philosophy is Apple's touchstone in its design and development of all Apple products.

Mr. Kanellos should take a cue from Bill Gates, the single most influential businessman of the PC world and BUY STOCK in Macintosh...it's where the future is created and where technical innovation is at home.
