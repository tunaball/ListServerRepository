IF Mac sales slip far down enough that 3rd parties abandon the platform
(which was happening when Apple nearly sank in 1997) your needs will  
NOT be
met.  There is a critical mass level of Mac sales that must be met or  
the
whole shooting match is going up in flames because 3rd parties will stop
developing for the platform.

I do not see this idea as obscure, yet many seem to be unable to grasp  
how
the market works: hardware sales drive software sales which in turn spur
continued software development by 3rd parties.

If you really want to worry about a computer company failing maybe you  
should check out Sun...
&quot;Sun Microsystems Inc., saddled with huge acquisition costs, posted a  
$2.3 billion quarterly loss on Thursday -- its largest ever.&quot;
With Apple numbers like these (see below) I have absolutely no worries  
about Apple or third party developers including the hundreds that just  
jumped in from the UNIX world. Are you really worried about Apple?

from:   <A HREF="http://www.alliedcomputing.com/default.php?news_id=50">http://www.alliedcomputing.com/default.php?news_id=50</A>
Of the 275 million personal computers in the world today, 32 million of  
them run some version of the Mac OS. Folks, that's not 5%, like the  
urban legend has it; that's 11.6% of the worldwide personal computer  
market. And, it's certainly not the 3% or so recently published as the  
Mac's share of new computer sales.
The Hardware Numbers

To cap off this interesting study, I'll now share one more group of  
estimates with you: the percentages of installed personal computers  
around the world, by manufacturer. These numbers are drawn a from about  
20 different fragmentary sources, and have been compiled by me, to the  
point that I am confident in their general accuracy. Take a look.

11.6% Apple
10.4% Compaq
9.8% Dell
9.1% IBM
7.3% Hewlett-Packard
5.1% Sony
3.4% Toshiba
3.1% NEC
3.0% Packard-Bell
2.1% eMachines
1.7% Microstar
1.3% Fujitsu
32.1% Others (each less than 1%)

for more Apple numbers...

comments.pl?sid=51044&amp;cid=0&amp;pid=0&amp;startat=&amp;threshold=1&amp;mode=thread&amp;comme 
ntsort=3&amp;op=Change
from slashdot.org...

&quot;They've got 4.4 BILLION (that's Billion, with a B) in the bank.
Somehow, I fail to be able to dredge up anything resembling panic for  
Apple's future.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, at their current burn rate, they'll be out of business in  
137 years. I'd better get a PC soon.&quot;

&quot;That amounts to a cash total of about $12 per share. Apple could just  
about buy back all their public shares with the money they have in  
reserve.
Put another way, they could take a $250M quarterly hit over four years  
&amp; *still* be around! &quot;

I'm definitely not worried. Are you?
Kevin
