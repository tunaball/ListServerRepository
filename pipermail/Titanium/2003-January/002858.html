<PRE>

In regards to the battery situation, I currently own a 1GB superdrive PB,
picked up an extra battery for myself, and ordered another one for another
member of this list.  All are supposed to be the 16V battery, although they
all have the 14.4V listed on he back.  The boxes of the two extra batteries
have M8244G/B marked on them which is the proper code for the 16V batteries.
M8244G/A is for the 14.4V battery.  And the SN on the outside of the box
does not match the serial number on the battery itself, for either one, as
mentioned earlier this list earlier.
SO, I first checked on the Apple GSX Support site, the box numbers are
correct, but the SN cannot be run through via that site.

 So I called Apple.

After a fairly long discussion with several techs, and a supervisor, it was
determined via the SN on the batteries, that all are the 16V batteries,
although the labels state 14.4.  Apparently the labels were applied to a run
of batteries that were really 16V, creating the confusion.  This is what
they said.  They said that actually these 16.6 mislabeled batteries have
been shipping for a couple of months now, and that only the very first 1GB
Superdrive PB may have some of the 14.4V batteries that shipping with the
DVI 800 PB.  The batteries before the DVI models were different again, but
also 14.4.  Got all of that? :)
So, all I know is that my Ti is running fine, battery life is great, and no
other problems.  I leave my extra batteries always around 40 percent when
stored, otherwise if I know that I will use in the next few days or so, I
charge it and bring it.
Just my two cents and experience as of late.
Cheers
FRED
