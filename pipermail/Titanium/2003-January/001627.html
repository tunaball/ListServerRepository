<PRE>Often I hear people complain/crit the PowerBooks size and being &quot;too large
for travelling&quot;. I think that has to be taken into a new context and the new
books reflect exactly what people want/need. (ok sticking my neck out here).

I bought my Ti with the purpose of not using it on the road specifically (as
in while commuting/flying), but to have a &quot;desktop replacement&quot; that I could
carry anywhere I needed, using it more likely at an end destination or for
some specific purpose (moving files at the printer).

Now the ultimate solution exists. If you need the full power with true
working portability you get the Minibook. If you're like me and want the
full show to slip into a (big) bag and haul around - SOLD!

Plus the current line up of SuperDrive Ti's will more than fully meet MOST
users' needs for some time to come. I for one am not ready to update any
devices to Firewire 800 and I don't own anything BlueTooth (outside of a
cell phone what other true functionality exists right now?)

I would be choked if I just bought a SDBook, but to be honest I was
extremely surprised at the blazing speed at which people were buying these
things. I was somehow getting the impression that people felt this was the
&quot;Best, last, no way to be improved, ride this one out for the long-haul
'cause nothing else is coming forever notebook..&quot; It isn't.

I think I will go for a 17&quot;PB, but no sooner than 3 months after it hits the
streets. Maybe even next rev.
