<PRE>As a lawyer, despite my professional lack of insight, I've spoken to a 
number of my colleagues and have helped open their eyes to the 
possibilities of Apple computers.  I think we're probably the biggest 
marketing opportunity for Apple at the moment for a host of reasons: 
most of us can afford the products, we need reliability, courtroom 
lawyers could benefit from the Mac's graphics and multimedia capacity, 
etc.

There are a number of resources (all outside of Apple, as far as I 
know) devoted to supporting lawyers who use Macs, but we could sure use 
some outreach from the company.
