<PRE>Now I am to get a refund for the 15 inch I already had delivered (see
previous post -Fujitsu Drive Troubles?/ apple support issue, and that saga
got worse), and had, before the recent announcements, ordered a replacement
15 inch. I guess i am due to get the new software bundle, and am saving
about 15% on the previous price. It has not yet been delivered.

Thinking it over though, I am asking myself whether in fact I want the 12
inch model.

I will use it for work - with the office suite, and photoshop, dv
editing/dvd recording, itunes etc for myself.

Is there really a great difference in performance between the 15 and 12
inch? The spec sheet details as to the different video cards mean nothing to
me- is there a real difference, and will 1 gig perform that much better than
867? Will the screen size make a big difference for photos dvds?

I expect to get the t68 mobile phone, so I guess there is a marginal upside
in having the dongle built in.

The only downside of my original choice of the 15 inch, from the outset, is
the size and weight - I am used to a lightweight small sony vaio- where the
size and weight is a boon, as I travel a lot and use the laptop constantly.
The hinges on the 12 inch do seem more robust - I imnmediately thought those
on the 15 inch were likely to cause problems in the longer term.

I would beef up the RAM whichever model I got, and would order 60 gb memory
if I got the 12 inch.

The downside is I got the 15 inch Brenthaven case as a CHristmas present -
great case, though I guess I could shell out and get the brenthaven 12
rucksack with the money I saved.

Any thoughts from the group?

Thanks in advance

Paul

Subject: Fujitsu Drive Troubles?/ apple support issue


&gt;<i> Anyone had any problems with the drives in their new Powerbooks?
</I>
I don't know if its a problem with the drive but my new one crashed every
time I used it, in each application - got it on 23/12, then used it on
27/12.
Support told me to run sthg in unix- like sfck?
and that showed no problems

so then told me to try the first aid in the install disk - with that i
couldnt get past the &quot;which language&quot; stage, and ditto with the hardware
test.

So they told me they would collect it to have their tech people repair it,
[not sure if this gets off-topic, now, but advice would be appreciated) ....
a week ago today on sat 28/12, but that because apples systems were being
upgraded they would not be able to pick it up until the 2nd, and I should
phone up on the 2nd to give a pick-up address.

Now this caused me problems, because I commute between London and Paris, and
am never sure of my movements, and am often away from any given address,
work or home. Anyhow, I found somewhere to leave it, my parents, about 100
miles from London. I phoned apple to tell them what I was doing, and that my
parents would be in on the second, for the collection on the 2nd, they said
OK, but couldnt take the address because the system was down.

I made the call on the 2nd. I was then told that the pick-up may be the 2nd,
or the 3rd, but they would try to make sure it was the 2nd, and also that
its not a simple pick-up. They get DHL to deliver an empty box, you pack the
computer in, and then they send another courier to pick it up. So I asked my
parents to stay in for the 3rd, yesterday.

No one had turned up by yesterday mid-day, so I spent an hour on the phone
to apple (from France to the UK). I was initially told that I would
proabably have to wait till Monday, and that if I wanted Saturday
collection, I would have to pay 25 pounds. I was pretty outraged, but after
an hour of calls got through to customer service who said it would be
collected this morning, and the courier would wait for the box to be packed
and take it away, The repair would be prioritised.

Believe it or not no courier materialised.

I phoned apple and spoke to a manager in tech support, who said the courier
could deliver Monday, and he would refer it to customer support on Monday -
they don't work weekends.  My parents are mostly away during the daytime
over the next few weeks, and in any case I can't ask my parents to stay in
any more.

EAch phone call apple has suggested I take it back to the retailer, John
Lewis. I waited 6 weeks for mine, and can't afford to wait that long. Having
phoned around, it appears the other retailers have a similar waiting list. I
actually need the machine for work as my 3 year old vaio is getting pretty
unstable, with hinges coming loose etc. Travelling like I do, a laptop is
vital.

SO my powerbook is 100 miles out of London, and I won't be able to pick it
up to return it till mid-Feb. I am without a pb- I actually think i'd be
better off buying another, being as this one is already problematic, but
being down 5000 pounds just after Christmas won't be easy.
(The reason I bought from J Lewis is that they offer a 2 year guarntee)

Any suggestions? What treatment should I expect of Apple, if I were in the
US?

Paul
