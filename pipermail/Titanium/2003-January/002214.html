<PRE>&gt;<i>With all due respect, so what -- the Chevy-Toyota analysis still 
</I>&gt;<i>holds true, certainly with respect to potential &quot;switchers.&quot;
</I>

What???  GM is no doubt very relieved that they only have to be 
measured on new car sales. If longevity, i.e. vehicles on the road, 
were the measure, they would look awful for the Chevy compared to 
Toyotas. Besides Apple and Microsoft aren't 'strictly' competitors.

I can't believe it, one lousy article in the LATimes, itself hardly a 
'economic insight' powerhouse, and guys start worrying about poor ol' 
Apple. Relax, Apple made more cash, on a percentage basis, which is 
what matters, than Microsoft and nearly the entire tech industry over 
the last five years, They've had the largest selling BRANDED laptops 
for years, also. They're sitting on cash. Their engineers are 
fanatics. researchers and scientists are snapping up the OSX Mac, the 
Wall Street Journal loves 'em, and they're in boardrooms and TV spots 
all over the place. When Gateway files bankruptcy this year, remember 
I told ya so. Yesterday, when Apple's 'bad' news quarterly came out, 
all the PC Industry stocks and most of the biggest companies in the 
country also tanked. Check the volume of sales AND the ups and downs 
of the market prices. When people sell on 'the news' you're seeing 
the 'little people' doing what they do best: Selling and buying in 
reaction to the news.

&gt;<i>It must be very frustrating to Jobs, et al., to find that Apple's 
</I>&gt;<i>market share has been literally cut in half within a relatively 
</I>&gt;<i>short period of time.
</I>
With the swing towards open source, the 'predictable' backlash 
against MS, around the World, you know, where the dummies haven't 
learned how to be good victims of monopolies, I'll bet Mr. Jobs is 
sleeping a hell of a lot better than Carly Fiorina over at HP. Apple 
stock has out-performed HP's also, along with all but 2 or 3 of the 
rest of the industry.
