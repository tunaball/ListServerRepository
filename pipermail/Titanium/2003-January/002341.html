</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Falling behind what? The TiBook was pretty much the top of the line laptop.

</I>&gt;<i> The screen and case and a lot about the TiBook had been &quot;matched&quot; (a poor

So, they haven't &quot;fallen behind&quot;, they've just been &quot;caught up to&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And I doubt Apple is in that business of price cutting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apple cuts prices on products all the time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Prices of all electronics fall, it is the nature of the industry.. A firm
</I>&gt;<i> can either compete by lowering prices with the herd or bringing out fresh
</I>&gt;<i> models at the higher price points. Apple likes the higher margins of fresh
</I>&gt;<i> models.  Yes, Apple cuts prices all the time..
</I>
I'm sorry...I'm confused...first you say that Apple doesn't cut prices and
now you say they do....

&gt;<i> But only when absolutely forced to by the market.
</I>
LOL *No* capitalist cuts prices unless forced to.

&gt;<i> I think that Apple is still way behind on processors.  I know the Mac
</I>&gt;<i> faithful will go nuts when they read this but Intel has kicked Motos ass.
</I>
Big deal.

Mac users have to stop &quot;looking over the fence&quot; at the other guy's lawn
mower.

I can do all the work I need to do on the machines that Apple has presently.
I believe that I can still do the work I need to do on the machines Apple
has in the pipeline.

It's not just about raw speed. It's about a comfort level, an OS that's easy
and fun to use and being part of a company and a community that I enjoy.

If what you need is raw speed, go buy a Cray.

&gt;<i> Oh, yea, while I am pushing all the buttons of the cult.. Steve is NOT worth
</I>&gt;<i> that $400 million he got last year.. NO ONE is worth that.
</I>
That's good. Cause all he got last year was a buck. All those options don't
mean squat until Jobs cashes them in. And he has said he *won't* cash them
in.
