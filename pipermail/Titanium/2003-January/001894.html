&gt;<i>Where do you live that the entire Classified section is filled with jobs for
</I>&gt;<i>Graphic Designers???!!! Hehehe.. Sounds like some kind of creative's utopia
</I>&gt;<i>or something.  ;-)
</I>
One of the most recent &quot;designer&quot; job ads I saw also want you to be a 
server/network/programming/and printshop geek as well as a web designer. 
IF they can find someone who knows that many aspects of the business in 
that capacity, good luck. Otherwise, there are 4 or 5 jobs there just in 
that one description.

Eastern US is a Mac &quot;mecca&quot;. Apple &quot;owns&quot; NYC. Boston is good too, and 
MOST schools around here use Macs, some are still using really old models 
that have lasted so well, it's ironically NOT helped the market share 
problem!

There are also lots of ads for graphic design schools, and in those ads I 
see LOTS of new Macs...there is one state school that offers their design 
program only on PC, but lots of those folks drive 60 miles at night to 
come to the U near me because it gives them the choice of Macs. 

One of my former students (when I was teaching plain old visual arts) 
told me he got into the computer design  field thanks to me, even though 
computers were not &quot;invented&quot; or used for that by individuals at that 
time. He said he gravitated toward it because of his interest in my art 
classes. He told me this when he came in to conference with me about his 
own kid, who was in my class at the time. (Yeah, don't that just make ya 
feel old!)

I just don't see how the design field will ever go away....web or print.
