Apple doesn't keep loads of built units or components on hand, that is for sure. The 15.2&quot; 1GHz TiBook was released when it was because it was in development earlier, used parts that were available at the time of the release, and allowed Apple to put out a killer machine before Christmas. It was also destined to be the final and most polished revision of the TiBook form factor. In addition, it assumes the role and realizes the number of advantages in keeping one model that boots into OS 9; and it makes most sense to make that model the one that came out in November. This way Apple keeps such a model in the lineup for a few more months while not forcing Steve to renege on his announcement that all models released after Jan. 1, 2003 would no longer boot in OS 9. In this case the model happens to be a great performer with arguably the best all-round balance of features. You may not care about booting into OS 9, but there are many folks out there who require it or want it, if onl
y for a little longer. In fact, a good number of people jumped on the 867MHz/1GHz model partly because they figured it would be the last TiBook to boot into OS 9 when needed.
