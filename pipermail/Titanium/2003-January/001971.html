 &gt;Chris,

&gt;<i>That's excellent advice for an advanced user who is comfortable with the
</I>&gt;<i>command line. Read the original post again. The person who asked the
</I>&gt;<i>question did not seem to be someone who would be comfortable in that
</I>&gt;<i>environment (as I'm sure 99% of OS X users are not). Most people using OS X
</I>&gt;<i>are looking for the path or least resistance and are not looking forward to
</I>&gt;<i>becoming a UNIX geek in order to run their Mac.
</I>
Yehaw! Someone gets it! (I think that was me you are referring to)
 
&gt;<i>I have invested a lot of time talking to a lot of people trying to convince
</I>&gt;<i>them that they don't need to understand UNIX to switch to/run OS X.  I stay
</I>&gt;<i>as far away from the Terminal as I can when it comes to advice for anyone
</I>&gt;<i>not comfortable with OS X's UNIX underpinnings.
</I>
We thank you for that!
 
&gt;<i>When you say, &quot;You can back up  to a Windows box, another Mac, a network
</I>&gt;<i>file server, or whatever, with  rsync over ssh: rsync -e 'ssh -i
</I>&gt;<i>/root/.ssh/&lt;public_key&gt;' -arvz --delete &lt;source&gt;  &lt;destination&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>also run from a cron job, with a public ssh key stored on the receiving
</I>&gt;<i>(backup) server to allow login without have to type a password at the
</I>&gt;<i>command line&quot;, the usual response is, &quot;What&quot;?
</I>
Exactly! Hello? Where do I begin, is what I think. I just want to know 
the first step and WHY I am doing it, otherwise I won't rememer HOW. None 
of my crowd needs SSH, believe me. I just want to know how to keep the 
thing going, and how to fix it fast and easy when it croaks. What is the 
reason behind what I do during the install...just like I know for OS 9 
the necessary steps to a good new system.
 
&gt;<i>I'm quite sure you are very, very good at what you do and your obvious
</I>&gt;<i>knowledge of the UNIX underpinnings of OS X is impressive, but you do this
</I>&gt;<i>marvelous OS and platform a disservice when you don't try to exhaust all the
</I>&gt;<i>avenues of familiarity first. For every person who understands your advice,
</I>&gt;<i>there are a thousand who don't. It's those thousand I want to convert to
</I>&gt;<i>and/or keep in OS X, and please believe me, UNIX speak does not make  it
</I>&gt;<i>easier. Over time, most OS X users will become more comfortable with UNIX,
</I>&gt;<i>but the vast majority don't want to start there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Just my 2&#162;.
</I>
Your 2 cents is worth a lot because you have hit the nail on the head. 
It's nice to know we can pry open these UNIX-Heads' brains and ask these 
questions, but, they should please use the K.I.S.S. principle for this 
dummy and for the &quot;rest of us&quot; who are too old and will never have the 
time to understand UNIX.
