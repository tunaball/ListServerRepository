</I>&gt;<i> Falling behind what? The TiBook was pretty much the top of the line laptop.

The screen and case and a lot about the TiBook had been &quot;matched&quot; (a poor
word, but in the mind of many Windoids it applies) by a number of other
machines.  Apples strategy is having something demonstrably better.  The new
Porsche design machine in particular was challenging the TiBooks claim to
coolest notebook and Sony had some pretty nice stuff as well.. So it was
time for Apple to &quot;knock 'em dead' with something like the new PowerBooks.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We decided if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there were no new PowerBooks that there had to be pretty substantial price
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cuts on the existing ones.  And I doubt Apple is in that business of price
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cutting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple cuts prices on products all the time.
</I>
Prices of all electronics fall, it is the nature of the industry.. A firm
can either compete by lowering prices with the herd or bringing out fresh
models at the higher price points. Apple likes the higher margins of fresh
models.  Yes, Apple cuts prices all the time.. But only when absolutely
forced to by the market.

I think that Apple is still way behind on processors.  I know the Mac
faithful will go nuts when they read this but Intel has kicked Motos ass.
Rubensteins group has done  an amazing job of making the pokey Motos shine,
but they are really not up to the same design standards as Apples hardware.

We need a G5 chip from another vendor that can manage to get the clock speed
up.  I have given up on Moto ever doing it because they do not really care
about it.

Oh, yea, while I am pushing all the buttons of the cult.. Steve is NOT worth
that $400 million he got last year.. NO ONE is worth that.
