<PRE>
Daer Ti-List members:

A friend of mine has asked me if it is possible to do this: on a 
regular basis, he wants to record a meeting (which could be taking 
place in many locations throughout Europe), using 2 video cameras to 
as well as a separate audio channel; he wants to know if he can use a 
Ti-book to &quot;mix&quot; these inputs, and transmit the mixed audio/visual 
signal to a server (via Airport?) as a web-cast.

I said this is beyond my knowledge and experience, BUT I know a group 
of people (you, the Ti-list) who between you probably know the 
answer......

My first response to him was that he would need something else ( 
&quot;mixing desk&quot;?), to handle the 3 incoming signals.    I expected that 
this mixing desk would connect to the Firewire port, and that there 
would be appropriate softyware to handle all these signals and output 
them for video-streaming to the server.

This could be quite an impressive task for a Ti-book to fulfill.  I 
guess it would need a fast Ti-book.

Can it be done ?    Has anyone on the List done it?
Any specific hardware and software recommendations or experiences 
that I could pass on ?
Any URL that I should check out?

Your contributions and ideas will be gratefully received.

regards,  Trevor
