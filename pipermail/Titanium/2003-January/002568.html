Dear Massimo,

That's truly wonderful that your institution is moving in the right
direction, but in the life sciences, things are moving in the other
direction. At UMDNJ - only a few G3s are at the Academic Computing Center.
All departments have Wintels...with a sprinkling of Macs in folks' labs
who can afford to buy their own (grants etc).

Same in other institutions I'm/have been affiliated with .
Even Bruce Giles,  one of the mac-l listmoms, reported about a year or 2 ago that his
institution (Oak Ridge?) had switched to wintels and was no longer
supporting Macs...

I'll have to surmise that you are a lucky fellow - great workplace with a
great attitude and tolerance. Same planet...yes...but privileged
neighborhood for you...

Best,

Henry
