<PRE>Thanks Robert,

I am a firm believer that ANY - ANY extended warranty options are a rip-off.
They are mostly designed to cover a sellers/manufacturers butt for not
seeing beyond the $, or to pad the sale for a better commission. Others may
disagree?

The last Sony TV I bought is a perfect example.. The salesman tried to sell
me an extended warranty which included an extra year plus at-home servicing.
I firmly said no - in 15 years I haven't had a single bad unit yet, plus I
believe most electronic components will break within a very short time of
turning on if anything. Well the TV Tube went wonky in about a month.. Was
dreading carting the 32&quot; beast into the shop, called Sony.. Surprise - ANY
Sony TV over 27&quot; COMES WITH a 2 yr/home service warranty. New TV for me :-)

Originally Apple iPod's came out with a 90 day warranty and people went
nuts.. That got bumped to a year in no time.. Amazing what consumers can
accomplish when they scream loud enough. Lucky/Unlucky for me I purchased
mine before the extension and also purchased an extended 3 years on my 10g
iPod - so we'll see what happens there!

This case is about the only other situation I have ever come across where
the need just seems so high.. No knock on Apple, it's a portable device so
it doesn't surprise me.

I think Paula hit the nail on the head - works out to about CDN$25/mo for
insurance coverage.. Can't get any simpler than that.
