<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; There is a very good reason not to buy anything from Apple (regardless of what
</I>&gt;<i> they tell you, and what, are they going to leak to *you* alone that there will
</I>&gt;<i> be a new Powerbook?) right before a Macworld. A thousand people here on this
</I>&gt;<i> list alone could have told you this.
</I>[snip]
&gt;<i> Sorry buddy but nobody predicted this! Everyone was predicting bit things
</I>&gt;<i> coming for the iMacs, iBooks and PowerMacs. Since the last release from
</I>&gt;<i> Apple were the new Powerbooks, they completely blindsided everybody.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Get over it? Sure I'll get over it. Dell, here I come!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I have the same sentiments.  I am a switcher from Unix &lt; 14 days.  I
have never had a Mac before.  So knowing that Macworld is some harbinger
of new stuff, sorry, I would never have known, I joined this list last
week.

Yes I am happy with my Tibook, it is beautiful, but given the choice,
and the timing, 500$ for a bigger display and advanced ports (USB2 and
Firewire), it is a no brainer.  I am 6ft and 1.5lbs makes no difference
to me on the plan.  It was not the Titanium that I bought it was the
hardware, the shell quite frankly does not sell it for me, but the OS
did.

As a long time Unix and PC user, the discovery/release dates are not
nearly as closely guarded.  I merely voiced my disappointment, I did not
saturate the list, curse, or moan, just said I was disappointed which is
not unreasonable.

To tell people to get over it or stop whining is a bit harsh and I think
undeserved.  Had you spent a better part of 3000K (which unfortunately I
am not equipped to do again for some time) less than 2 weeks ago you
might have felt the same.  It is just a bitter pill to swallow.  I am
smarter and better for the experience.

Sincerely,

Aaron
