No _I_ said it. I thought it was obvious that I was poking a little fun 
at you ;o) What you described in your 'cynical view' was an absolutely 
normal way to sell stuff. If you want to increase sales, you tart up 
the product a bit... like give it a 'speed bump.'

Naturally they want to sell as many as they can. Naturally they don't 
want unused materials around. Apple has done nothing wrong here.

Your TiBook, right now is the best laptop in existence. The 17 inch 
doesn't exist yet. Even when it does, you will have the best 15 inch. 
Nothing wrong there.

_If_ they discontinue the 15 inch (and nobody has said they will) the 
one gig version will have been in production at least as long as any of 
the other rev's and the overall form factor will have been in 
production longer than any other PowerBook. Nothing wrong there.

Last year I wanted a TiBook. I waited till after MWSF to see what would 
be announced, then I waited until after Tokyo. Then I waited a little 
longer and I ordered my 667. Two weeks after I got it, they brought out 
the 800. So what?

Apple has announced a new product. Whenever a new product is announced 
people will be taken by surprise. It's inevitable. Also, some people 
will have purchased the previous product just before the new one is 
announced. Also inevitable. It happens all the time with any rapidly 
changing product line. The only thing that's wrong here is your need to 
try to portray yourself as some kind of victim.

It isn't true. You aren't a victim.

You are an intelligent, discerning purchaser and you've got the best 
laptop money can buy.

Relax and enjoy it.

All the best,
Tom
