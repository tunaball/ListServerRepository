<PRE>I have been successful at blunting the &quot;Windows world&quot; retoric at the 
college where I teach, but using the diversity argument.  Education is 
very big on diversity, right?  I turn that back on the PC crowd -- pun 
intended.  We typically use that term in reference to ethnicity, 
culture, philosophy, etc.  Why not computer technologies?  Students 
should be exposed to more than Windows.  Isn't it important that they 
have a Macintosh experience, as well?  How about unix?  Sure, bring it 
all on ...anything that will reduce Windows dominance.  Open and diverse 
technology, where all concepts have equal opportunity, is good.  It's 
the best argument I've found so far for supporting and using Macs in a 
Windows world.

I teach graphic design.  My classroom has 20 late-model Macs and 10 
equivalent PCs.  A second facility is provided for students in the 
degree to use in assignments.  (This facility is separate from the 
general computer &quot;labs&quot; around campus, because of the expensive graphics 
software required in the program.)

Many students use whatever computer is available.  Some consciously 
switch back and forth to get more experience with cross-platform issues. 
Some feel put upon to use Macs.  When those bigoted students complain 
about having to use Macs (because there aren't enough PCs), I give them 
the &quot;lecture&quot; about diversity.  I tell them that this is their Mac 
experience and it will help make their education more well-rounded.  I 
also make the point that Macs are the dominant platform in the graphics 
field.  Sometime, somewhere, someday -- if they're going to be involved 
in the graphics industry as a career -- no matter how hard they try to 
avoid it, they will find themselves in a situation where they will have 
to use a Mac.  That quiets all but the most un-reconstructed PC user.
