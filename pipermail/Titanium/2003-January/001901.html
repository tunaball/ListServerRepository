</I>&gt;<i>Apple HAS to work on being competitive and increasing it's market share

Hi Henry,

Although I agree that one needs to remain 'rational' when looking at 
the situation, its implications, etc. Don't forget that with 
VirtualPC I can run any Windows program in existence. Also, an 
enormous number of 'widows-only' apps, are little arcane Lumber yard 
Specific accounting apps, and such, hardly big category 'killers'.

Apple, being connected, operationally, with OpenSource, and having 
the ability, for many years to read and work with diverse 
p'proprietary' file formats [made by MS to isolate ITS OWN CLIENT BAE 
from their 'legacy' in their windows environment], is clearly a 
superior OS when it comes to dealing with diverse systems, files, and 
needs of most users.

It isn't about 'cutting edge' tech, and that's a good thing, because 
MS would be in deep ____ if that were the case. Everyone from the 
security-conscious US Army, on down to the little 'nobodies', like 
myself, knows what a threat MS is to security. I side with the Army 
on this one, Microsoft is not to be trusted. You recall the huge 
shortage of iMacs at one point, brought about by the Army decision to 
transfer to a Mac-based frontend for their civilian workforce.

The overwhelming majority of Windows home users are not pushing the 
envelope with their usage of computers. Companies were misled into 
installing these huge, and more expensive, over the long haul, 
systems, and even though here in the States where monopoly is 
rewarded, Windows could look like the only game n town, bear in mind 
that the US is actually a small segment of the worldwide market, as a 
whole. A glance at the alarms being raised in government and industry 
all across Europe and Asia, should be enough to keep Gates up biting 
his nails.

Apple is obviously, with the XServers, and OpenSource, and Unix/Aqua 
tech, moving towards an increase in 'market share'. IBM and Sun 
aren't sitting on their arses either. An Apple/Sun/IBM, and say, AMD 
and Toshiba 'alliance', in concert with the OpenSource 'movement', 
could change the nature of the ballgame, dramatically. We're in the 
early innings, my friend, perhaps the 'top of the second', i wouldn't 
be conceding anything like defeat, at this point. There's a 
tremendous 'herd mentality' out there, it'll take time to turn it 
around. Somewhat like making a U-turn in an oil tanker, it doesn't 
happen 'on a dime'.
