I didn't say that YOU said it - it was in your post - and I was relating
to its contents.
 
&gt;<i> Second, everyone is lamenting about this 2.3% number with no

</I>&gt;<i> from wholesalers? Does it include Apple Store (online and 
</I>&gt;<i> brick/mortar)?  IDC's numbers have traditionally been bogus and

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will state it again: market share is near-meaningless statistic 
</I>&gt;<i> except to Marketing execs who need something to benchmark their 
</I>&gt;<i> bonuses... and bored reporters who need to continually attack Apple.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple is selling BILLIONS of dollars worth of computers every year, 
</I>&gt;<i> the number of computers sold is increasing, and more importantly the 
</I>&gt;<i> number of hardware and software developers is growing by leaps and 
</I>&gt;<i> bounds.  The rest is all hype.
</I>
Now, you DID say the above, right?

Mind giving us the credible source for this? I also fail to see the
numbers there. So, if it's NOT 2.3% (down from 5%) - then what is it?

Let's stop deluding ourselves! Apple needs to do &quot;something(s)&quot; and soon
to become a compatible and mainstream computer platform. All the talk
about &quot;Alfa Romeos and Porches&quot; is merely flawed analogies! Apple needs
this change to survive and be a relevant computer NOT just in the eyes of
its dedicated followers but for the general computer using population.

Best,

Henry
