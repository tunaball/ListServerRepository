Let's stop deluding ourselves! Apple needs to do &quot;something(s)&quot; and soon

about &quot;Alfa Romeos and Porches&quot; is merely flawed analogies! Apple needs
this change to survive and be a relevant computer NOT just in the eyes 
of
its dedicated followers but for the general computer using population.

Folks...PLEASE...Apple needs to work on an OS that can take ANY Windoze
application and run it just as good or BETTER on the Mac OS (like being
able to play the same record on a superior HI FI...or whatever 
appropriate
analogy you care for) so that PC users (NOT you, the converted!!!) will
say&quot; Hey! NEAT...I might as well get a Mac and run all my applications 
and
then some on it&quot;. An increase in market share is not just GOOD, it's a
MUST for Apple to survive. STOP deluding yourselves... TY for listening.

Apple already is a compatible and mainstream computer platform, and a 
Mac can hook up to a pc no problem, I do it all the time. Others use 
Virtual pc with no problems. The Porsche and Alfa Romeo analogies are 
basically saying that those cars are expensive and make up a small 
segment of the total car population just like Apple, which is true. As 
for relevance, Apple computers were relevant even before Bill Gates 
copied them.

The &quot;play the same record on a superior HI FI&quot; analogy is flawed 
because the turntables &quot;agree&quot; that the vinyl record is the best media 
for that device. When you said...

&quot;Apple needs to work on an OS that can take ANY Windoze
application and run it just as good or BETTER on the Mac OS&quot;

Any pc software must be rewritten to work on a Mac you can't load an XP 
program into OS X and expect it to load. If you are saying that 
software companies need to write their software for all major 
platforms, I agree. If you are talking about a built in pc emulator in 
the OS, what's the point? they already work together, and there's 
virtual pc.

Also I disagree with your statement...
&quot;An increase in market share is not just GOOD, it's a
MUST for Apple to survive. STOP deluding yourselves... TY for 
listening.&quot;

Money is what's needed for Apple to survive, that and the desire to 
survive, who cares about market share when you have a superior product.
