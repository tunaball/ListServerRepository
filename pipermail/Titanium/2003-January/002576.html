<PRE>I have been having some serious slow downs with iMovie on my PB 800,  
and rather than doing some sleuthing, thought I would wait until iMovie  
was released this weekend.

But all the Mac press now states it will be the following weekend, some  
suggesting it is due to changes in hardware...such as this one:

begin&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;iLife delayed until Jan. 31; hardware upgrades at fault
By Nick dePlume , Publisher and Editor in Chief

January 23, 2003 - Sources confirmed today that the sale of Apple's  
iLife software package has been delayed from January 25, this weekend,  
until January 31. However, the date was backed up not as the result of  
any software issue, but rather to correspond with the release of new  
hardware speed bumps.

Apple did not provide a reason for the delay, but Think Secret sources  
have confirmed that iLife discs have been burned and many of Apple's  
retail locations are already sitting on boxes of the bundle, ready to  
sell. A call to some Apple retail stores found no stock of iLife discs,  
but while the sale has been delayed, the shipments clearly have not, to  
some stores.

In fact, the delay has nothing to do with iLife itself or its  
applications, but rather the forthcoming upgrades to iMacs and other  
hardware, sources said. iLife has been delayed to correspond with the  
release of the new hardware, upon which the iLife applications will be  
pre-installed.

The new models will tentatively be announced the following week,  
possibly on Monday, February 3. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;end





The question is: Can you really trust someone who splits infinitives as  
badly as Nick de Plume?!
