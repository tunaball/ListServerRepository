<PRE>&lt;Titanium 667 / 1 GB RAM / OS 10.2.3&gt;

I spent hours yesterday, and last night, trying to 'fix' Suitcase 10.2

It has been completely trashed and freshly re-installed several times.

I finally loaded it into my OS 9 partition, and when either booted 
into OS 9, or logged in as 'root' it launches. [both manually and as 
a 'Login Item].

I rebuilt the Directory using DiskWarrior, ran Disk First Aid, tossed 
the GlobalPreferences, and ran Repair Privileges. It still will not 
launch, when I'm in my own account. It still launches instantaneously 
when in OS 9, or logged-in as 'root'.

Even with my entire Preferences folder [OSX] in the Trash, same 
story, launches everywhere except from my normal User account.

Although I use it primarily in OS 9, and sometimes [if i work on a 
document in Quark, in 'Classic' emulation mode], I am puzzled. I'd 
say I'm at my wit's end, but I'm still able to read and type.

Suitcase has worked flawlessly for me for a long time. The only real 
difference in my setup is that I re-installed Final Cut Pro 3. And, 
as usual, all of my plugins, or shared library files [that have ????, 
or 'unknown' Creator codes] have taken on the physical [icon] 
appearance of Final Cut Pro 'shlb's or plugs. This has always 
happened on my Ti-Book, under numerous OS installs, etc. And, if 
Final Cut isn't onboard, the same will occur with Bryce, or Spark, or 
any of a number of other big apps, and their effect on unknown 
Creator-code icons. The performance of the various apps isn't 
affected, however, and being that Suitcase only writes 2 sets of 
prefs, one to the OS 9 and one to the ~/Library/prefs  directory, it 
seems that 'Prefs' aren't the problem, anyway, as Suitcase launches 
everywhere but from my own working account...

Does anyone have a suggestion here? Thanks for anything.
