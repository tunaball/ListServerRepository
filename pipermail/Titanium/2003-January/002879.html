</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, you're announcing on a public mailing list that bootleg copies of Apple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software are available?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Brilliant. &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Copyright theft sucks.  Nothing destroys the future of the Apple platform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> faster than people who rip off software.  Demo a product, sure.  But to rip
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it off peer to peer is outright theft.  Why would any developer want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> invest R &amp; D into a product for Macintosh when the users themselves support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this kind of theft on line for God's sakes?  Shawn King is being kind with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> his sarcastic &quot;Brilliant&quot; comment.  People who steal ruin it for everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> else.  They are nothing more than common thieves.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MBurke
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since we are playing make believe, I'll play too:)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *Scenario #1
</I>&gt;<i> I buy a car in January from Fyord Moto Company. It has no wheels, radio or
</I>&gt;<i> windows. In Feb they release a new model, with wheels. I have to sell my old
</I>&gt;<i> January car-but no-one wants it. In March they come out with Windows. I sell
</I>&gt;<i> again for pennies on the dollar. By December I have purchased 12 cars, but
</I>&gt;<i> finally have all the options that all the other cars have-until next January
</I>&gt;<i> that is. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That isn't very nice either. What about the public losing 50% of their 401K
</I>&gt;<i> due to software R&amp;D hype and propaganda, losing $BILLIONS of dollars for
</I>&gt;<i> folks who trust what was supposed to be an admirable system? I suppose the
</I>&gt;<i> knee jerk argument would be that copyright infringers have created all that
</I>&gt;<i> loss; but by admitting that you admit they also caused all the positive
</I>&gt;<i> things that occur too, because this capitalistic system feeds off of each
</I>&gt;<i> others activities like yin and yang. Those appearing positive secretly need
</I>&gt;<i> that darkness to complete it's endless cycle, and to keep that wheel
</I>&gt;<i> turning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *Scenario #2
</I>&gt;<i> 1992-1996 Not one single person ever ever borrowed or checked out
</I>&gt;<i> unauthorized software. All software remained at 1992 prices because of no
</I>&gt;<i> competition. Not one single hack occurred.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Demand would have remained non-existent because needs were non-existent. Not
</I>&gt;<i> one MP3, or .NET app, or .png would be invented because the uncontrollable
</I>&gt;<i> rain of knowledge had not fallen from the skies to all the consumers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The internet would be nothing and the innocent software companies would not
</I>&gt;<i> even exist today if only the paying internet user at that time accounted for
</I>&gt;<i> only about 20% of the (single user)explosion; ultimately it was the 80% army
</I>&gt;<i> of uncontrollable geeks which attracted the investors and competition in the
</I>&gt;<i> first place to the Information Superhighway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So called criminals and raw porn (uncontrolled by the media) built the 'net
</I>&gt;<i> that the copyright holders embrace, just like criminals and prostitutes
</I>&gt;<i> dominated the Western US in 1860-1880. Apple abhors prostitution, but
</I>&gt;<i> boy-howdy it collects the rent from the cathouse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If anything, Microsoft became the giant due to more than one reason.
</I>&gt;<i> Business alliances of course, but also the serial number availability to all
</I>&gt;<i> to get on the 'net and push R&amp;D to it's limits through uncontrolled and
</I>&gt;<i> chaotic competition. Also known as stimulation, or foreplay in some circles.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Software could be free if no money is being made from it, or if nobody makes
</I>&gt;<i> money from you having it, because it is not a tangible product.
</I>&gt;<i> And free exposure is king: Yahoo gave out millions of free accounts, secured
</I>&gt;<i> a base, then charged them all. Happens allot lately. Got .mac?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft became popular because the product was out there, it was
</I>&gt;<i> available, it was free to put on all kinds of equipment, it produced users
</I>&gt;<i> and fans. In say, oh, 1994, Apple was expensive, protected, secret and
</I>&gt;<i> unavailable to those pioneers, who's dastardly activity fueled the opening
</I>&gt;<i> of virtual investors wallets, and the numbers prove what happened in the
</I>&gt;<i> end. Apple almost got sacked.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile, in those early ISH years, every brainless MS user was aware of
</I>&gt;<i> their favorite product, who had there teeth into it via unauthorized
</I>&gt;<i> exposure, and due to un-enforced so-called illegal access, became
</I>&gt;<i> knowledgeable about the product. Apple? Uhm, the masses passed, the masses
</I>&gt;<i> rule the market by sheer volume. Meanwhile, MS spawned products
</I>&gt;<i> exponentially.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *Scenario 3:
</I>&gt;<i> My car was stolen a few years back. It was a 69 Mustang. It's tranny went
</I>&gt;<i> out. The cop arrived. He called a wrecker. I gave the wrecker driver my Amex
</I>&gt;<i> and keys.
</I>&gt;<i> He towed it off to an address. I went home.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Next day we go to get the car. Well, the wrecker hauled it off somewhere and
</I>&gt;<i> it was gone forever. I called the copper. Guess what: MY PROBLEM. The
</I>&gt;<i> official reason was I authorized it when I left the keys with him (Even
</I>&gt;<i> though it was un drivable). The cop said I willingly offered the keys. I
</I>&gt;<i> freaked, he looked for the wrecker, but never found it, and never
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledged theft.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if I own a car, and it's legal to steal it if keys are left in it, and
</I>&gt;<i> no forced access was proved--it should be the same for software used for
</I>&gt;<i> observation that finds it's way by itself on my machine via spam or some P2P
</I>&gt;<i> program left turned on. But it isn't stealing-it's &quot;unauthorized use&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;viewing confidential data&quot;. But if you can't lock it up, tough titty, just
</I>&gt;<i> like my 'stang.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *Scenario #4
</I>&gt;<i> Thievery: See: IRS, IMF, Federal Reserve, DOD, DOT, DARE, real estate
</I>&gt;<i> developers, Blockbuster, SWAT, city government, Mexico (illegal aliens
</I>&gt;<i> sending home $US dollars account for 40% of Mexico's GNP), trash collection,
</I>&gt;<i> an employee sending unauthorized email and using valuable company resources,
</I>&gt;<i> cloud seeding programs who fnckiu' steal my pretty blue skies, etc, etc,
</I>&gt;<i> etc, ........
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If a hacker gets life for changing his grade in Chemistry, then our leaders
</I>&gt;<i> should get called on for stealing our liberties.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just playing devils advocate here, so don't call me a thief. I even paid for
</I>&gt;<i> my crappy Fetch program, and if anything should be hacked that crappy
</I>&gt;<i> program should have been.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To simply cry &quot;thief, thief!&quot; is also simplifying the problem so that no
</I>&gt;<i> solution can be devised. People who scream &quot;It's illegal illegal illegal put
</I>&gt;<i> 'em in jail!&quot; are those who will not attend my problem solver meetings, they
</I>&gt;<i> have a closed and limited attitude toward resolving a complex problem that
</I>&gt;<i> exists whether we like it or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can also be sure that in the end we will all be fully controlled and
</I>&gt;<i> monitored electronically, so you may as well enjoy the crazy wild west
</I>&gt;<i> freedom we have now. We still sorta live is a free world, and within a
</I>&gt;<i> generation we will be in the Matrix, and salon workers will know the serial
</I>&gt;<i> number to access your butt hair color, and then many will feel secure. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>Great points Loren!

But you guys should just move along from the bickering..
We don't really need to be throwing around the big bad P word, we all say
things we don't really mean from time to time don't we???

Crack open the Software Update and download it for yourself.
Only 84.5MB for iMovie 3.0.1 and 33.3 MB for iPhoto 2.0

Thank god I am on High Speed ADSL..
