So, what do you propose? IOW, how could Apple build its market share in 
order to entice software companies into developing for them? I think 
that Apple has made a good move by releasing its own software and 
making a push to further integrate its software and hardware, BUT- I 
don't think it does much for enticing converts from PC land. I can't 
think of anything I did on a PC that hasn't been easier on a Macintosh- 
and I've done things from word-processing to producing feature-length 
motion pictures. (BTW, do yourselves a favor and don't bother trying to 
edit a film on a PC- that was the last time I truly cried hard.)

So, from a (somewhat) recent switcher's perspective: if the day-to-day 
tasks of personal computing are easier on a Macintosh than they are on 
a PC (a judgement call, of course), what is KEEPING Apple from 
increasing market share? Is it unattractive to most PC people since the 
tasks most often performed by home PC users (email, web-surfing, etc) 
are mostly utilitarian, and not necessarily emotionally tied (read: 
Ford Taurus)? Perhaps if Apple wants to increase market share, a 
Utilimac is in order- something somewhat stylish, with some powerful 
features- that retails for about $500?

IMHO, if Apple can be profitable with the lines of computers they have 
(i, Ti, Al and e), I find it unnecessary to succumb to some Ghost-World 
style &quot;Grow-or-die&quot; mentality and produce boring web-surfing boxes to 
fickle consumers who won't necessarily hang around if they find a 
cheaper Gateway.

In short: Consumers are fleeting, but your customers are your true 
market share.
