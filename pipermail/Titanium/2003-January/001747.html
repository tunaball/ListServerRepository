<PRE>&gt;<i>5). Except for the 2X verses 1X SuperDrive, and maybe a slightly faster
</I>&gt;<i>video card (no relative speed tests yet available), the 1 GHz 17&quot; is no
</I>&gt;<i>faster than my 1 GHz 15&quot;.
</I>
Chris,

While the tests were done on dark side hardware and the reviews over-emphasized game (3D) performance, last autumn the &quot;Mobility Radeon 9000&quot; both outpaced and consumed less power than the &quot;GeForce4 440 Go&quot; that's in the new 17&quot; model.

A friend ran benchmark tests on a 17&quot; PB at MWSF and found the results to be between 5% - 10% faster than the 15.2&quot; 1GHz TiBook. No big deal. That's mostly due to the faster system bus speed as the implementation of DDR memory gains almost nothing with the current CPU and circuit design.

&gt;<i>My only fear is that they abandon the 15&quot; form factor sometime
</I>&gt;<i>down the road because for me it is the PERFECT form factor.
</I>
I think we should start to expect more frequent updates from Apple, and that the 15.2&quot; form factor will be with us for some time yet. Sticking my neck out, I'd venture the next revision of the 15.2&quot; Ti(AL?)Book will appear about May or June and will leap-frog the now similar performance of the new 17&quot; model. Most buyers of the 17&quot; model won't take delivery until March, so that ought to give them a couple of months to have fun before we see the faster next generation 15.2&quot; that employs 0.13 micron technology, better implementation of DDR, the same or revised versions of the illuminated keyboard, BlueTooth, AirPort Extreme, etc. It's very possible the 17&quot; model will be updated at the same time, leaving a number of purchasers cranky over having just received their spiffy new 17&quot; machines weeks or months before. That's also 5 to 6 months after the 17&quot; would have been announced, something that should stifle at least a few would-be whiners; and it allows Apple to keep a machine in 
the lineup that will boot from OS 9 for a few more months. Hopefully this is the year of rapid development and most everyone will learn to embrace it. Note: A new advance and release does not render a recently purchased PowerBook obsolete!

P.S. Hope you've been enjoying your GigaBook. I've been thinking about you, as bad a correspondent as I can be at times.
