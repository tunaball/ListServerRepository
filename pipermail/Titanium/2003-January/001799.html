Very well said, Ryan.

I forsee at lease 3-4 years' use out of my Ti G4 800 MHz Powerbook, with
perhaps a HD upgrade in the future from the current 40 GB HD to a 160 GB
HD, when those come out at a sufficiently low price, and maybe an increase
in the RAM to the Max (1 GB?).

Other than that - the Ti 800 is here to allow me to do work, and unless
something TOTALLY radical shows up on the scene - like a Ti G6 with 16 GB
RAM, a holographic screen, voice activated keyboardless input...I'll stick
with it  :-)))

And to all those who are obsessed with buying a new Ti etc the minute it
shows up - you probably are not using it for work, so just enjoy. The next
one should be coming out in about 2 months or so...lol

Best,

Henry
