</I>Rick, Robin, Bigley and everyone,

For Apple to survive it has to have a firm base. You're looking at things
from a Mac loyalist point of view, something like: &quot;If t'aint running on a
Mac - we don't need it&quot;. There are many applications which NON Mac users
use - just go to ANY computer store, and see what's available for the PC
and what's available for the Mac. If those programs could run on BOTH Mac
and PC - OTHER people might be tempted to go with a Mac. Programs are also
constantly being developed and will be developed in the future. If Apple's
market share and flexibility doesn't change - the temptation to write for
the PC market only will be a strong economic determinant.
The grave danger then would be that at a miniscule market share - Apple
would become a non-viable entity.


Now, if you all don't feel that more Mac users is a worthy and GOOD thing
for both Apple Computer AND US, then by all means - disparage the Windoze
crowd, and tell yourselves whatever it is that makes you feel good. BUT,
if you are truly invested in the Mac (and I am!!), then you'd be able to
take a critical look at things, feel blessed for what we have that is
better, and not fear to outline that which needs working on.

Best,

Henry
