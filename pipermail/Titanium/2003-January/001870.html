Hiya all,

I actually wrote all this in response to a private email (hence I've kept it anonymous for etiquette reasons), but I ended up getting on the soapbox and babbling on as usual.  So stuff it, why make one person suffer when I can get all of ya instead?

Welcome to Phil's Buying Psychology 101....  the carry on continues...

;-)

Personally, I would love to group BMW, Ferrari, Aston Martin, and Jaguar all together...in my own bloody garage (if I had one)!

Going to take my PowerBook to bed and go back to playing Solitaire now.

&gt;<i>I thought that your post had a good angle, and not too much b-s
</I>&gt;<i>Perhaps not too much new, but a good sumary of the specialist rather
</I>&gt;<i>than commodity sector
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I personally would not group BMW with Ferrari, from a market segment
</I>&gt;<i>point of view.
</I>&gt;<i>They are at different price points.   Ferrari is like Aston Martin,
</I>&gt;<i>BMW is like Jaguar, perhaps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway, not to start any argument, just to clarify.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Your point of a consistent small market share is the most valid.
</I>

Actually, when I am selling stuff here I don't even talk about BMWs or Ferraris, I talk about HSV Commodores (<A HREF="http://www.hsv.com.au">http://www.hsv.com.au</A>).  But they're only available in Australia here, so only a handful on the list would have understood.  I only use cars as an analogy because most people understand the difference between an exotic car and a basic transporter.  Whether a person buys a BMW, Ferrari, or HSV Commodore, he/she is purchasing something that in addition to its intended use, will also provide an emotional return as well, as opposed to a basic transport that only serves to perform a simple function that doesn't involve an emotional return.  In the same way that we all regard our Macs with some degree of passion and emotion.  What got me thinking about the HSV Commodore vs normal boring Commodore comparison was the TV advert a while ago where the bloke gets into the HSV, looks at the camera and says, &quot;I just want one&quot;.  It's an Australian thing, but most that see that commercial think, &quot;yeah, me to!&quot;  Presses the Aussie bloke's buttons quite well.  (Oh yeah... the upcoming Pontiac GTO is actually a Holden Commodore Monaro that we've been making here for a while).

My intention of all that analogy is to place the Mac product above the PC product, thus requiring a different buying psychology and attitude.  The underlying point of it all was about corporate identity, using, as examples, other companies with strong identities and market respect (ie BMW, Ferrari, Sony).  Thus, the buyer bases his purchasing decision on what the product does for him/her personally rather that solely what it costs.  The buyer *respects* the product.  Selling a product with a strong identity and high price is often easier than selling a product with no identity but a low price.  People will spend amazing amounts of money when it's an emotional purchase.  A prime example being what men spend on hair cuts, compared to what women spend at the same hairdresser.  Completely different attitudes result in completely different spending willingness.

Doesn't look like anyone got any of it anyway, one of the points was actually meant to be about convincing colleagues and associates that the Mac is viable, and at the same time, an elite (and affordable) option.  Everyone seems to be more than happy to bag Apple all time time instead of conveying to others in their business or social circles what the potential benefits of an Apple purchase are.  Dunno about you lot, but whenever I come across a Mac vs PC debate, I always manage to throw enough logic into the debate to convince a previously neutral person and make some good points for the Apple site.  But I've had plenty of practice at it.


Phil
Who spends 10 Aussie bucks a month on a simple clippers cut (ie $US5)...  worth every bloody cent, you should see the legs on the twenty-something mini skirt lady that does it!  The Australian word for it is, &quot;coooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!&quot;.  Was also pondering today how a HSV SS Group A sticker would look on the back of the trusty Suzuki van.
