<PRE>It appears that we have struck a considerable chord with this discussion yet few of us if any have made any positive contribution to the problem.  Now I know that is what the Apple Marketing Department is for.  But we can inspire them.  Right?  FYI, I do think Apple follows this list.  That said:

The only person who stepped up to the plate with insight and an action plan was, of all people, an attorney; people who are not normally known for their insight ... ;-) But Tim Naegel wrote:

I'm not the kind of person to sit around and watch the best platform in the history of computers go quietly into &quot;that night&quot;.  So let's kick some PC butt... LOL.  Beats bitching.  Here's a challenge to the list.  Each one of us should actively sell a unit to a current PC user.  Now that would affect the market share.  If you want to do it respond on the list under subject CHALLENGE.  Hell, it makes for a great marketing campaign alone doesn't it?  Think of the print media and TV that could be spun off this idea!   Fantastic!  It's liberating.  I started last night by talking a lifelong IBM user into considering a Mac for his next laptop.  I'm even walking him into the Apple store for a look see.  Let's kick up the jams people...Any other takers?
