Since we are playing make believe, I'll play too:)

*Scenario #1
I buy a car in January from Fyord Moto Company. It has no wheels, radio or
windows. In Feb they release a new model, with wheels. I have to sell my old
January car-but no-one wants it. In March they come out with Windows. I sell
again for pennies on the dollar. By December I have purchased 12 cars, but
finally have all the options that all the other cars have-until next January
that is. 

That isn't very nice either. What about the public losing 50% of their 401K
due to software R&amp;D hype and propaganda, losing $BILLIONS of dollars for
folks who trust what was supposed to be an admirable system? I suppose the
knee jerk argument would be that copyright infringers have created all that
loss; but by admitting that you admit they also caused all the positive
things that occur too, because this capitalistic system feeds off of each
others activities like yin and yang. Those appearing positive secretly need
that darkness to complete it's endless cycle, and to keep that wheel
turning.

*Scenario #2
1992-1996 Not one single person ever ever borrowed or checked out
unauthorized software. All software remained at 1992 prices because of no
competition. Not one single hack occurred.

Demand would have remained non-existent because needs were non-existent. Not
one MP3, or .NET app, or .png would be invented because the uncontrollable
rain of knowledge had not fallen from the skies to all the consumers.

The internet would be nothing and the innocent software companies would not
even exist today if only the paying internet user at that time accounted for
only about 20% of the (single user)explosion; ultimately it was the 80% army
of uncontrollable geeks which attracted the investors and competition in the
first place to the Information Superhighway.

So called criminals and raw porn (uncontrolled by the media) built the 'net
that the copyright holders embrace, just like criminals and prostitutes
dominated the Western US in 1860-1880. Apple abhors prostitution, but
boy-howdy it collects the rent from the cathouse.

If anything, Microsoft became the giant due to more than one reason.
Business alliances of course, but also the serial number availability to all
to get on the 'net and push R&amp;D to it's limits through uncontrolled and
chaotic competition. Also known as stimulation, or foreplay in some circles.

Software could be free if no money is being made from it, or if nobody makes
money from you having it, because it is not a tangible product.
And free exposure is king: Yahoo gave out millions of free accounts, secured
a base, then charged them all. Happens allot lately. Got .mac?

Microsoft became popular because the product was out there, it was
available, it was free to put on all kinds of equipment, it produced users
and fans. In say, oh, 1994, Apple was expensive, protected, secret and
unavailable to those pioneers, who's dastardly activity fueled the opening
of virtual investors wallets, and the numbers prove what happened in the
end. Apple almost got sacked.

Meanwhile, in those early ISH years, every brainless MS user was aware of
their favorite product, who had there teeth into it via unauthorized
exposure, and due to un-enforced so-called illegal access, became
knowledgeable about the product. Apple? Uhm, the masses passed, the masses
rule the market by sheer volume. Meanwhile, MS spawned products
exponentially.

*Scenario 3:
My car was stolen a few years back. It was a 69 Mustang. It's tranny went
out. The cop arrived. He called a wrecker. I gave the wrecker driver my Amex
and keys.
He towed it off to an address. I went home.

Next day we go to get the car. Well, the wrecker hauled it off somewhere and
it was gone forever. I called the copper. Guess what: MY PROBLEM. The
official reason was I authorized it when I left the keys with him (Even
though it was un drivable). The cop said I willingly offered the keys. I
freaked, he looked for the wrecker, but never found it, and never
acknowledged theft.

So, if I own a car, and it's legal to steal it if keys are left in it, and
no forced access was proved--it should be the same for software used for
observation that finds it's way by itself on my machine via spam or some P2P
program left turned on. But it isn't stealing-it's &quot;unauthorized use&quot; or
&quot;viewing confidential data&quot;. But if you can't lock it up, tough titty, just
like my 'stang.

*Scenario #4
Thievery: See: IRS, IMF, Federal Reserve, DOD, DOT, DARE, real estate
developers, Blockbuster, SWAT, city government, Mexico (illegal aliens
sending home $US dollars account for 40% of Mexico's GNP), trash collection,
an employee sending unauthorized email and using valuable company resources,
cloud seeding programs who fnckiu' steal my pretty blue skies, etc, etc,
etc, ........

If a hacker gets life for changing his grade in Chemistry, then our leaders
should get called on for stealing our liberties.

Just playing devils advocate here, so don't call me a thief. I even paid for
my crappy Fetch program, and if anything should be hacked that crappy
program should have been.

To simply cry &quot;thief, thief!&quot; is also simplifying the problem so that no
solution can be devised. People who scream &quot;It's illegal illegal illegal put
'em in jail!&quot; are those who will not attend my problem solver meetings, they
have a closed and limited attitude toward resolving a complex problem that
exists whether we like it or not.

You can also be sure that in the end we will all be fully controlled and
monitored electronically, so you may as well enjoy the crazy wild west
freedom we have now. We still sorta live is a free world, and within a
generation we will be in the Matrix, and salon workers will know the serial
number to access your butt hair color, and then many will feel secure. :-)
