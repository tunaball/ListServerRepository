<PRE>I think the trend of Apple developing a diversity of really good 
software is significant.  For many years, Apple's philosophy was that 
they would stay out of the software arena and support third-party 
developers.  It was a positive symbiotic relationship ...for the most 
part.  But things have changed.  I think Steve and his people have 
become frustrated by third party developers abandoning the Mac, yet 
there are &quot;insanely great&quot; opportunities for the right &quot;killer&quot; software 
...as Apple has demonstrated with FileMaker, Final Cut, etc.

A second aspect of this trend of Apple software is even more long-term. 
  Microsoft is profitable without hardware sales (...although that may 
not be completely accurate in the broader sense, because of their 
dominating influence in the market).  Rumors of MacOS X running on the 
PC-compatible platform have been circulating for years.  What if Apple 
were to release MacOS X for PCs?  That can only happen if Apple has 
sufficient non-hardware revenue streams.  The growing stable of software 
that Apple is developing (or acquiring) is possibly in support of that 
happening one day in the future.

My thoughts,
Ron Woodland
