Um...I actually am emphasizing that very point - that we CANNOT ignore the
rest of the world, and that we need to ensure that a greater share of it
will belong to the Mac. I never suggested otherwise...
 
&gt;<i> Your point about market share is flawed in that Apple's share IS 
</I>&gt;<i> growing (and it is a share of a market that is growing too) and with 
</I>&gt;<i> OSX, developers in the Unix/Linux world are often only a re-compile 
</I>&gt;<i> away from having a Mac version of their software... and to those 
</I>&gt;<i> folks that is a HUGE slice of pie.
</I>
5% (the &quot;top estimate&quot;) is NOT &quot;a HUGE slice of the pie&quot;. 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Combine that with the fact that Apple is GIVING AWAY its developer 
</I>&gt;<i> tools with every purchase of OSX and/or a new Mac, and you have what 
</I>&gt;<i> is happening today:  a dynamic movement to develop on the Macintosh.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Big companies that are not porting their software to Mac are finding 
</I>&gt;<i> applications, haxies or drivers being written by the open source 
</I>&gt;<i> community or Mac developers.  An excellent example of this is 
</I>&gt;<i> VueScan; it is a $40 piece of shareware that will allow most popular 
</I>&gt;<i> scanners to work with OSX, something the scanner manufacturers are 
</I>&gt;<i> far behind in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> An interesting litmus test of our theories will be Safari... based on 
</I>&gt;<i> Open Source, and getting lots of support in that community, let's 
</I>&gt;<i> look at this topic a year from now.  See what kind of web browsing 
</I>&gt;<i> experience will only be available in Mac or Linux (Apple is sharing 
</I>&gt;<i> all of it's development with the KDE community).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even TechTV (owned by Microsoftian Paul Allen) was all abuzz with 
</I>&gt;<i> MacWorld news. Why? Once reporter said it best: Everyone looks to 
</I>&gt;<i> these events because Apple is the innovator, and what you see here is 
</I>&gt;<i> usually what you will see on your PC in a year or two. (paraphrased).
</I>
What I want is for the PC crowd to say&quot; HEY! I can get the NEXT PC N O W,
and it'll run all my programs and then some, so that I lose NOTHING&quot;.
The true litmus test will be - how many NEW, NON-Mac users will buy the
Mac. How many companies will switch to using the Mac as the &quot;better value
computer - one that can do ALL that a PC does, run everything it can...and
THEN SOME!!&quot;. Why is that being &quot;chicken little&quot;? 


Best,

Henry
