<PRE>Hi.

On my two last portables, I've had various network port troubles...I 
was wondering if you've experienced anything like it, and how you 
resolved them?

1 ------
iBook 700 MHz, Combo
This network port suffers from very bad connection. The white plastic 
thing that makes up the actual suspension for the RJ45 connector is 
loose. If I just let go of the inserted connector, it tilts backwards 
and the connection is lost. If I put something below it (right next to 
the computer) to support it, there is the risk that the force is too 
great and the plastic suspension &quot;cracks&quot;  and gets out of place. To 
get it back, I need to use quite a lot of force. When it snaps back 
there is a significant &quot;click&quot;.

To get a good connection it is necessary to fiddle with the angle of 
the connector and hope that you find a position where the connection is 
OK.

2 ------
TiBook 1GHz, SD
On the TiBook, the problem is the reverse. Once I insert the connector, 
it is _stuck_. Even though I can (with some effort) fully push away the 
little plastic thing that is supposed hold the connector in place, I 
can't pull the connector out. It attaches to the port some other way. 
It is not connector specific, but applies to many types of RJ45's. I 
need to use a long small object like a knife to push away the plastic 
thing and at the same time pull the connector out. That works sometimes.

What can I do to solve this? For the iBook, I'm convinced that I need 
to replace the white plastic thing that holds the connector. It has 
always been pretty bad, but it has gotten worse. On the TiBook I'm 
hoping the port will &quot;wear out&quot; a bit so that what is stopping the 
connector from being released becomes less sharp.

/ Regards, David Remahl
