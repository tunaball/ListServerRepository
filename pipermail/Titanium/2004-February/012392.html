<PRE>&gt;<i>I don't get it? Why are so many people and websites so po'd at Apple for
</I>&gt;<i>this promotion? The UK website, The Register, blasted the promotion too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Personally, I think it's a great promotion. Am I in the minority?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think it has something to do with the restrictions on advertising 
in the UK.  From the comments sent to the register, the majority 
think that the kids were somehow &quot;harmed&quot; by all the &quot;negative&quot; 
attention that they are getting.  They see this big bad company 
exploiting children and even touting their guilt in front of millions 
of people.  Do they not think that these kids were compensated for 
being in the ad? Plus they think we are all slaves to advertising and 
that we'll all go out and buy tons of Pepsi and rot all our teeth 
away without thinking.

What they are missing is that we have brains in our heads.  We don't 
go out and buy products solely because we saw an ad on TV.  If we 
absolutely have to buy an iTune, we'll go directly to iTunes and buy 
it that way, not by going to the store and buying 3 Pepsi products.

Maybe they are just pissed that they can't buy iTunes this way, but 
they can't buy them via the Pepsi promotion either, so what's the 
point?

Peter
