Ha ha ha, development on GNOME and KDE would have stopped if Apple 
had the first 'real' user-friendly Unix out there in time. Who do you 
think has been 'switching' to Apple gear these last few years? 
Windows users? Guess again.

Linux is fragmented ( to many semi-incompatible libs/distros) and 
looks awful, unless you grew up on Windows 9x and NT. If Apple really 
wants to have it 'both ways', they could just as easily have 
continued a separate OS 9 style MacOS, for the diehards, and the 
developers who want a slice of that yummy 2% market share, and ported 
NeXTSTEP straight/no-chaser to higher-end Apple boxes.

They'd be laughing right now and they's have had an extra $6 Billion 
or so to further their &quot;we're gonna be Sony' 'roadmap'.

If mr jobs had decency as well as marketing 'brains' he'd license NS 
and Objective-C to someone with some hardcore computing savvy, and 
carry on with the 'lowest common denominator approach' to software 
and who and what it's 'for', as he is doing now. He'd have more 
money, the Maccies would have their schizo 'marriage' of NeXT and 
Legacy/HFS+ OS (aka MacOS), and the world would have an open spec, 
killer operating system, in wide use, that would rein in MS, and the 
other purveyors of crap.

Not sure what you consider 'the typical Mac user' to be. My scientist 
buddy at NASA Ames? All those folks with XServe 'farms' doing special 
effects? The publishing industry? (you know, 'content providers'), or 
Aunt Bea and her AOL account? If you mean Aunt Bea, well... God Bless 
her, but i'd rather not have her 'objectives' driving the direction 
of MY platform, if it's all the same to you.
