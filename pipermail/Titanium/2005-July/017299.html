</I>I beg to differ. The desktops are a consumer commodity, sold based on 
price and application availability, among other factors. Something which 
has always been scoffed at by all the condescending 
&quot;oh-we-are-so-superior&quot; Apple sycophantic crowd, for whom the old Apple 
way could do no wrong. &quot;Thank you&quot; for your denial, for justifying 
Apple's ridiculously high hardware prices, which clearly was NOT that 
superior to the competition and for YEARS of excuses which netted Apple 
a marginal market &lt;3% niche, and saw the migration of many users and 
developers OUT of the Mac OS. This resulted in us having way LESS 
applications to run on the so called &quot;superior platform&quot; of the past, 
and having to BEG former Apple Apps &quot;flagship companies&quot; such as Adobe 
etc to kindy continue and put out a Mac version too.

&gt;<i> Leveno is the cheap commodity champion.  And yes, the Chinese have the 
</I>&gt;<i> money.  China's leaders have realized that for them to become an 
</I>&gt;<i> industrial giant and a major world player they need computer

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Oh yeah? The Chinese need it cheap, huh??? CHEAP, Chris!!! Yet you said 
recently that it didn't matter to you if a 970-based Mac cost $7K. I can 
fish out your words, if you need a refresher. That's the trouble. If 
Apple had competed on the total price it would have done much better. If 
Dell can do it, so can Apple.

&gt;<i> Leveno is now the 3rd largest manufacturer of computers in the world, 
</I>&gt;<i> trailing only Dell and HP.  They're bigger than Apple.  Way bigger.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Hah...Lenovo is &quot;bigger than Apple&quot;..., now there's a 
&quot;challenge&quot;...that's probably because their &quot;crowd&quot; does NOT accept 
overpriced hardware tauted to be &quot;oh-so-superior&quot;.

&gt;<i> Take a look at the Mac x86 dev boxes.  I now have one to play with.  
</I>&gt;<i> It's a commodity PC - Intel manufactured motherboard, chipsets, 
</I>&gt;<i> graphics, ethernet, the whole 9 yards.  It boots Windows XP perfectly 
</I>&gt;<i> fine.  Except for one little problem; I can buy the same thing from 
</I>&gt;<i> Dell way cheaper than what Apple is going to charge extra for their 
</I>&gt;<i> fancy case.  Same thing applies to PowerBooks.
</I>
How do YOU know what Apple is going to charge for their products? 
Marketing is not a linear process. Just look at the iPod's success.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the past the PowerBook was a good buy because you couldn't buy a 
</I>&gt;<i> Unix-powered PowerPC-based machine anywhere else for the same price.  
</I>&gt;<i> Once your PowerBook has nothing but an Intel Centrino in it, same as a 
</I>&gt;<i> Dell, it better be able to compete on price point.  But you say, &quot;oh, 
</I>&gt;<i> the PowerBook comes with OS X&quot;.  Big deal.  The Dell will run linux 
</I>&gt;<i> just fine, and modern desktop linux systems are every bit as good as 
</I>&gt;<i> OS X.  It's still just Unix under the hood.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Somehow we're deviating here. People are still OVERWHELMINGLY using 
Windows. Has everyone migrated to Linux?

&gt;<i> Apple has done well selling a product you couldn't get anywhere else, 
</I>&gt;<i> and charging a premium price for it.  
</I>
Chris...stop it! Apple has NOT done well. It has bled marketshare, yes - 
major hemorrhage!!! With the result that it has been relegated to a 
curiosity corner. Please wake up and smell the coffee. There's not a 
single application that I know of which the END USER can say exists on a 
Mac and not on a &quot;PC&quot;. People like me feel like BEGGARS, yes, BEGGARS, 
trying to get developers to look at the Mac OS, and they ALL tell me - 
&quot;why should I bother for 3% of the market&quot;. Do you even begin to 
understand that???

&gt;<i> They're a hardware company, not a software company.  Unfortunately, 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple isn't very good at being the cheap commodity champion, and 
</I>&gt;<i> computers aren't iPods.  If an Intel-based PowerBook is $100 more than 
</I>&gt;<i> a Dell or ThinkPad with the same stuff in it, I'll buy the cheaper 
</I>&gt;<i> one.  And so will millions of other consumers.  A fancy case with an 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple logo on it isn't going to cut it in the commodity PC business.
</I>
Wrong! Apple is a software-in-a-specific-hardware-configuration company. 
And how do you know that Apple won't be able to compete with Dell on 
price?  I say HIP HIP HOORAY to Steve Jobs for finally seeing the light 
and doing the RIGHT thing. If IBM's processor turns out to be such a 
killer, that Dell and others will use it in their products - then so can 
Apple. Apple is FINALLY moving forward. It will use whatever is BEST out 
there and compete with others and SUCCEED. Don't like that? Well, then - 
just don't stumble on your way out.

Best,

Henry
