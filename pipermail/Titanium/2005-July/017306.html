Well, it's off-topic IF you own a nice Ti-Book, and don't care about 
the future of your investment in software... that a shoe that fits?

I don't knoiw about everybody else, but, i'm from the old school.

let me explain, in case there's young folks out there.

You have goals, or projects, in mind. You figure out the software 
that will be needed, and THEN you buy the hardware that runs the 
software. In that order.

  A lot of Windows 'fans' like to imagine that Mac buyers are buying 
based on 'style', or 'design'... Maybe Apple is 'banking' on that 
too, I don't know, since i don't read minds all that well, and the 
'signals' from Apple are 'mixed', at best.

I bought my 667 Titanium, switching from desktops, at first, to be 
able to run a big audio analyzer (fast fourrier transforms-based) 
anywhere: home, studio, Wembley, etc.

Although my main box is now an Aluminum 'book', I still have the Ti, 
and it can still run somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 thousand US 
dollars worth of audio and film editing apps. So I DO have a vested 
interest in the future of the platform, and it IS relevant to my 
current machine, AND my emergency backup Ti.

My last Cleaner upgrade (from my buddies at Discreet Logic), ran me 
$179 US... so what happens when the next update is as much, but 
either runs better on a platform I don't currently use, OR takes a 
20% hit in speed to run 'Native&quot;?

Don't waste time guessing, i'll tell you: I call richard at discreet, 
and swap to Linux (unless there's an OPENSTEP version) for a PowerPC 
ThinkPad. And for an old guy like me, that bought his first computer 
9with a buddy) at the Byte shop in mountain View (w-a-a-ay back 
when)... that is a sad proposition. Mind you, if IBM, or anyone else, 
had a 'real' working GNUStep, i'd already be there.. but that's 
another Titanium 'story'.
