<PRE>Kynan, et. al.,

I spent a couple of hours on the phone with AppleCare (I have a few  
weeks left on my 3 year contract) today and possibly squared my woes  
away.

I'd been having many of the current 10.4.2 problems (Airport signal  
weakness or absence, iTunes hangs, pauses, etc.) and more (hangs with  
3 beeps after a &quot;hard&quot; restart).  I just got my Ti 667 back from  
Apple with a new logic board, etc., so I was bummed it was acting up  
after only a few days of usage.

Since I was running 1 gig of &quot;after-market&quot; RAM (by Crucial), Apple  
techs had me put in the original RAM and give that a go.  The old RAM  
solved nothing.  The call-back to AppleCare appears to have fixed my  
problems.  The tech had me evaluate what was in my &quot;Startup&quot; menu and  
delete what was unnecessary (and that was not an Apple product).   
That appears to have done the trick (although we deleted little and  
what I would call innocuous).  I have read gobs of issues others have  
been having with 3rd-party software regarding Tiger and I guess I am  
another on that list.

Thanks to all the helped.

Sincerely,
Brad
