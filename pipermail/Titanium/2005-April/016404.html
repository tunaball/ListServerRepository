Just got off the phone with Apple. There is a problem with the 
trackpads on the new machines. All or some? He didn't know. However, 
the poor techs are almost as much in the dark as we are. Even the 
resetting of the trackpad, by holding the hand over it, instructions 
are spotty at best. How long do you hold your hand over the trackpad 
to reset? Do you do this in the finder or can an application being 
running? Do various trackpad setting effect the cursor jump? (My 
experience so far suggests - no.) With all the questions I had posed 
to him his response was the document is a little thin on content when 
it comes to this trackpad resetting. We laughed at the understatement 
of that.

He suggested they change out the trackpad with a different one. I am 
reluctant to send in my machine as we don't have a local Apple repair 
facility. I am going to discuss this with a number of Apple repair 
techs I know  and see what the early consensus is. This jumpy, 
twitchy, inaccurate trackpad/cursor is a major input pain but is 
still manageable in the short term. It jumps and interrupts the flow 
when you are constantly having to re-adjust the cursor after 
trackpadding but taken in context is not the end of the world.

Aside from this fixable flaw, this new machine is wonderful. Great 
screen, spectacular keyboard (major improvement from my earlier Ti667 
DVI) case design etc. It is ALL good with the exception of the 
trackpad caveat.

All you new AI owners what is your experience with the trackpad? Is 
it a hardware issue with only some machines or is it an 
across-the-board software problem isolated to this new AI powerbook 
release? If it is only some of us then I guess it is hardware and I 
will have to send it in for a trackpad replacement. Personally, I 
think it is software related.

Also, does this trackpad issue affect the new iBooks?
