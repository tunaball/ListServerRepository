</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hi Trevor,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I, too, am sorry to hear you're having difficulties.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;But, you mention (above) applying updates as soon as they come out.... Why?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;What's the rush? Let others be the guinea pigs, that's my creed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;regarding Apple's updates.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;They once pulled a minor update for iTunes that had a typo in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;shell script (after an 'rm' with user-provided root escalation, no 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;less) that proceeded to wipe home directories.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;10.2.8 was pulled in something like 8 hours. (Or was it 4?). There 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;are some folks who believe that there isn't 'really' a 10.2.8, that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;it's just a repatched return to 10.2.7, but the OS is schizophrenic, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and so layered, who would ever really know?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;My point is, for a company that prides itself on &quot;It Just Works&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;where the devil do they get the courage to look themselves in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;face when thousands of folks are having to re-install bits of java, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and re-done 'old' security 'updates', just to make the flagship 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;browser work?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Whatever became of that old chestnut known as 'burn in'? Well, my 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;friend, i let the others do the burning in, for me, and when the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;dust settles, and people finish blaming other developers (whose apps 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;were working fine one minute...), and Apple issues a 'security' 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;patch to fix the boo-boo's, then i decide &quot;Is this worth it, really?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Anyways, I'm an advocate of letting others 'experiment' with their 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;systems... i rely on mine too much to play games of chance. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Sometimes problems don't surface immediately. I like to wait at 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;least a few weeks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I don't have that 'blind faith' that seems emblematic of the cult of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;personality that has grown up around Jobs and the 'design' team. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Remember it was Amelio who decided to grab NeXTSTEP and beef up the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Advanced Computing group, not Jobs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;When you see the juggernaut of Unix powering things (in spite of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;resource-crazed GUI)...that's Amelio, and the 'real' designers... 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and when you see strawberry pastel-coloured iPods and 3D 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;icons...that's Jobs and his crew.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;With all the new billions in iPod sales rushing in there's even less 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;excuse (if there ever was any at all) to be rushing stuff out the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;door.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;My advice: let the 'early adopters' and sycophants be the 'test tubes'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you so much for your explanations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I have had an almost blind faith in Apple, and this led me to 
</I>&gt;<i> install updates straight away.
</I>&gt;<i> But the operation of my laptop is so critical now, that I think that 
</I>&gt;<i> is the last time that I will install the update as soon as it is out, 
</I>&gt;<i> having been burnt a little by 10.3.9.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will take your advice, and adopt your approach, of lettings others 
</I>&gt;<i> check it out first.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am somewhat disappointed that it has come to the point where I 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot trust Apple enough to get it right first time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it is not broke, I won't fix it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> regards,  Trevor
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Hi Trevor,

Sadly  - this is true.

Ever since upgrading to 10.3.9 the dock can't seem to hold any aliases
other than the &quot;fixed ones&quot; which came with it.

The preferences reset themselves such that I constantly have to refigure
Netscape etc, and the OS 9 works poorly.

Best,

Henry
