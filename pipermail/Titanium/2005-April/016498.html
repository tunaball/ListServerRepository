<PRE>Yes, you're right; DVD-RW is only 1x, but DVD-R is 2x.  Sorry I didn't 
make that more clear.

FWIW, I used to work at an Apple Authorized Service Provider; we didn't 
care if a drive had been upgraded to a different firmware revision.  
All that matters is that it's the original hardware from Apple.  And if 
the buyer has issues with it being upgraded for some reason, I still 
have connections that can take care of things...

As long as I'm discussing EVERY tiny little flaw; there are a couple 
tiny scratches or spots on the case.  Nothing big (I take VERY good 
care of my computers), but I can provide photos if anybody is anal 
about that sort of thing.  Also, there is a single blue stuck pixel on 
the very far left side of the screen, and a group of pixels about a 
half inch from the very far right side of the screen that isn't quite 
as bright as the surrounding pixels.  There are enough bad pixels that 
the display could be replaced, if the buyer wants - and I'm willing to 
take care of the added hassle of having it replaced, with the 
understanding that the replacement could take a few extra weeks, and 
the display might then have stuck pixels within Apple's limits.  I 
never notice these imperfections during normal use (including watching 
movies), and I don't think most people would, so I haven't gone to the 
trouble so far - and I'm generally pretty anal about that sort of 
thing.  I'll take photos if anybody wants 'em.

Make an offer - I haven't had any grabs at my original price, so it'll 
go to whoever lets me know their interest in the next few days.
