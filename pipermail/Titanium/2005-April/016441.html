</I>&gt;<i>and so layered, who would ever really know?

Thank you so much for your explanations.

I think I have had an almost blind faith in Apple, and this led me to 
install updates straight away.
But the operation of my laptop is so critical now, that I think that 
is the last time that I will install the update as soon as it is out, 
having been burnt a little by 10.3.9.

I will take your advice, and adopt your approach, of lettings others 
check it out first.

I am somewhat disappointed that it has come to the point where I 
cannot trust Apple enough to get it right first time.

If it is not broke, I won't fix it.

regards,  Trevor
