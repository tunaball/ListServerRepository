<PRE>I have stopped production of my ti-specific hardshell cases for a month 
or two as I move locations and finish testing the upgrades people 
wanted, like different available finishes of carbon/kevlar or 
silver(texallium), as well as a smooth black lycra covering of the 
foam(harder than it sounds!). I also took the opportunity to take out a 
few niggling imperfections on the mold, the last few showed them up, 
and once i knew they were there I couldn't sleep right till they 
weren't. i'll then be taking credit cards directly, and will price them 
at 225 shipped anywhere, 195 to list members. still too much? a cheap 
alternative:

There are several sleeves that work to protect from scratches and 
vibration, but not much else. I have tried about a dozen, most from out 
of the country, and grudgingly settled on one from japan, made by 
COMSTYLE(~30 bucks). i believe it's similar to the now available in USA 
zeroshock(i have a smaller zeroshock i use for PS and cables). one of 
these coupled with thin and very stiff &quot;trauma plates&quot; (i've used 
aluminum, carbon and titanium) has protected mine for over a year of 
worldwide traveling and daily skateboarding and other rough bangs 
reasonably well. not as good as my carbon hardshells, but the comstyle 
case uses .25&quot; (vs .5&quot; on mine) per side of similar damped foam, which 
is what does the protecting. the hard outer case or trauma plate just 
distributes a point impact over as much foam area as possible. in 
everyday use, i've twice dented my 1mm aluminum rear trauma plate. 
whatever did that would've just wrecked my poor book. you can use 3m 
spray adhesive to glue the trauma plate to the foam case, for a working 
solution at about fifty bucks, but that's ug-lee. For the record, I 
only used this trauma plate setup in a very tough oakley backpack, 
which has it's own padding against the wearer's back, and i had a 
trauma plate per side, and was genuinely careful. I didn't spend almost 
a year developing this case design for nothing. i have 4 friends who've 
destroyed their laptops (one was a toughbook too) in just everyday 
transporting to and fro work or the machine room. i can't afford to 
loose my tibook, and wanted some peace of mind everyday, so i had to 
make them. they really work well, and ok, i'm done plugging. my website 
has the info. suffice to say that the thin damped foam sleeves can be 
made to work well if you're careful! stay away from non damped foam as 
the foam doesn't absorb any of the shock, and transmits all of it and 
the vibration it sees into your precious lappy.

Right on the heels of the 17&quot; recommendations I'd like to ask about a 
sleeve for the 15&quot; (Al).

(I have an external bag that I want to use and so am just interested in 
an internal sleeve.)

Getting specific, can anyone compare / comment on:

      MaxSleeve                                 (MaxUpgrades)
      ZeroShock 15-Inch Notebook Sleeve         (Shinza)
      ZeroShock 15-Inch Notebook Sleeve (Large) (Shinza) ?

Or others similar to these ?

TIA,

++matt
