Hi Trevor,

I, too, am sorry to hear you're having difficulties.

But, you mention (above) applying updates as soon as they come out.... Why?

What's the rush? Let others be the guinea pigs, that's my creed 
regarding Apple's updates.

They once pulled a minor update for iTunes that had a typo in the 
shell script (after an 'rm' with user-provided root escalation, no 
less) that proceeded to wipe home directories.

10.2.8 was pulled in something like 8 hours. (Or was it 4?). There 
are some folks who believe that there isn't 'really' a 10.2.8, that 
it's just a repatched return to 10.2.7, but the OS is schizophrenic, 
and so layered, who would ever really know?

My point is, for a company that prides itself on &quot;It Just Works&quot;, 
where the devil do they get the courage to look themselves in the 
face when thousands of folks are having to re-install bits of java, 
and re-done 'old' security 'updates', just to make the flagship 
browser work?

Whatever became of that old chestnut known as 'burn in'? Well, my 
friend, i let the others do the burning in, for me, and when the dust 
settles, and people finish blaming other developers (whose apps were 
working fine one minute...), and Apple issues a 'security' patch to 
fix the boo-boo's, then i decide &quot;Is this worth it, really?&quot;

Anyways, I'm an advocate of letting others 'experiment' with their 
systems... i rely on mine too much to play games of chance. Sometimes 
problems don't surface immediately. I like to wait at least a few 
weeks.

I don't have that 'blind faith' that seems emblematic of the cult of 
personality that has grown up around Jobs and the 'design' team. 
Remember it was Amelio who decided to grab NeXTSTEP and beef up the 
Advanced Computing group, not Jobs.

When you see the juggernaut of Unix powering things (in spite of the 
resource-crazed GUI)...that's Amelio, and the 'real' designers... and 
when you see strawberry pastel-coloured iPods and 3D icons...that's 
Jobs and his crew.

With all the new billions in iPod sales rushing in there's even less 
excuse (if there ever was any at all) to be rushing stuff out the 
door.

My advice: let the 'early adopters' and sycophants be the 'test tubes'.
