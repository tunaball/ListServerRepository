<PRE>OK, now *this* message is my reply to ~flipper, who can still read 
posts fine.  ;-)  Confused?  Ask him - should've included his E-mail 
address in the last post, it's <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">lord.flipper at gmail.com.</A>

Hmmm, what a coincidence...  I'm looking to sell my PowerBook in a few 
months.  ;-)
No Titaniums came with 128 MB VRAM.  The prior model 1.5 GHz (from 
2004) and current 1.67 GHz 15-inch PowerBooks and prior model 17-inch 
have 128 MB VRAM as a configure-to-order option only.  The current 
17-inch model is the only one with 128 MB VRAM standard.

That said, I'm not sure you need 128 MB for most things; I have a 1 GHz 
17&quot; PowerBook G4 with 64 MB of VRAM which I use with dual displays most 
of the time.  I don't bother unplugging the second display when I play 
games, because I just don't notice a big difference by doing so.  The 
Bare Feats URL below essentially confirms that, unless you really need 
the extra 2 or 3 fps in an intensive 3D game, you don't need the extra 
VRAM.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I was initially after was a Ti 15&quot; book with 128 MB of Video
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RAM. I can scavenge regular RAM from mine. But I can't tell if they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shipped any Titaniums with that much vram. Did they? Or was that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 17&quot; Aluminum-only deal (and a build-to-order option on the 15s) ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem with the aluminums is I can't use any of my current 1 GB
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of RAM in them. Originally i wanted to stick with a dual-boot book,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hence the other half of my rationale for the Titanium.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Over the last year and 3 months I've had no way to reboot from a CD,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so having the dual-boot ability has saved me where it comes to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> de-fragging, and using DiskWarrior, etc. But, I suppose i could pop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a slimmed-down (no BSD sub-system, no Dev tools) OS on a samll
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partition and have that 'backdoor' available on an Aluminum book.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, what I'd like to hear about, if possible, is a 15&quot; Powerbook, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the price range I mentioned above, with 128 MB of video RAM. I'm not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as narrow-minded as i might have been, so a 15&quot; Ti with 64 MB of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> video would serve my purposes, I suppose. But a single-boot Aluminum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> w/out the 128 MB is a no-go proposition.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In time I will slowly rebuild the 667. I see it as a Linux box, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe a dual-boot Linux/OS 9 machine. (all it needs is a combo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drive, a keyboard, and a mother board swap &lt;laughs&gt;).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any help or advice (not to mention cllarification re: what's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually out there, or likely to be found) would be greatly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appreciated. Thanks.
