<PRE>No, I appreciate your comments about how the Mac OS facilitates using 
the processors.  It was a compliment.  I will keep your description of 
what happens.  Maybe I'll even use some of it at a party sometime and 
watch people's eyes glaze over.

I'm sorry.  Sometimes writing software gets me into a different state 
of mind and I start rambling :-)

I guess my thoughts are that almost anybody who uses Mac OS X can 
benefit from using a dual processor machine.  The reason is because of 
things like iMovie and iDVD which are bundled with the system, and take 
full advantage of dual cpu's.  If it was Windows it's doubtful that 
dual cpu's would show much advantage because the NT kernel doesn't 
handle thread scheduling properly, and the application has to be 
written specifically to handle its own thread scheduling.  With Mac OS 
X it's &quot;built-in&quot; - take advantage of it.
