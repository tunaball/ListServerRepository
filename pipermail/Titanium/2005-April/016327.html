<PRE>Go to unsanity.com and download their free haxie called Cee Pee You.  
When installed, it puts another item on the menu bar showing the CPU 
workload - in percent of capacity.  On a dual machine, two numbers 
appear.  ALL cocoa and carbon applications -- which by now is all apps 
of any consequence, the best having been carbonized for a couple of 
years now -- work with the Mac OS to distribute their CPU demands.  I 
have yet to see one of the CPUs idle while the other one is working.  
The numbers move around and often bounce back and forth as the workload 
is distributed.  Dual processors working in beautiful cooperation with 
the robustly stable and fluid Mac OS -- it gives me goosebumps just 
thinking about it.  My 2.5 Ghz DP liquid-cooled Mac G5 tower simply 
walks away from my 3.6 GHz SP Pentium Dell in real world operation.  
It's hands down faster ...and it's quieter, too - no hype, just a fact.

The only thing I have that doesn't have dual cpu's is my PowerBook.  My 
dual 1.42 PowerMac will mop up the floor pretty badly with an iMac G5.  
If you're looking at a G5, most definitely get one with 2 processors.  
The PowerPC 970 was designed from the ground up for SMP, and standalone 
G5's are not good performers.  It works on the principal of instead of 
increasing the performance of desktop and server systems by using a few 
narrow pipelined, very high clockspeed, high power cpu's, IBM would 
rather see multiple, slower but wider, lower power cpu's ganged 
together via very high-bandwidth connections.  This, incidentally, is 
also the philosophy behind IBM's Cell processor.
