<PRE>I think there's a battery failure that you're not considering here.  
Really, there are two points of failures: the cells can wear out, which 
might happen after 2 or 3 years of normal use, maybe earlier.  
Typically, you'll just see less and less runtime from the battery.  
There's another type of failure, however; the batteries are &quot;smart&quot; and 
have some logic inside them.  This logic tells the computer how much 
longer the battery can provide power, what its full capacity is, its 
charge status, keep the battery safe (by preventing overcharging, which 
on a Li-Ion battery can be quite explosive) and other data.  It is my 
guess that the cells in your battery are probably OK, or at least 
passable, and the logic circuits are confused or broken.

Of course, separating a battery failure into one of these two 
categories only serves to tell you what the symptoms are; either way, 
the battery probably needs to be replaced.  Batteries are consumables, 
they are not intended to last forever.  I was in a conference call with 
some of the laptop designers at Apple a while ago, though, and I did 
let them know that many people want improved battery life - and by 
that, I mean not only more hours on one charge, but also more charges 
on a battery before it dies.  They're really at the mercy of whatever 
the market can provide, though, so we just have to hope that battery 
manufacturers continue to improve their products.
