<PRE>hi =)

you are most likely NOT infected.
others might get contaminated email 'from you', but the FROM header had 
been 'spoofed', meaning it has been changed .... it makes it appear as 
if you would have sent the message, but you didn't ....
i got email from my dad once, that had a virus attached to it - but i 
know that he certainly didn't send it, since he has no idea how to do 
so .....
the it department that you described should be aware of email spoofing 
and when you tell them that you use a mac, they should understand.

what can you do now? ... the one suggestion, to let your windows 
friends change/delete your email is most likely as good as it can get. 
i guess there is not really much you can do about this, since you are 
not involved at all.
easiest thing would probably be to get a new email address for those 
folks ....
standard equipment like anti-virus software should be installed, also a 
firewall (-&gt; although in these days that is not necessary yet, but like 
someone said in future that might be the case)
i get about 4-5 mails with virus attachments a week ... they 
automatically get sorted out and land in the trash, it is still 
irritating though ... in the past month i dealt with 2 windows 
computers, that had different virii, browser hijacker, mal/adware on 
'em and the only way to get it going again is to re-install the whole 
thing -- of course most of the user DO NOT make a regular backup ..... 
well, i am getting of topic here ....

good luck =)
