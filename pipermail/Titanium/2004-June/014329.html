<PRE>&gt;<i> Remember the eMate?  I still have mine, but seldom use it since getting
</I>&gt;<i> a PowerBook.  For a PDA with word processing capability it was
</I>&gt;<i> terrific.  Connecting to the internet was inadequate, but for taking
</I>&gt;<i> notes, writing up reports, and keeping track of meetings and tasks to
</I>&gt;<i> do, it was perfect. And interesting.  And it went for 24 hours or more
</I>&gt;<i> (continuous use) between charges.  Too bad Apple abandoned the Newton
</I>&gt;<i> so quickly.

Sony are pulling out of the PDA market as well now. See the article copied

All the best, Colin.

&gt;<i> Sony pulls its Cli&#233; range of PDAs out of US and European markets
</I>&gt;<i> [MacUser] 15:19
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sony has announced it intends to pull its Palm-based Cli&#233; range of PDAs out of
</I>&gt;<i> US and European markets because of declining sales and the launch of its own
</I>&gt;<i> mobile devices, which will compete in the same space.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The move will be a blow to PalmSource, the developer of the handheld operating
</I>&gt;<i> system. for which Sony is the number two licencee, behind PalmOne.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With Sony's increasingly sophisticated smartphones jointly developed with
</I>&gt;<i> Ericsson, and the launch of the PSP mobile gaming device towards the end of
</I>&gt;<i> the year, the market for personal organisers and mobile gaming will be easily
</I>&gt;<i> catered for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A Sony spokesperson said: 'We consider mobile devices a key aspect of our
</I>&gt;<i> strategy to converge contents like music, movies and games with hardware and
</I>&gt;<i> since the Clie functions as a personal organizer, we wanted to refocus our
</I>&gt;<i> efforts.'
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sony will cease development and distribution of the Cli&#233; range in the autumn
</I>&gt;<i> of this year. The news knocked 12 per cent off the value of PalmSource shares
</I>&gt;<i> whose once dominant position is increasingly eaten into by Microsoft's
</I>&gt;<i> PocketPC platform and threatened by Symbian-based smartphones, which also
</I>&gt;<i> offer PIM functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, PalmOne-owned Handspring makes Palm-based smartphones such as the
</I>&gt;<i> Treo 600 available on the Orange network, and indeed Canalys still reckons
</I>&gt;<i> PalmOne to be the leading smartphone vendor in the US for the most recent
</I>&gt;<i> quarter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But for the handheld sector, it noted a growth of just 1 per cent. It said
</I>&gt;<i> Sony shipments were down 45 per cent year on year, compared with Sony Ericsson
</I>&gt;<i> smartphones, for which shipments had jumped 19 per cent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Canalys analyst Rachel Lashford said: 'Being very consumer focused, Sony's
</I>&gt;<i> handheld business hasn't really benefited much from the general upturn in
</I>&gt;<i> business mobility spending, while at the same time what were once
</I>&gt;<i> distinguishing features, such as integrated cameras and MP3 playback, have
</I>&gt;<i> appeared on more devices, including mobile phones, from other vendors.'
