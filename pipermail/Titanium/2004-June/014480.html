<PRE>mh, i would stay with the old film and paper .... why?
- because online access is not always that easy .... europe is modern - 
but also old and often you will look for internet access in hotel rooms 
... and won't find 'em.
- even with www connection, she will have to upload/send the pics .... 
connection has to be fast for bigger files ....
- is she backpacking ? i don't know about a laptop during her stays 
.... she would have to have a laptop to store the original size pics 
and to keep the online journal up to date though ....
- advantages of paper and film: inexpensive, fast, she can send mail 
every week incl. film roll if she wants .... and it has sth. nostalgic 
....

i guess in the end it comes to herself - what she likes more ... and 
how she travels ... i backpacked through europe and i also was in 
england (sleeping in the gardens in front of the buckingham 
palace/london, now i don't think she will do that, will she ?!
depending of the nature/way of traveling i would equip her with more or 
less valueable stuff .... i wouldn't take my digicam with me - instead 
i would get a cheap camera - make lots of nice rolls (also black and 
white ones) and later at home you can always put all that stuff on the 
net or scan it ...

nothing better than digging in some boxes ten years later to find some 
old diaries or notes from her holiday

&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> please speak up.  Here's my question.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My daughter plans on traveling for a year in these places (hostels for 
</I>&gt;<i> accomodation).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically she wants to keep a journal, do some photography, email and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am wondering about things like.

</I>&gt;<i> 1. Film or digital camera use (they both have their advantages and 
</I>&gt;<i> disadvantages)
</I>&gt;<i> Film - fast, less concern for storage, battery recharging etc..
</I>&gt;<i> Digital - instant feedback, can share directly with little cost 
</I>&gt;<i> etc...but battery recharging, storage cards etc..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I am wondering if I should provide something like an 
</I>&gt;<i> iBook(used/new)  for her to write, email, keep her online journal 
</I>&gt;<i> uptodate
</I>&gt;<i> (she does this at home to some extent already and knows the experience)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course there are multiple variables in here.  Access to internet 
</I>&gt;<i> connections-cost, safety of toting a laptop around,
</I>&gt;<i> camera setups, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone with experience photo-journaling around Europe in a non 
</I>&gt;<i> professional manner please post something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope some of you can provide some sage advice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cheers,
