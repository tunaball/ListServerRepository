<PRE>I believe that Apple developed that idea with the &quot;Knowledge Navigator&quot; 
movie it made circa 1986. It tried to show what  a computer would look 
like around 2010 or so. It had folding screens, a human-like assistant 
who would let you know when you got emails and voice mails, and 
interactive data bases. btw, the screen would also be a scanner.

I have a copy of that 12 min film but I''d probably break copyright law 
by putting it online.

</I>&gt;<i> additional LCD space.  This really isn't that far-fetched, I don't

</I>&gt;<i> hinge or extension mechanism for these wings, and getting a cable 
</I>&gt;<i> through there, keeping them as absolutely thin as possible, and having 
</I>&gt;<i> as small a seam between the different sections of the screen as

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point, I think the idea probably isn't quite feasible (too 
</I>&gt;<i> expensive, and too few customers), but it wouldn't surprise me to see 
</I>&gt;<i> it in the future - perhaps with the next generation of display 
</I>&gt;<i> technologies or so.  OLED displays don't need a backlight, and so are 
</I>&gt;<i> thinner and require less power.  See URL below, especially checking 
</I>&gt;<i> out the &quot;thinner&quot; link halfway down.

</I>&gt;<i> Along with this idea, you could not only have a 19&quot; PowerBook without 
</I>&gt;<i> carrying a 19&quot; case, but you could also have a 17&quot; PowerBook with a 
</I>&gt;<i> 12&quot; case; that's probably something that a number of people would pay 
</I>&gt;<i> for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I should probably go patent my idea if nobody else has already 
</I>&gt;<i> (and somebody probably has)...  But I'm too lazy, and not greedy 
</I>&gt;<i> enough.  But if you want to license it, just send a big check my way 
</I>&gt;<i> and I won't complain.  Unless somebody at Apple wants to license it, 
</I>&gt;<i> and then the price is a job.  Or at least an internship there next 
</I>&gt;<i> summer - I didn't get any that I applied for this year. :-(
