<PRE>Sounds to me like it's a logic board issue, though there could be some 
minor software problems in there too.  One thing that might help; do 
you have an external display you can use temporarily?  See if the 
horizontal lines or any other distortion appears on the external 
display at the same time as on the internal display.  If so, it's 
almost certainly the logic board.
One thing that might help is if you can find a service provider near 
you where you can walk in with the computer.  Turn it on, and 
demonstrate the problem to whoever accepts the machine.  It helps even 
more if you can make the problem happen while booted from an Apple OS 
install disk, or some similar known-good boot CD.
Just to prove to them that it's not software, you can back up and then 
reformat your hard drive.  See if the problem still occurs, especially 
before installing any other problems.

Regarding the wake from sleep crashing, this could be related to the 
logic board, as I mentioned above, but it is also often caused by bad 
RAM.  If you added any 3rd party RAM to your computer, try removing 
half of it at a time, or replacing it with the original Apple RAM.

&gt;<i> Just wanted to know if someone on the list has experienced similar

</I>&gt;<i> could be causing all my problems. I have a Ti 1Ghz DVI model with
</I>&gt;<i> 10.3.2, it has already been sent to service but they said that it was
</I>&gt;<i> software related and they did nothing, the problems are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Wake/Sleep problems, display stays black but you hear the fan and the
</I>&gt;<i> HD working.
</I>&gt;<i> -Horizontal lines appear on the display occasionally, sometimes they
</I>&gt;<i> disappear, other times they just freeze the screen. They appear when
</I>&gt;<i> the powerbook is moved and/or an external device is plugged (iPod).
</I>&gt;<i> - On powerbook start up, the screen stays black sometimes. I may have
</I>&gt;<i> to restart it 2  times to get the screen to light up.
</I>&gt;<i> -Recently I had this message in the upper-left corner
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Entering system dump routine.
</I>&gt;<i> A panic server was not specified in the boot-args, terminating kernel
</I>&gt;<i> core dump.
</I>&gt;<i> ethernet MAC address: 00:00:00:00:00:00
</I>&gt;<i> ip address: 0.0.0.0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Waiting for remote debugger connection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before sending the powerbook to service, I reinstalled the original
</I>&gt;<i> system, the problems reappeared. Also I have booted with OS 9 and I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't have any wake/sleep  or display problems. I have removed items
</I>&gt;<i> from &quot;startup items&quot;. I have ran the hardware test disc, nothing
</I>&gt;<i> appeared.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have not found anything and the problems persist. Any ideas?
