<PRE>Thanks Kynan for a quick answer, a few precisions though :
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why didn't you buy the AppleCare while the machine was being repaired?  
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>
Well, the discussion and repair lasted for about two months,  and I  
wanted to be shure Apple accepted the repairs before subscribing for  
Apple Care.
Once my Ti came back (btw with dead pixels on the replaced screen), the  
original warranty period was over; hence their refusal and my (third)  
disappointment.

&gt;<i> ... I find it unusual that the hinge broke; I work for an Apple  
</I>&gt;<i> Authorized
</I>&gt;<i> Service Provider, .... &#160;Those hinges are normally very strong. &#160;
</I>
I don't discuss their strongness, only their concept.  As a matter of  
fact they seem to be *too* strong.  The movement gets harder over time  
(lubrication issue ?) and this time, exactly as a year ago, the opening  
movement  is *much* harder than the closing.  The hinges snap during a  
perfectly normal opening movement. I can assure you, my previous  
experience scared the hell out of me, and I paid extra attention  
opening the Powerbook.
No, really, those hinges are faulty.
I hoped Apple would place new design hinges, as the problem was  
perfectly identified by then, but now I doubt it !

&gt;<i> Even of the dropped machines we get, a broken hinge is
</I>&gt;<i> unusual; more often the LCD cracks or the DC plug is broken or the case
</I>&gt;<i> is dented or whatever.
</I>
Well, I'm proud to say that I take great care of my Powerbook. It's a  
personal investment for personal use, and I feel the investment was  
heavy enough for that purpose.
This machine shows (only !) the well known faults of the Ti...  flaking  
paint on the bezel (which was NOT replaced under warranty a year ago)  
but no dents, scratches or other signs of abuse.

&gt;<i> Anyway, you might actually have to take your computer apart to figure
</I>&gt;<i> out what all is broken in it, but it would probably be expensive to
</I>&gt;<i> repair, even if you buy the parts used online. &#160;
</I>
It's all figured out : the screen part of the hinge, which is  
ridiculously thin alloy, broke off at its weakest point : the screw  
hole on the side of the screen.   This part also maintains the poor  
rotating element... see ?
I'm also surprised by the number of sites on that subject (like :   
<A HREF="http://www.powerbookmedic.com/xcart1/customer/">http://www.powerbookmedic.com/xcart1/customer/</A> 
product.php?productid=16323&amp;cat=250&amp;page=1&amp;XCARTSESSID=601180f42cd4439db 
00baad523abe16a )
A market developing on that problem, and Apple not recognizing it's  
responsabilities ?

&gt;<i> It wouldn't be a bad
</I>&gt;<i> idea to consider a new PowerBook. &#160;They use a very different hinge
</I>&gt;<i> design, which is probably even stronger. &#160;So far, except for the white
</I>&gt;<i> spots on the 15&quot; LCD, I haven't really seen any common problems with
</I>&gt;<i> any of the Aluminum PowerBooks. &#160;However, I'd still recommend the
</I>&gt;<i> AppleCare. &#160;And a good carrying case.
</I>
Thanks for the advice, I'll have to $$$hink about it,
but I&quot;m afraid to say the apple is getting sour :-/
