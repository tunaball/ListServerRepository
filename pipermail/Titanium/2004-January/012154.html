<PRE>Thanks for the suggestion, Lisbeth. I am assuming that you meant to do 
the &quot;squeeze&quot; on the Ti case, and not on the CD drive itself with the 
bottom taken off of the Ti? If so, I have tried what you suggested with 
no success. I have also lifted the CD drive out of the case and looked 
around to see if I could see anything that might be causing the 
mechanisn to jam, but didn't see anything. Not that I would know what I 
was looking at anyway...I am not a repair tech! So for now, when I try 
to insert a CD, it's the same result...it just slides in with no 
resistance as if it's an empty slot. Also, on start-up and shutdown, 
there is still no mechanical click coming from the drive, as there was 
when it was working.

By the way, I noticed that the CD drive was sort of wedged into the 
case with little rubber 'dingies' on all four corners, no screws or 
anything to hold it firmly. PowerbookResQ did it, so I guess that's 
correct.

Thanks again and of course I am grateful for any and all ideas on how 
to fix this thing!
