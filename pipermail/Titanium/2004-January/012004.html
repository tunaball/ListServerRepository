You really didn't miss a heck of a lot!
Here is the summary from MacWorld. Start from the bottom and work up.


Macworld Expo keynote coverage, updated live
By Peter Cohen <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">pcohen at maccentral.com</A>
January 06, 2004 12:00 pm ET

MacCentral's live keynote coverage has ended. For more details about
Tuesday's announcements, please visit MacCentral's home page.

For a blow-by-blow account of Steve Jobs keynote, read on! This account was
done in reverse chronological order, with the oldest content at the bottom.

&quot;We're starting out with tremendous momentum...with Panther. We've got a lot
of new apps,&quot; said Jobs. &quot;The G5 has great momentum with some great stuff
coming this year.&quot;

iPod mini also comes in colors: Gold, blue, pink and green anodized
aluminum. Apple expects to ship in February in US, elsewhere in April.

iPod mini: 4GB of memory. 0.5 inches. Sells for $249. The size of a business
card. Uses the same user interface as the &quot;big&quot; iPod. Solid state scroll
wheel. Buttons have been added right to scroll wheel. FireWire and USB 2.0,
either interface charges from the battery, connects via a dock-like
connector.

The second member of the iPod family, to go after the flash market. iPod
Mini.

Jobs claims the high-end flash-based MP3 player market is about the same as
the iPod -- about 31 percent.

iPod updated to 15GB on the low end for $299, starting today. Also offering
Apple in-ear headphones for $39, available today.

iPod: Last quarter, Apple sold 730,000 iPods, to push Apple over the 2
million mark. Apple claims 31 percent of market share for Oct - Nov. #1 in
units and revenues in the MP3 market, worldwide. &quot;We think the December
numbers are going to be even higher.&quot;

Jobs then showed a promotional video for iLife featuring celebrity
endorsements from Elijah Wood, Tony Hawk, Sheryl Crow.

Jam Pack for GarageBand: more than 2000 more loops, 15 guitar amps, more
presets and instruments. $99. Apple will resell M-Audio 49 key keyboard for
$99. January 16th.

iTunes 04 costs $49. Free with every new Mac. Available January 16th.

Mayer then demonstrated GarageBand's ability to simulate vintage and modern
guitar sounds using a MIDI-connected guitar. Mayer also demonstrated a
GarageBand composition combining recording, loops and his own live
performance. Also supports direct export to iTunes.

A new fifth app: GarageBand. &quot;A major new Pro music tool, but it's for
everyone.&quot; You can digitally mix up to 64 tracks, play over 50 software
instruments, play with a USB or MIDI keyboard. 1000 professional audio
loops, a la Soundtrack. You can record live audio performances, more than
200 audio effects, pick from vintage or modern guitar amps. Musician John
Mayer helps Jobs to demonstrate GarageBand using a MIDI keyboard. Mayer
complimented the quality of GarageBand's guitar simulation on the keyboard.

iDVD: 20 new Hollywood-quality themes have been added. Enhanced menus with
nicer transitions. Navigation maps. Enhanced slideshows. Better encoding --
2 hours of content per DVD. Jobs demonstrated key features.

iMovie: You can trim clips nondestructively directly in the timeline. Audio
scrubbing. Alignment guides (like Keynote) are supported. New and enhanced
titles. Video can be imported direct from an iSight. &quot;We've made sharing
even easier.&quot;

iLife 04: Includes latest iTunes release, &quot;works seamlessly&quot; with other
iLife apps. iPhoto: The &quot;number one feature&quot; is that it supports up to
25,000 photos with &quot;zero waiting.&quot; Time based organization, smart albums,
fast preview, Rendezvous photo sharing, rating, enhanced slideshow. Jobs
demonstrated new features. Books and prints will be available in Japan later
this month and in March in Europe.

iLife: Launched a year ago. iLife 04 introduced today. &quot;Microsoft Office for
the rest of your life.&quot; (When you're not at work).

iTunes &quot;fun things coming up&quot;: February 1st brings 100 million song giveaway
from Pepsi and Apple. One in three is a winner. Pepsi will run a SuperBowl
ad for it.

500,000 songs available for download and purchase today. &quot;That makes iTunes
the largest online music stores in the world.&quot; Jobs disputes competitors'
half-million claims because they're not available for download.

New features for iTunes: Billboard charts -- 1946 to present, available from
the home page. More Billboard charts will be added for specific genres as
time goes on. 12,000 classical tracks are being added today from leading
classical music publishers.

Top spender on iTunes Music Store has spent $29,500. (Not identified) 50,000
audiobooks have been solid in the first quarter. 100,000 gift certificates
have been sold since October.

iTunes: &quot;We have crossed our 30 millionth song.&quot; &quot;Moving in on 100 million
songs a year.&quot; Neilsen Soundscan -- iTunes has 70 percent of the legal
download market. &quot;It feels great to get above that five percent, doesn't
it?&quot;

&quot;We also ought to update its companion product, the Xserve RAID.&quot; Added new
features including 3.5TB of online storage - 30 percent increase. SFP
connectors built in for Fibre Channel. RAID set slicing up to 16 per RAID,
on the file expansion without repartitioning. Now qualified new Fibre
Channel switches. Certified on XP Pro and Windows 2003 Server and various
Linux versions.

G5 Xserve: Single and dual 2.0GHz G5 processors, ECC memory, DDR 400 up to
8GB, up to 250GB of storage. Dual GB ethernet, FireWire 800, USB 2.0. Ship
with Mac OS X v10.3 Server 10.3 and unlimited user license. Basic server
2.0GHz single processor for $2,999, dual 2.0GHz for $3,999, &quot;compute node&quot;
version for $2,999.

Jobs then showed a video featuring the Virginia Tech project team. &quot;What
they probably wished they could have used was Xserves, but Xserves used
G4s...until today.&quot;

Jobs: &quot;The G5 is our future roadmap in processors...you can't really talk
about the G5 without talking about Virginia Tech.&quot; Jobs then sketched in
broad outlines the university's $5.2m supercomputer project, the third
fastest in the world, made entirely of Mac. He also acknowledged and
apologized for shipping the company's first 1,100 Dual 2.0GHz G5s off the
assembly line to Virginia Tech, saying that Apple's aware that it &quot;pissed
off&quot; some customers.

Ho: &quot;Technology Guarantee Program&quot; guarantees Office v.X owners will get
free upgrade to Office 2004 if they buy it starting today. Office 2004 will
be released in the spring. [Please check MacCentral's in-depth preview of
Office 2004, due to be posted at 1:30PM today.]

Lead program manager Kris Barton showed new features, including Word
Notebook View, which simplifes how users can use word to take notes.
Formatting palette uses Quartz to become transparent/translucent. Word also
uses QuickTime 4 MPEG codec to record audio notes attached to notes. Excel
incorporates Page Layout View retains ability to edit content while
providing users with a more realistic idea of how their Excel charts and
spreadsheets look in real-time. Project Center allows you to easily keep
track and share projects you've created using Office.

Microsoft Office 2004 announced. Jobs introduced MacBU GM Roz Ho. Ho
acknowledged that Microsoft brought Word, Excel and PowerPoint to the
Macintosh first.

Jobs: Final Cut Express 2: $99 upgrade, $299, available today.

Richard Kerris: &quot;All about real-time performance for DV editors.&quot; Leverages
RT Extreme for real-time video effects. Demonstrated by showing a piece of
video that used four different video elements, all rendered in real time --
no waiting.

Final Cut Express 2: &quot;Pro video editing for everyone.&quot; It's based on Final
Cut Pro 4 technology. Five DV streams can composite in real time. Real time
filters and effects.

&quot;The transition is now over,&quot; said Jobs, referring to the transition to Mac
OS X. 10,000 native applications.

&quot;We're ahead of the rest of the industry [with Mac OS X]. Microsoft's
copying us again, it feels great!&quot; Jobs provided an overview of key features
of Mac OS X v10.3 &quot;Panther.&quot; Over 9.3 million active Mac OS X users --
approaching 40 percent of Apple's installed base, according to Jobs.

&quot;We're going to make something of this year. We're working on some
incredible products for this year.&quot; Jobs said they'll make announcements
throughout the year to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Macintosh.

Jobs talked about the legendary 1984 ad, which he said is widely
acknowledged as the best ad ever made. He then showed it to the audience.
Following the ad's playback, the crowd roared and cheered. Jobs then
introduced Lee Cloud, the &quot;driving force&quot; between that ad.

&quot;It's hard for those of us to remember how things were in 1984 when the Mac
came out, which is 20 years ago this year. People were using command line
interfaces -- it was very weird. The Mac came out and changed everything.&quot;

&quot;Welcome to Macworld 2004...We have over 60,000 viewers connected with
broadband coming in from over 100 countries.&quot;
