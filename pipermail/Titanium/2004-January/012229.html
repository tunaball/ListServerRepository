</I>&gt;<i> Apple's shameless slogan for X.3 was &quot;it is like having a brand new

</I>You have just learned an important lesson - YMMV - your mileage may vary.

Do I consider Panther money well spent? Yes. The Finder is more responsive
and doesn't hang when I try to manipulate a large number of files -
something I do on a regular basis. The new folder ledge of the Finder
windows has proven to be invaluable to my work flow. The way this integrates
with the file selector almost makes an add-on like Default-Folder
unnecessary. If you use Apple's built in CD burn capability you'll have
noticed it is faster - though no less wasteful of drive space in its use of
a disk image to simulate a CD. And lets not forget the sparse disk image.
Not new but easier to create for the non-techie.

If your partner has been using Jaguar happily with only 128 MB I fail to see
how Panther would be any less usable. That is truly the minimum usable - it
actually falls under the category of criminally insane usage as far as I'm
concerned. But hey, I consider 256 to be the minimum and with that amount
Panther is happier than Jaguar was.

Let's see. Desktop printers are finally back. The entire print center seems
more responsive and I see much less printer flakiness than I used to. You
might find Expose' less than valuable but not every does. And while I'm not
thrilled with how labels look, I'm thrilled to finally have them again. For
me Panther is more stable than Jaguar but most of that comes from the Finder
flakiness being gone.

Nope - my experience is completely different from yours. For me, Panther is
insanely great. But hey - as I said at the onset YMMV. Another reason to
hang back and let others do the beta testing.
