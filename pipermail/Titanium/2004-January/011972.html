</I>Last summer (if I recall properly) there was a long discussion about CD-R
media. You'll probably want to take the time to look at it. Remember, there
is a big difference between MOST of the music CDs you own and the CDs you
burn on your computer. Audio CDs are manufactured, not burnt, and they do
last a very very long time. I'm still playing some of the first CDs I
bought. 

CD-R media uses organic dyes which do deteriorate over time. I have some
burnt CDs that have lasted close to 5 years (these are Sony and Kodak Gold
media) and others that have failed in under 2 years. My current plan for
digital photos and music files is to use CD media that is archival quality
and reburn them every 5 years.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am wondering what is the best long term storage for digitized things
</I>&gt;<i> like imovie clips/home movie things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> VHS?
</I>
VHS begins to fade after a period of years. I was shocked last year when I
watched some M*A*S*H episodes I'd recorded back in the 80's. The picture was
washed out. I checked out some of my other tapes and saw similar
deterioration. Movies I'd purchased seemed less affected.

&gt;<i> DVD?
</I>&gt;<i> CD?
</I>
See above and I'd assume that DVDs are the same as CDs

&gt;<i> other?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any comments on this from people that know?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On a side note - My wife's uncle just got hired to the tune of $20,000
</I>&gt;<i> to do black and white photo archiving of a government information
</I>&gt;<i> because negatives last forever pretty well.  I laughed because I was
</I>&gt;<i> looking into whether this branch was going to digitize everything.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> comments on good long term storage methods?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Well, photos fade with time as well - so do color negatives. B&amp;W negatives
and photos don't seem to be affected as badly.


&quot;When will the public cease to insult the teacher's calling with
empty flattery? When will men who would never for a moment encourage
their own sons to enter the work of the public schools cease to tell
us that education is the greatest and noblest of all human callings?&quot;
