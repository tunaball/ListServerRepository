Most of which is untrue.  Mac users are typically more productivity 
oriented, creative types.  They don't care about what's under hood, how 
it works, why it does what it does, as long as it works.  I resent the 
term &quot;Mac zealots&quot;.  We use these machines and software *because* of 
the expectations of how a computer/software combination should work and 
what it should do, and Apple caters to that market.  Somebody coming 
from a linux background, for instance, will tend to be more interested 
in the nuts and bolts.  That's more than likely what attracted that 
person to linux in the first place.  I've seen the Mac platform bashed 
by linux folks, just because it's *not* like linux and they don't 
understand that it's *designed* to be different.

</I>
This is where you're focusing on a non-issue, Apple's Backup program, 
which is tied to .Mac.  OS X has the tools in it already to back up 
your hard drive to a CD.  You're a programmer, so you shouldn't have 
any problems using tar/gnuzip to compress your data at the command 
line, and burn it to a CD with Finder's built-in burning software.  If 
you want to automate the process, take a look at AppleScript - it will 
execute unix shell commands directly.  If you want further automation, 
set up a cron job to archive your hard drive every day, or whatever - 
the tools are all there.  Don't need .Mac.  Don't need Backup.  That's 
why the Mac is so flexible - if you like doing it the &quot;unix way&quot;, feel 
free to indulge yourself.  If you want to do it the &quot;Mac way&quot;, buy a 
subscription to .Mac, enjoy the convenience, and learn to accept that 
some stuff is built for Macs and we can enjoy it while the rest of the 
world can't.

&gt;<i> I've not been convinced by any argument that it makes sense to tie 
</I>&gt;<i> Backup to .mac thru the optional use of the iDisk is a backup medium.  
</I>&gt;<i> Yes that's how it is and I probably cannot change it but that

</I>
I think your doubts possibly stem from either;
* Trying to voice an opinion that the Mac should be like Linux - 
everything GPL'd and open, striving for cross platform formats that 
just don't exist in the shadows of what dominates the industry.  But 
the Mac isn't Linux and it has no aspirations of being like 
Linux........

* Or possibly from a misunderstanding of what Mac users like.  Backup 
is convenient.  It makes backups painless, easy, and it's tied to a 
paid subscription service offered by Apple.  The painless, easy part is 
what the Macintosh platform is all about.  Sure, we'd all probably like 
.Mac and its perks to be free, but for what it costs, it's worth it for 
many people.  You're possibly not one of those people because you don't 
like it, don't trust it, or have different needs.  I don't think anyone 
is trying to offer a convincing argument that it &quot;makes sense&quot; to tie 
Backup to .Mac - Apple does that because they *can*, just like 
Microsoft can tie IE to Windows.  But there *are* other options for 
backing up data on the Mac, just like there's other options in Windows 
browsers if you don't like IE.

And you're right - you can't change it.  It's the way it is.  There's 
workarounds, like the links I posted that show how to set up your own 
.Mac server so you can use Backup without a .Mac subscription.  But 
please remember that Mac users love the convenience, integration, and 
ease for which Macintosh systems are famous.  Not that they're perfect, 
but the so-called &quot;mac zealots&quot; consider them to be better than the 
alternatives.  And sometimes the features come with a price, like 
Backup.  But just because it's not free or doesn't do what you want it 
to, doesn't mean you *have* use it anyway.  There's many other options 
that are just as viable, and that might work better for your needs.

I suppose it's wise to let the thread die.  But I would like to extend 
an offer - if you'd like some pointers or help on how to set up your 
own .Mac server (I've been there, done it), or write an AppleScript to 
do backups to CD, or whatever, please feel free to contact me off-list. 
  I use several methods for backing up data, including .Mac, rsync with 
other offsite servers, and automated scripting.  I'd be glad to outline 
some details of some of the Backup alternatives that I use.
