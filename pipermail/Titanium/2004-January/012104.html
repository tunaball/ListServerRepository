I don't have an external display. I'll try to get a borrowed one.

I did it when I send it to service, they saw the &quot;problems&quot;, but they 
couldn't give me the warranty service because at the moment they 
weren't an autorized AppleCare center. So the book had to &quot;travel&quot; to 
an autorized center, where as I explained before they reported that it 
was a software issue. They returned the book almost 2 months later 
without haven't done anything to it. At the beginning it worked &quot;fine&quot; 
(I got used to the wake/sleep problem) but the problems began again.

&gt;<i> Regarding the wake from sleep crashing, this could be related to the 
</I>&gt;<i> logic board, as I mentioned above, but it is also often caused by bad

</I>&gt;<i>

The book has the original Apple RAM, I haven't added 3rd party RAM.
