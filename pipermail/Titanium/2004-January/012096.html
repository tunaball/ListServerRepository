Gonzalo - sorry to hear about these problems. 
All I can say is that I am running 10.3.2 on my 
15.2&quot; Powerbook G4/FW800 and I have never seen 
anything like what you describe. In general, it 
runs pretty well, so I have few problems.  I 
cannot really help in any way.  There are others 
on the list who could probably explain the origin 
of that screen dump, and what it might mean.  In 
the early days of X, I had a kernel panic nearly 
every day on the Ti-500 that I had then, and 
several people were able to help me at least 
identify the source of the problem (was my ISDN 
card in the PC card slot).

I suggest that this should be your main 
objective: to precisely define what is your 
problem, and its origin.  Once defined, a 
solution may be easier to find.  You seem to have 
carried out some systematic work that should help 
in the identification: for example, you report 
that &quot;clean OS install does not solve problem&quot;, 
which suggests that it is not any OS corruption.

When you say that the lines appear when you move 
the book, that sounds like a hardware (eg loose 
connection) issue to me.  But the fact that you 
did not get it with OS9 shows that it is not 
quite that simple.  So maybe some part of OS X is 
more sensitive than OS 9 is to some hardware 
issue (I am just brainstorming here).

Please note that my Powerbook screen stays black 
for 20 seconds after startup, before anything 
appears (as I reported recently).  This seems 
&quot;normal&quot;.

I am doing a lot of document (Word) processing 
these days (exam papers, etc) and I have had Word 
hang a few times, giving the spinning beach ball, 
persisting for many minutes.  Even Force Quit 
would not get me out of this problem.  I needed 
to restart.  This is about the extent of my 
problems!

Please let us know how your investigation 
proceeds, because this is always a valuable proxy 
learning experience for the List.

regards,  Trevor
