<PRE>Out of curiosity, what do you need the power button for anyway?  
There's almost no point to shutting down your computer any more 
(especially with OS X), and to wake it from sleep, just hitting a key 
will do nicely.  As far as the eject key goes, it is not supposed to 
eject disk images; only CDs.  Its behavior did change a while back (I 
believe it changed from ejecting all CDs to only ejecting CDs in 
internal drives).  For people's enlightenment, if you want the power 
button to bring up a shut down dialog, you can just press control-eject 
on a newer keyboard.  You might need to hold this briefly; the eject 
key has a 1/4 second acceptance delay to prevent accidentally ejecting 
disks.

Anyway, sounds like perhaps it's just an OS bug; try the display with a 
different computer and a different OS, if you can.  It's possible that 
it's a hardware problem, but not likely.  You could just wait for a few 
more OS updates and see if any of them fix it.  If you have AppleCare, 
you can also try calling Apple and see if they have any suggestions.

Actually, better yet, just send me your cinema display (please include 
the DVI to ADC adapter, I don't have one).  I'll even pay for shipping. 
  I'll test it out, and I'll let you know the instant I have it working 
again.  Oh, and don't bother trying to call me or E-mail; I just get so 
absorbed in fixing things like that that one might almost think that I 
had disappeared off the face of the planet with his 
multi-thousand-dollar display.  Rest assured, I'll have it back to you 
as soon as I'm confident it's fixed.

&gt;<i> Mostly my 1Gb 15in TiBook has its lid closed and is connected to a 23in

</I>&gt;<i> routines - and despite the monitor being plugged directly into (either 
</I>&gt;<i> of)
</I>&gt;<i> the PB's USB ports. Unplugging it and plugging it in again doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> help.
</I>&gt;<i> However the keyboard continues to work as do the sound control keys.
</I>&gt;<i> Strangely though the eject key will eject a mounted disc but not a disc
</I>&gt;<i> image. If I open the PB lid, the buttons there, including the power 
</I>&gt;<i> button
</I>&gt;<i> are all working normally. I'm about to give up on it unless anyone can 
</I>&gt;<i> put
</I>&gt;<i> me out of my misery. TIA and Happy New Year.
