Apple offering PowerBook G4 trade-in program

By Nick dePlume, Publisher and Editor in Chief, Think Secret


December 24, 2003 - Apple is giving customers the option of trading in 
their PowerBook G4 laptops for credit toward the purchase of the latest 
15-inch and 17-inch notebooks, Think Secret has learned.

Apple confirmed that US-based owners of the original and &quot;Gigabit 
Ethernet&quot; G4 PowerBooks will be able to participate in the upgrade 
program through March 27, 2004. In communications with dealers, Apple 
described the trade-in as a &quot;pilot program.&quot;

To participate in the program, customers will need to contact AppleCare 
directly, at 800-275-2273.

In a document obtained by Think Secret, Apple said most owners of the 
original (400/500MHz) and Gigabit Ethernet (550/667MHz) PowerBooks are 
eligible, with the exception of computers that have been dropped or 
have cracked displays, spilled liquid, or accidental damage. &quot;Any units 
exhibiting these symptoms will be rejected,&quot; Apple said. Wear-and-tear 
issues may not be a problem, however.

Think Secret spoke with one customer who discussed the program with an 
AppleCare telephone representative. Apple will provide $700 credit for 
all qualifying units, the company said, with the same credit value 
being applied to all models.

Apple said the process begins with a credit card transaction, after 
which the company sends a shipping box to the customer. The PowerBook 
owner then ships the laptop to an AppleCare service center, where Apple 
verifies that the product qualifies for the program. Two to three 
business days later, the new PowerBook is sent to the customer; the 
entire process takes 10-15 days.

AppleCare confirmed that the 12-inch PowerBook is not one of the 
replacement options under the program. Customers will be able to choose 
from three different base PowerBook models -- two 15-inch and one 
17-inch -- although it appears that build-to-order add-ons may not be 
available.
