<PRE>I am beginning to understand all the stories I've heard about mac 
zealots are all about. Don't get my wrong I do admire what comes out of 
this company and as a NeXTSTEP/Openstep Programmer from way back I've 
only jumped on the band wagon since OSX. Considering I paid $169 for 
Panther (Aus pricing) I simply would have expected that software that 
allows me to backup my hard drive to CD wouldn't be tied to a 
subscription service. Someone said that Backup uses the pax format and 
that's fine I was just explaining my reasons for not wanting to use any 
backup software that uses a non-standard format. I'm not saying Backup 
uses a non-standard format. I'm just explaining why it's important to 
me that it doesn't.

I've not been convinced by any argument that it makes sense to tie 
Backup to .mac thru the optional use of the iDisk is a backup medium.  
Yes that's how it is and I probably cannot change it but that shouldn't 
stop me expressing my doubts about why it is.

Anyway this thread can die if you let it.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I'd say, based on your concerns, don't use it.  Invent your own

</I>&gt;<i> it wasn't stored in some proprietary non-free .Mac service.  Right?
