<PRE>That is the thing with apple.  I am a big Mac fan, but I think their
customer service sucks.  I have numerous friends and relatives that
purchase apple products.  But when something goes wrong, Apple charges
an arm and a leg to fix it.  If they want to gain customers and to keep
customers coming back to the store, why not bend over backwards for
their customers??  They never do.   People I know who have dealt with
customer service say they will never purchase an apple product again. 
It is just like when the little girl wrote the letter to apple
suggesting a way to improve the iPod.  Apple wrote a shity response to
the little girl.  Apple needs to get this fixed, or they will continue
to lose customers.  

Have a good one,
Scott

</I>I had similar symptoms on a 1.5 Mh  PB purchased in Dec. 2005.  I use  
a Wacom tablet when it's on the desk so had been putting up with the  
problem - but it was a pain whenever the computer was used elsewhere.  
I'm running 10.4.6.

Believing this to be a hardware problem I called AppleCare - assuming  
the 1 yr warranty would apply. Instead of it being an admitted  
hardware problem I got taken through a reboot from the original  
install CDs to run Disk Utility - repair. This seems to have improved  
operation quite a bit - it is now acceptable although nowhere near  
the trackpad response on my old 667 TI. For this Apple charged me for  
a one incident call. To me this is a rip off - the trackpad is  
hardware - it should run and Apple should ensure the hardware runs  
through progressive software updates without charging  customers if  
they blunder with an update.

Anyway, that aside, people with the problem might try the above  
procedure before getting Apple's help.
