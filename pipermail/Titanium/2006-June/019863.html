The other side of the coin:  Why does APPLE Customer Support top the  
list in Consumer Reports year after year.
I provide independent support and repair to Macintosh users in the  
Mid Coast Maine area since retiring from 18 years with an apple  
dealer. I have frequent need to contact apple support regarding  
customer machines still in and some out of warranty. Only once did I  
get a poor response from the Tech on line, I terminated the call and  
on call back, with a different tech, the problem was taken care of.  
On several occasions Apple has provided out of warranty repair caused  
by the infamous iBook mother board problem even though the program  
had expired.
   Service in Stores can vary widely store to store. While managing  
the repair department when I was working in Portland, I made it a  
point if there was a problem I had to be the one to resolve things.  
Only with a few unreasonable customers who were combative in their  
approach did I everr have to say No.
