<PRE>Geniuses:

My Ti 800 came back from Apple in Houston on May 26, after having been
there twice in about a week, with the HD being replaced twice and
other parts being replaced as well (e.g., the inverter board, Combo
drive).  It has been running like a champ&#8212;truly like a new
computer&#8212;especially with Tiger installed.

However, shortly after it came back, and again this morning, faint
horizontal white lines and dots showed up on the screen, which
degraded photos, Word .docs and the entire screen, although the
applications still ran fine.  In both instances, the faint white lines
and dots stayed on the screen momentarily, and then were gone after I
rebooted the computer.  I launched Disk Utility from the installer CD
this morning, and under the category &quot;Checking Extended Attributes
file,&quot; the following message appeared:


&quot;Invalid leaf record count
(It should be 0 instead of 54)&quot;


At the bottom of the First Aid screen (aka Disk Utility), the
following appeared:


&quot;Repair attempted on 2 volumes
     1 HFS volume repaired
     1 volume could not be repaired&quot;


Based on this, I called Apple and one of its PowerBook specialists
concluded that I had a software corruption of the HD, and that the HD
needed to be erased and all applications and files reinstalled, to see
if that would solve the problem.  Having had two HDs replaced, and
just having gone through the reinstallation of everything, needless to
say that was not music to my ears.

In more than 10 years of owning PowerBooks, I have never had this
issue happen.  Does anyone have any bright ideas?

Thanks as always,
