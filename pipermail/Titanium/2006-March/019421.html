<PRE>Here is what I would do. ( I have had 3 powerbook and changed drives in 
all three--but mostly because they were too small.  2 of the 3 older 
drives eventually failed)  You have the new drive anyway.  Put the new 
drive in the case, Clone the installed drive onto the New drive.  Test 
reboot on the new drive.  Then exchange the drives.  Hard Drives are 
mechanical and will eventually fail.  After 3 and 1/2 years it is 
probably time--especially in a laptop.
