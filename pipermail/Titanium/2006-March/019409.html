<PRE>David,

Thanks for your reply!

&gt;<i>  My experience is if the Flash drive works on the PC it will work on the
</I>&gt;<i> MAC.  I do it all the time at work with PC users.  The Word files should
</I>&gt;<i> work on both platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some older versions of Word for PC and MAC don't always play nice.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> very few problems with the two latest versions of Office.
</I>
I'm not sure what version they have at my son's school, but I should be able
to test it using our home Win PC.

Should it be formatted for the Win machine? I'm assuming the flash drive
needs to be formatted, right?

&gt;<i> --But there are &quot;save as&quot; options for making the files compatible with
</I>&gt;<i> different versions.
</I>
I know this is true for some image files (Tiff comes to mind) but I've never
noticed any options for Word .docs.

&gt;<i> Is that the normal way other (PC) students do it?   It is really NOT hard
</I>&gt;<i> to network Macs if they permit that.
</I>
Don't know what the other students do but he really doesn't want/need to
network his laptop with their PCs. Heck, he's not even allowed to take it to
school with him.

OK, so I just tried a bit of cross platform sharing between the PC &amp; my TiG4 
PowerBook. Didn't format or anything &amp; first saved a .doc file from the PC. 
For some reason it made me reboot the machine though. Weird. I guess I'm 
just used to OS/X these days. It works but that the Mac adds a couple 
folders (.Trashes &amp; Temporary Items) &amp; files that don't really matter (a 
smaller version of the .doc with a ._ thrown on at the head &amp; a .DS_Store 
file). What's up with that? Also I'm surprised that the extensions aren't 
there. I thought that was a big Win No-No. BTW - The PC is a Win XP Home OS. 
Haven' upgraded to Pro yet.

I guess it'll work. He'll have to try a test next week before he really 
needs it to work on some &quot;mission critical&quot; paper or something.

Take care,

Frank Wiewandt
