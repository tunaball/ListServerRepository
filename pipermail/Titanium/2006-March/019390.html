while i'll grant the fact that chris has kept mum on specifics,  
perhaps there are professional reasons for this. perhaps he works in  
the security field. perhaps he doesn't want to give a lurker on this  
list (or someone searching the archives of Deja News or an equiv.  
site) any ideas on how to better enable their malware.

here's a metaphor to consider, perhaps not a perfect one, but bare  
with me:

          --&gt;&gt; you find out your neighbour is a terrorist. do you  
hold a block meeting with your untrained civilian neighbours, or do  
you call the FBI?

perhaps chris is in the predicament. we're only his neighbours, not a  
professional org. that deals with these things on a daily basis.

sure, the opinions of chris &quot;mr. mysterious the information horder&quot;  
olson might not be sufficiently open source/touchy feely enough for  
you, but from where i'm sitting, your soap box is just as high.

i think you both need to give it a rest.
