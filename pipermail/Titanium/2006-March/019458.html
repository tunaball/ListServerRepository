Bob - I have never seen exactly that, but I have had some problems  
with iPhoto, that has made album contents disappear.
All the photos were intact, but somehow the album structure had got  
corrupted or lost, and I was not able to fix it from backups, so I re- 
imported (5000+) photos.
It has happened twice (last year), but not any more.

&gt;<i>  Prior to this I would get a gray page with albums listed ,but with

I am not sure why you say that.  If you open iPhoto with the option  
key, you get to choose which Album to open.  Sometimes you have to do  
this (opening with the option key pressed) twice before you get the  
choice.  Quirky.  But then you can get those photos open in the  
browser.  Presumably you could also duplicate the backup to the main  
drive, replacing the current album, and everything would be OK.

&gt;<i> On a partition of the external HD I have an older iphoto library which
</I>&gt;<i> is not up to date as the back up is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as odd behaviors go, during 2 attempted uploads before the
</I>&gt;<i> blank pages happened I was having trouble importing some photos from
</I>&gt;<i> my camera (nikon D70) into iphoto. This is odd because the photos
</I>&gt;<i> would show up as a volume on the main HD,and I could go into the
</I>&gt;<i> folders and open them in Apple Picture Viewer, or Photoshop.
</I>
I also have the D70, and have never had any problem importing the  
(thousands of) photos from it.  However, I use a separate card reader  
for my 1Gb card (to save D70 battery) and that may explain the smooth  
operation.  It gets recognised as a D70 camera/photos.

&gt;<i> I've repaired permissions  and run Disk Warrior.
</I>
Get the latest OS update ?

&gt;<i> This is a major pain because iphoto is my &quot;working data base.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas -thoughts or anything - is appreciated.
</I>
I hope you get it sorted.  My current D70/iPhoto combination works so  
well, it could hardly be better.

regards,  Trevor
