<PRE>1. The Expos&#233; tiled view within one app (F10) is becoming critical to 
my peace of mind. I am always work on a dozen files at the same time 
and the tiled view makes more sense than hitting 'command `' many times 
to cycle between all the opened documents.
2. The new Finder is not perfect but little by little I am starting to 
get used to it. I am also grateful that clicking by accident on a 
network alias that is not available will no longer crash the finder. It 
will try to connect for a minute or so and then will report the network 
volume is not available.

I already sold 3 Windows users into buying macs in this last week 
alone. The first of these macs, a 14&quot; iBook G4, is arriving at my 
friend's house this Friday because of the holiday. Once his is up and 
running I am positive we can tag team and convert another 3-6 people 
from our group. The poor guy is freaking out and keeps asking me stuff 
thinking I am going to say &quot;sorry, macs can't do that.&quot;

This is what our last irc conversation looked like:

Alec: will the iBook ship with ftp software?
Pedro: you got some options:
Pedro: 1) mount the ftp server as a network drive from the finder
Pedro: 2) ftp from the terminal
Pedro: 3) get rbrowselite (free)
Alec: oh
Pedro: I am not done
Pedro: if your host has ssh and sFTP, then get Fugu (also free)

Every time he asks me something like that, the mac ships with one or 
two things to do it and there are two more available for free.

&gt;<i> I know I missed the boat a bit on the Panther upgrade (only just 
</I>&gt;<i> upgraded) but since my last post about Finder in OSX ruffled some 
</I>&gt;<i> feathers I'd thought I'd post on my thoughts on 10.3
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 10.3 is quite clearly the first &quot;polished&quot; release of OS X that I have 
</I>&gt;<i> used. A big thumbs up to Apple. I have started openly &quot;selling&quot; it to 
</I>&gt;<i> my PC friends, and can see myself buying an XServe in the next 2 
</I>&gt;<i> years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the plus side:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The real-world speed of Finder and most of the commonly used apps 
</I>&gt;<i> have been nicely refactored giving us a big speed bump
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Mail.app is around 300% faster on my Ti 400 than it was before. 
</I>&gt;<i> AWESOME!!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Expos&#233;, which I earlier had hailed as a &quot;gimmick&quot; to turn PC user's 
</I>&gt;<i> heads, is so much more than that. ON my Ti 400 where desktop space is 
</I>&gt;<i> at a premium I am using it _all the time_! It has replaced my usual 
</I>&gt;<i> command-option clicking on dock icons to achieve similar feats...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Threaded mail in Mail.app actually gives me a feature that goes 
</I>&gt;<i> above and beyond Outlook, and being able to partially hide the Folders 
</I>&gt;<i> drawer is good too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * the revamp of attachment handling in Mail.app is a LOVELY addition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I don't know if I am imagening this, but the new trash empty sound 
</I>&gt;<i> seems better optimized for playback through my crappy Ti 
</I>&gt;<i> speakers...not sure if this changed, I could be imaging this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The clean up up some of the previously slightly confusing preference 
</I>&gt;<i> panes is VERY welcome
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Finder IS easier to use with that left hand bar, and more economical 
</I>&gt;<i> on space. I didn't use the &quot;Actions&quot; cog yet, but it seems like a good 
</I>&gt;<i> idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Switching to &quot;Aqua Finder&quot; by clicking in the top right of a FInder 
</I>&gt;<i> window is genius. It won't confuse users happy with the brushed metal 
</I>&gt;<i> finder as most users won't even know it's there. That's the way to do 
</I>&gt;<i> it ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * AddressBook is improved in usability -- I think they could go 
</I>&gt;<i> further though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * HELP VIEWER IS FINALLY WORKING AT A USEABLE SPEED DUE TO THE MOVE TO 
</I>&gt;<i> A SAFARI ENGINE.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Software Update is improved
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Xcode is looking nice, a  friend and I even wrote our own 
</I>&gt;<i> (rudimentary) browser using the new &quot;Safari&quot; WebViewer object in under 
</I>&gt;<i> 15 mins. This is the stuff OO programmers dream of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the negatives:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I still don't like the dock (but that's more of a design issue than 
</I>&gt;<i> anything else) but since I have Launchbar installed I don't need to 
</I>&gt;<i> rely on it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Save&quot; dialogs still seem more cramped than what I 
</I>&gt;<i> would expect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Neutral:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I am yet to test some of the advanced Windows compatibility features:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * support for logging on to windows Domains/ActiveDirectory, was tried 
</I>&gt;<i> by a  friend  and was impressed!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Support for Kerberos for single sign on to Windows systems is great!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In summary:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apple have released an impressively fast, stable, reliable, useable 
</I>&gt;<i> and downright sexy OS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The HELP system was made usable. I love this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think Panther is much more than any of the other +0.1 upgrades we 
</I>&gt;<i> paid for in the past.
