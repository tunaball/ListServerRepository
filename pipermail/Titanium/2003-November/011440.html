<PRE>&gt;<i> Panther *does* act differently than Jaguar and it isn't for the 
</I>&gt;<i> better. If
</I>&gt;<i> you choose to browse the network and connect then the share doesn't get
</I>&gt;<i> mounted on the desktop.
</I>??? Is there some reason for this, I'm wondering?

&gt;<i> However, if you don't browse but manually type in
</I>&gt;<i> the name/address then the share is mounted. Join the crowd and send 
</I>&gt;<i> feedback
</I>&gt;<i> to Apple asking that this be changed.
</I>I will do this. It's no where near as nice as Jaguar was, in my 
estimation.

I guess that's kinda the point. The new Finder window takes a new, 
different, more &quot;visual&quot; approach to the OS. At one point some of 
Apple's marketing rhetoric was something along the lines of &quot;...do 
anything from the Finder window...&quot; A hi-lighted trash can in the 
left-most pane would be in keeping with this new, visual method of 
identifying where you are. On the other hand, I have to admit, it seems 
like a waste of space to include the trash can in the left-most pane... 
;-). Maybe a trash can that only came up when it was full, and you were 
looking into the trash can.
While we're on the subject, so would having the shared volume be 
browseable, mountable and viewable in an un-confusing, intuitive 
approach, as Jaguar had accomplished, without having to jump through 
network connection hoops to accomplish this. Here's hoping this is just 
something that didn't make the Gold Master release date and is coming 
soon.
