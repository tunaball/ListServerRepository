<PRE>I just leave the Airport on at work. But I use DHCP at home and work.

Are you sure it actually causes any problems? Or, just how serious are 
these problems? Does the log traffic affect the network or just the 
internal logs?

Perhaps there is an AppleScript or even some script at the command line 
to turn off the Airport if it's not getting a signal. But I'd like to 
know how you plan to automate turning the Airport back on (ie, how will 
it know that you're home?)

Suck it up. There has got to be things in your life that cause you more 
concern than this. :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With me so far?

</I>&gt;<i> Ok, here's the lazy part.  At home, when I crack open the laptop, I'd

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The normal-person solution would be to make two network locations for

</I>&gt;<i> less lazy reason ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any suggestions, including to suck it up and deal :-)
