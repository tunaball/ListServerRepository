<PRE>Here's what I'd recommend; reinstall that new hard drive, and do an 
archive and install of Panther, preserving users and network settings.  
That should fix the OS issues caused by a bad clone, yet it will keep 
your whole user folder intact, along with all your prefs.  Anything 
installed at the system level (depending on the company, drivers, 
screen savers, fonts, etc. that you may have installed) will end up in 
the &quot;Previous Systems&quot; folder.

If that doesn't work, do another archive and install, NOT preserving 
the users, and then copy the contents of your user folder into a new 
user.

Cloning works best if done directly from one drive to another; it would 
seem that you don't have the necessary tools to do that (a FireWire 
enclosure works great, plus you can keep using that old hard drive of 
yours once everything is done).

As for problems with fsck; it's not the world's best utility for fixing 
things, much like Disk Utility.  I recommend DiskWarrior as the one 
best program.  Norton is OK, but I've seen it cause problems, so the 
only time I ever touch Norton is if DiskWarrior can't fix a problem, 
and the data is extremely important (I am employed to do data recovery 
and computer repair, etc.).  DiskWarrior has saved a very large number 
of otherwise nearly unreadable drives.

Good luck!

</I>&gt;<i> complete its bootup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've reinstalled my original HD to get back to some work and send this
</I>&gt;<i> email. I'm ready to start over from scratch.
</I>...
&gt;<i> PS: what's up with doing fsck -y over and over with no change in the
</I>&gt;<i> results? IOW, always getting the same error(s). Is this unfixable?
</I>&gt;<i> What's with the over 100 nested folders error?
