<PRE>&gt;<i> Do yourself a favor: if you have the adapter with the thinner cord and 
</I>&gt;<i> no ribbing, find something to wrap around the junction to the power 
</I>&gt;<i> brick. My spare adapter frayed at both the DC plug (the ribbing was 
</I>&gt;<i> very thin) and also at the junction, and it burned.
</I>
I have the 550mhz pre-combo model...

Within my first year, my power adapter plug shell came off (on first 
gen white power bricks, this is silver, on later models, it is white). 
I was wary of using it, called Apple, and they sent me a new brick. If 
I had kept on using it, to remove it from the PB, I had to jam my 
thumbnail between the plastic ring and the body of the PB.

I kept the old one, and later on decided to glue the shell back on. 
Well, it has worked OK up till now. However, it just got a short where 
the thin wire goes into the brick. If I want to use it, I have to keep 
the wire bent 90 degrees (eventually I'll tape it to the brick). If I 
had purchased two extra adapters, one for work, and one for travel 
(first one for home), I am pretty sure they would last me for quite a 
while.

Where I think Apple could have done better, would have been to make the 
thin cord removable. This way, when the cord wore out, one could just 
replace that. But, since I am not an engineer (yet...), I am not too 
sure if that would have caused less problems.
