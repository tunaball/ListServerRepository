<PRE>Hi List,

I've been a Mac user for many, many years, and an OSX user since it was 
first released.
In '99 I finally bought a WinTel machine for some specific 3D work and 
since have increased my network with multiple WinTel machines-but use 
my 17&quot; PowerBook/20&quot; Cinema Display for 99.9% of my non-3D tasks (as 
well as some 3D tasks now). As a result, I use the PowerBook as a &quot;hub&quot; 
if you will (not a server), to monitor activity on my network, which 
was the original vision when buying this computer-and it works well.

However...
Over the years I've come to depend on Window's &quot;Map Network Drive&quot; 
option.
So the question is this: Is there a way to implement these same 
functions: &quot;Map Network Drive,&quot; and &quot;Reconnect at Startup&quot; using 
Panther? At present it seems cumbersome: I need to go into the finder, 
click on Network, locate the workgroup directory, then locate the 
machine within that workgroup. In the forth &quot;pane&quot; (the finder 
&quot;desktop&quot; being the 1st pane) I get the connect option, SMB/CIFS 
Filesystem Authentication window, which constantly has the wrong 
Username entered, and I have to re-type in the password every time 
despite the fact I ask it to remember it in the keychain.

This is functionality in the Windows environment that doesn't rely on 
&quot;Server&quot; software, so I'm hoping that Apple, in it's infinite creative 
superiority, has provided a way to accomplish these same tasks better, 
faster and of course more elegantly. I'm looking forward to the day I 
can implement OSX Server, but it won't be today ;-).
Any suggestions?
