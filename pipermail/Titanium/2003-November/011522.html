This sounds eerily similar to a problem that has really ticked me off 
since getting my Airport Extreme Base Station and 17&quot; Powerbook with AE 
Card.
I connect using the modem.  Anytime my roommate unplugs the phone or 
picks up the phone to use it, when I go to reconnect, the base station 
will dial and connect, but once connected, nothing will function--can't 
check mail, can't browse the web, nor anything else.  The only solution 
was to unplug and re-plugin the power.  After it resets, I dial up and 
all is well...
But recently, this has began to happen whenever I disconnect and then 
try to reconnect, whether its from being online until my ISP cuts me 
off, or just needed to reconnect for some reason.  I disconnect, wait a 
full minute for &quot;the modem to reset&quot; (is that really necessary, anyway? 
  My graphite base station never had to do that!), and connect only to 
find I'm going to have to reset my base station.
Also worth mentioning is when it's in that &quot;state&quot; I can't configure it 
from Airport Admin Utility, so I can't just change it from there.
On a different day I may not have even bothered typing all this out, so 
I'm sorry if its no help to anyone.  Though if anyone has any 
suggestions or ideas, let me know.

Benn
