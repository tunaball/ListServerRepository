No argument

No argument there either


&gt;<i> Saying these people are out of touch with reality is a slam on the concept of

</I>
Not referring to them at all. This is not an educated vs uneducated or
poorly educated argument but rather one of dogma and overspecialization.

&gt;<i> Though the 'reality' which intelligent people see may not jibe with that
</I>&gt;<i> perceived by those of lesser intellect/schooling, it does not follow that one
</I>&gt;<i> is more 'real' than the other.
</I>

The quote is referring to some extremely intelligent people with elite
education who become so wrapped up in the dogma of their specialties that
they literally cannot perceive reality even when it slams them upside the
head. Or they refuse to acknowledge anyone who would question their
worldview.

Halton Arp is a distinguished astronomer who has run afoul of the
&quot;mainstream&quot; Astronomy establishment for suggesting that &quot;redshift&quot; may not
be an indicator of cosmological distance and offers much evidence that would
possibly destroy the &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory. All he suggests is that the evidence
warrants a closer look. Instead, mainstream astronomers continue to get more
angels to dance on the head of pin to prop up the ridiculous Big Bang
theory. As a result, no matter how good or relevant the evidence he
presents, it is blackballed from being published or acknowledged by the
mainstream science community.

And for the life of me I can't squeeze in any Mac or Powerbook related stuff
so anyone wishing to pursue this conversation off line, I would be happy to
take up the conversation one on one. It's quite interesting if you are in
anyway interested in Cosmology or Astronomy.
