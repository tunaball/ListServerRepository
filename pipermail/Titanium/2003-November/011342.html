<PRE>Hi all,

Just curious if anyone has an answer that will let me go from quite 
lazy to very lazy... :-)

I have a 'Home' network location with just Airport enabled, since 
that's all I use at home.  I use DHCP since I have a router.

At work, I have a 'Work' location with Ethernet first, then Airport.  I 
use Ethernet 99.9% of the time, but occasionally I like to just pick up 
and take the laptop into the other room and keep my SSH connections, 
etc. open.  Thus, I have the same static IP configured for both 
Ethernet and Airport.  I can just unplug and roam and everything stays 
the way it was, but is now wireless.

With me so far?

Ok, here's the lazy part.  At home, when I crack open the laptop, I'd 
obviously like to have the Airport card itself switched 'on', but at 
work, I'd like it to default to 'off'.  This is mostly because having 
the same IP address on two interfaces causes a bunch of log traffic 
with regard to ARP and partly because it's just bad practice.

The normal-person solution would be to make two network locations for 
work, one for wired and one for wireless.  But that involves a location 
switch when I want to go wireless.  I realize that flipping the Airport 
on is about the same amount of effort as switching locations, but more 
than anything, I guess I'm curious if you can set the Airport on/off 
status based on the network location.  Maybe the answer will prove more 
useful to someone who would like to know for a less lazy reason ;-)

Thanks for any suggestions, including to suck it up and deal :-)
