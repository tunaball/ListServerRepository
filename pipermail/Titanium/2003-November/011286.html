Yeah, right off Apple's support pages they say it's unsupported - but that
you can do it. There are Panther on iPod discussions everywhere.. Now that I
look into Google, people were installing Jag on their iPods too.. Perhaps
different configurations were not working for people, but it's been/being
done...

Consensus is - it works fine.

Quoted below

&quot;So, Panther and my iPod are still running along just fine. I am thinking of
using it as a main drive for a day or two since it is so easy just plug in
the iPod and it just works.

Installing OS X (jaguar, panther, os9) on an iPod is pretty simple and
straightforward. Just plug in your iPod, make sure you have about 3Gb free
(for Panther &amp; Xcode) and just restart from the CD. It will mount the drive
as a normal disk, and you can simply select it from the installer. It's that
simple... really... honestly.

You can even use the iPod as your music device afterwards too. Technically,
(although I don't know if I want to risk the hard drive in my 30GB iPod) you
could install OS X on your iPod at home on your G4 Tower, go to work
listening to your iPod, then when at work plug it into your Tower or iBook
there. It's very cool. I can't say that the iPod will survive everyday like
that, but the iPod does have a standard Toshiba (I think it is different for
the 10 &amp; 15 models) 9.5mm Laptop drive. The only difference may be hard
drive caching and sleeping. If I had an old model iPod I would consider
doing this everyday to see if it would really kill it.

Oh yeah, if after you install OS X on the iPod and it doesn't boot from it
on startup, restart and this time hold down the 'option' key when it first
starts up. It will show a nice blue screen that will read (a little slowly
for my tastes) all mounted disks' System folders and allow you to select
which one you want to boot from. Your iPod and any hard drives should show
up there. &quot;
