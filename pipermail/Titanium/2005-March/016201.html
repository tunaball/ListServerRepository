<PRE>I have been considering a new 15&quot; 1.67GHz AI powerbook and although 
probably can't justify it, that's never stopped me before. My current 
portable of 2 1/2 years (longest of any Apple portable owned) has 
been the  magnifico Ti 667 DVI. (So feel reluctant to part with it, 
but it still has 5 months on Applecare remaining so has good resale 
and insurance for new buyer value.) The first Ti was the original 
400MHz and was able to use the earlier extra AC adapter and spare 
battery with the 667. A real bonus.

First question. Although the new AI uses a 65W AC charger/adapter, 
does it require it? And do they still use the same plug architecture 
as on the earlier 667? If memory serves, and it so seldom does, I 
think I remember reading you could hurt them with too much power but 
not with too little. The 667 has a 45W adapter. Just takes them 
longer to recharge the battery. Is this true?

Speaking of power, are there larger third-party batteries 
available/cheaper or are the Apple batteries the only game in town?

This model will have the 8X Superdrive. I understand it will now burn 
DVD-RW's. Will it also burn dual layer DVD's?

My Airport network is with the original Airport base station. I don't 
plan on upgrading it, yet. Will this newer Extreme card work without 
issue(s)? I know it will default to the slower broadcast rate but are 
there any issues?

I'm thinking the 64MB 9700 video card will suffice as I won't be 
using the portable as a desktop replacement. Or is the 128MB card 
worth the extra dollars? I know everyone's needs are different, I'm 
just looking for the kind of thoughtful input this list is always 
generating. I will upgrade the RAM to 1GB.

And finally, all my software and OS is current and upgraded. I plan 
to just Carbon Clone the Ti and load it on to the AI? Or does OSX 
install by picking and choosing what it requires a la carte re: CPU? 
And as a result, I won't have everything the newer machine requires 
in the installed OSX.3.8. True or false?

Appreciate any/all opinions/suggestions.

Thanks &amp; Happy Easter to everyone!
Rod
