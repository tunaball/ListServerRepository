<PRE>Answers are inserted below each question.

&gt;<i> I have been considering a new 15&quot; 1.67GHz AI powerbook and although
</I>&gt;<i> probably can't justify it, that's never stopped me before. My current
</I>&gt;<i> portable of 2 1/2 years (longest of any Apple portable owned) has
</I>&gt;<i> been the  magnifico Ti 667 DVI. (So feel reluctant to part with it,
</I>&gt;<i> but it still has 5 months on Applecare remaining so has good resale
</I>&gt;<i> and insurance for new buyer value.) The first Ti was the original
</I>&gt;<i> 400MHz and was able to use the earlier extra AC adapter and spare
</I>&gt;<i> battery with the 667. A real bonus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First question. Although the new AI uses a 65W AC charger/adapter,
</I>&gt;<i> does it require it? And do they still use the same plug architecture
</I>&gt;<i> as on the earlier 667? If memory serves, and it so seldom does, I
</I>&gt;<i> think I remember reading you could hurt them with too much power but
</I>&gt;<i> not with too little. The 667 has a 45W adapter. Just takes them
</I>&gt;<i> longer to recharge the battery. Is this true?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Both use the same plug. According to what I've heard the 45 watt charger
will work but charge slowly.

&gt;<i> Speaking of power, are there larger third-party batteries
</I>&gt;<i> available/cheaper or are the Apple batteries the only game in town?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This model will have the 8X Superdrive. I understand it will now burn
</I>&gt;<i> DVD-RW's. Will it also burn dual layer DVD's?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My Airport network is with the original Airport base station. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> plan on upgrading it, yet. Will this newer Extreme card work without
</I>&gt;<i> issue(s)? I know it will default to the slower broadcast rate but are
</I>&gt;<i> there any issues?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>No issues.

&gt;<i> I'm thinking the 64MB 9700 video card will suffice as I won't be
</I>&gt;<i> using the portable as a desktop replacement. Or is the 128MB card
</I>&gt;<i> worth the extra dollars? I know everyone's needs are different, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> just looking for the kind of thoughtful input this list is always
</I>&gt;<i> generating. I will upgrade the RAM to 1GB.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I don't know what you plan on doing but Doom 3 will run on the base model.

&gt;<i> And finally, all my software and OS is current and upgraded. I plan
</I>&gt;<i> to just Carbon Clone the Ti and load it on to the AI? Or does OSX
</I>&gt;<i> install by picking and choosing what it requires a la carte re: CPU?
</I>&gt;<i> And as a result, I won't have everything the newer machine requires
</I>&gt;<i> in the installed OSX.3.8. True or false?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Apple include an application included to migrate your older software and
documents over to the new machine. I don't recall it name though

&gt;<i> Appreciate any/all opinions/suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks &amp; Happy Easter to everyone!
</I>&gt;<i> Rod
