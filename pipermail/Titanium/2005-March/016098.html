<PRE>I have an original first generation 500 Mhz TiBook. When I first got 
it, it had one stuck pixel on the lower right side. It was *bright* 
read and EASILY visible. I was able to massage it back into working and 
I've never had a problem with it since.

I've always had a shotgun cluster of very light and very small dots in 
the middle of my screen, but I went for a LONG time without realizing 
it. They really can't be seen unless you look hard when there's a solid 
black background. They've always been most annoying/noticeable when 
viewing a DVD. For a long time I thought it was a DVD player artifact 
because the dots were so hard to see during normal usage but I've come 
to know that they're always there.

It wasn't annoying enough to make me give up my daily (hourly!) 
dependance upon my TiBook for repair at Apple.

I had always thought that stuck or dead pixels were *glaringly* obvious 
(like my original one) instead of very subtle. Was my original one a 
small cluster of stuck pixels? Now that I think about screen 
resolution, I realize that these current aberrations are pretty small 
and perhaps bad pixels. Are the sub-pixels smaller?

Anyway, I've got much more serious PowerBook problems at the moment, 
and I'm still under AppleCare, so I'll be trucking down to the Apple 
Store. I'm going to ask about the pixels.

Thoughts?

Anybody know what the wait time is for motherboards or major parts for 
old TiBooks like mine that are in for repair under AppleCare?

TIA, j mcd
