<PRE>Refitting

Next step was to bend/pry the old hinges away and mount the new ones. I 
carefully tried to remove the old glue before applying new. I used 
&#8220;Strong Epoxy Metal&#8221; to the hinges &#8211; it is gray, filling, handles damp 
conditions, many chemicals, temp up to 100deg Celsius, glues: steel, 
aluminum, concrete, stone, wood, polyester. The front bezel was 
slightly twisted so I had to straighten it before I glued it back. I 
used a common (in Sweden) glue called &#8220;contact glue&#8221; &#8211; you apply it to 
both surfaces, wait for a couple of minutes (until it starts to dry), 
and press the parts together &#8211; glues leather, rubber, metal and is easy 
to remove should some squeeze-out occur.

The clamps I used were the smallest ones I found - but bigger than 
clothespins. I was referring to a picture with clamps (part of a 
&#8220;hinge-repair-instruction&#8221;) that I got with the hinges. I actually fond 
what looks exactly like those in the picture. I used 16. Going back to 
my digital photos I can see the black marks appearing after the front 
bezel is removed - and before the hinges are removed = clamps are ok. I 
will use clothespins as you suggest next time anyway. The marks looks 
like &#8220;wet black spots&#8221; some with thin &#8220;cracks&#8221; going through others 
with some embedded &#8220;living&#8221; pixels. Most are along the edges, but one 
is quite central (this one though, has a thin line/crack connecting to 
a bigger black area in the lower left corner).

Additional tip: I used the opportunity to Paint the TiBook edge.
I have had some serious color flaking at the plastic/carbon? edge and 
took the opportunity to repaint the edge when everything was apart. 
Took all the old two layers of color away, grinded and did some serious 
masking before spraying. Looks really good &#8211; a lot better than TiPaint 
etc! New hinges works smooth and the magnetic hook locks the computer 
perfect.

I hope this will be of help to others exchanging their hinges or 
repainting their TiBooks - just take care around a working lcd! :)
