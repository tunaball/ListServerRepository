<PRE>Geat story! The salesman&#185;s face must have been red!

Yes, even OrangeWare drivers for Atheros cards say you should install the
drivers before plugging in the card.

I haven&#185;t tried my 3Com card without drivers, but I suspect that the Mac
would not know what to do with it and could go into a kernel panic.

I assume your Verizon card is one that has the Broadcom chipset rather then
the Altheros? Is there any way you could find out? I would really like to
know if the Mac is capable of knowing what to do with an Altheros card
without 3rd party drivers.

&gt;<i> As a follow on to Steve's experience, I've got a bit to add...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On Steve's suggestion, I went to my local Verizon store and bought the PC
</I>&gt;<i> 5220. The salesman gave me the MTN number and the ESN number that I was
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to enter after installing the software from the CD. The salesperson
</I>&gt;<i> warned me to make sure that I installed the software before inserting the PC
</I>&gt;<i> card or else I would probably break the card as he had had to replace several
</I>&gt;<i> cards for customers that had not properly installed the software. Still being
</I>&gt;<i> in the store, I inserted the CD into my Mac and I immediately recognized that
</I>&gt;<i> it was only PC programs and some pdfs. I put the CD back into the box. Asking
</I>&gt;<i> the salesperson about this, he replied that he would find out about Mac
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility and he disappeared behind the partition.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Being the daredevil that I am, I brazenly inserted the PC card into my Mac.
</I>&gt;<i> After a few seconds, up popped a dialog telling me that I had inserted a
</I>&gt;<i> Verizon wireless card and that I must authorize the installation of software.
</I>&gt;<i> My Mac then showed me the standard Admin password dialog where I typed in my
</I>&gt;<i> password. About 10 seconds later, I noticed a Connect menu in the menu bar.
</I>&gt;<i> What the heck. I selected Connect from the menu bar and in started flowing the
</I>&gt;<i> 200 emails that were awaiting me. After about 10 minutes, the salesperson
</I>&gt;<i> reappeared and said, Sorry, it wasn't going to be able to work on my Mac.
</I>
