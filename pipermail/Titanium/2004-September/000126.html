Very interesting reading, going through the entire boot process. I 
have a simple question, though.

I installed the 2004-08-09 security update, that was mainly involving 
the png issue.

Instead of rebooting, i tried using the SystemStarter to just run 
what i thought was the service involved in the update. I goofed on 
that one, because CoreGraphics isn't a service. I think it just 
popints to a couple of other scripts. (&lt;--guessing on that one). 
However, in thinking back I am thinking coreservicesd was probably 
what i wanted to restart. Does that sound about right?

Instead, i goofed up somehow. i ran SystemStarter restart, with no 
service argument. All seemed well, but in very short order i had some 
invisible file eating startup drive space. I went from 3.3 GB of free 
space, down to less than 330k, in several minutes. Heheh, a bit 
scary, so i rebooted. I checked file sizes of all the Home 
directories, as well as System, and the Libraries, and all seemed to 
be sized normally. So it was a real mystery. As the apps were killed 
by the reboot, i could see additional free space opening up, and it 
wasn't VM, because my swap files are on an external drive...

Question is two-fold: Was coreservicesd the appropriate service to 
add to the arguments,as far as the update in question was concerned, 
and what might have been the cause of the mystery free space 
disappearance?

thanks,
~flipper
