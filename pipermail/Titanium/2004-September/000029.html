well that IS good news. I was familiar with the OWC patch for 
external drives to run iDVD, etc, but this is much more important to 
me. Thanks Chris,

By the way, i know you know your stuff vis-a-vis the Ti parts and 
all.   In the fall from the ledge last year (aka the 'theft'), my 
Power key was bent also. It works fine, but is a bit unsettling with 
it appearing 'depressed' (as in 'on the bias', not 'sad'). One edge 
of the silver power button is pretty well flush with the book (maybe 
a couple millis below the rim), but the opposite edge of the button 
is clearly a few 'extra' millis lower. It's been a while since the 
accident, and I forget if there is any actual 'tactile' response from 
a normal button when pressed. Is there?

Also, in an unrelated event. My internal keyboard generates 
characters all on it's own. Terribly bad when signing-in somewhere, 
logging on to anything, etc. I keep it disconnected internally and 
all is well, of course. But I lug around a keyboard.

So what's up with the keyboards for the 667s, are they pretty 
interchangeable with 'neighboring models', and is it certain (as 
seems logical), that the character generation issue is localised to 
the actual keypad, and not internally generated? It never does 
anything while disconnected, but i fear some sort of 'interdependent' 
issue. (as in &quot;IF the keyboard is plugged in AND some &lt;unspecified 
situation&gt; is also present, THEN...). Nothing has ever spilled on it 
or in it, so i have no idea what started it all, but it started early 
on.
