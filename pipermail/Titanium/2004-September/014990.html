<PRE>They recognized it a long time ago.  I think the first public admission 
might have been in a financial conference call, when they said that the 
problem had been identified and fixed, and that no more new computers 
were shipping with this issue.
I'm also pretty sure that we received specific instructions from Apple 
at the service provider I used to work for on how to deal with this 
issue.  I believe that in addition to the instructions on how to 
prevent the problem from recurring, we were told to cover it under 
warranty.  The reason why they put up that page is because these 
PowerBooks are now leaving their warranty coverage, and there are still 
a few of the affected computers left out there.

&gt;<i> My 15&quot; aluminium G4 Powerbook that I bought one year ago, when they
</I>&gt;<i> were announced, has four &quot;white spots&quot; on the screen.  This issue is
</I>&gt;<i> just now recognized 'officially' by Apple, as this link shows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/powerbook/displayprogram/">http://www.apple.com/support/powerbook/displayprogram/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is good news for me and others on the List who may have this
</I>&gt;<i> problem - because it means we do not need to fight or argue the case,
</I>&gt;<i> it is an admitted issue.
