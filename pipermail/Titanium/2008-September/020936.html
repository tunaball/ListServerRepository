<PRE>Better information has never been posted. Anyone who has information  
they consider important on their computer should have it backed up on  
a regular basis.  I have a G4 15&quot; PowerMac. It is about 3 years old  
and running as smoothly as the day I purchased it. I backup using  
firewire on an external HD. I backup my complete HD (bootable). After  
your initial backup it is a snap to backup your new information each  
day. I use SuperDuper and Intego Personal Backup to perform the  
backup (more on this below). At least once I lost everything on my  
computer and my backup saved many hours of reinstalling all my  
applications, passwords  (many lost). Some information was lost  
forever. After that nightmare I would never be without an external  
drive with a complete bootable copy of my HD.

Concerning backup programs. I have Intego Virus Barrier and Intego  
Personal Backup X5 and SuperDuper on my computer.  When I tried to  
backup with SuperDuper about halfway through the backup it would  
stop.  When I backed up using Personal Backup I always ended up with  
one error. The external HD was still bootable and had my information  
on it. I traced my error to Virus Barrier which had detected  
something it could not copy.  I then called SuperDuper and they said  
the item not only would not copy on SuperDuper but would always cause  
it to stop. They put it on Virus Barrier.  I called Intego and they  
put the problem on SuperDuper but did provide me with information to  
eliminate the error which was to go to preferences in Virus Barrier  
and turn off the scanner which would turn back on after the  
completion of the backup. It also allowed me to use SuperDuper by  
turning off the scanner in Virus Barrier. This for anyone having  
trouble cloning and using Virus Barrier and Personal Backup or  
SuperDuper.
