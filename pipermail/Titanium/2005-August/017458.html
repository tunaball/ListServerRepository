With a Titanium here, and an Aluminum, I can compare a couple of these installation/removal changes. And it's no wonder certain processes void the warranty.

Take the keyboards: The Titanium's keyboard can be removed by a child.  The Aluminum requires removal of the bottom case, and that's just for starters. It is an unbelievably complex maneuver.

Meanwhile, I put an Airport Extreme card in the Al-Book. That was about on the level of say, putting a credit card in an ATM. Trivial. So, I decided to donate my old, unused Airport card, in the Titanium Powerbook, to a needy fellow. I figured why not? I have the tools, it can't be that bad...

I know a lot of the folks here could probably do this little job in their sleep, but it's been 27 years since I was troubleshooting the hardware innards of mainframes and what used to be called, 'minis', and to be honest, modular replacements were a lot easier then...everything was a lot bigger, and simpler. &lt;laughs&gt;

Now I get to tell a low-budget chinese foreign exchange student, &quot;Sorry, i'm too stupid to get the card out without putting the 'book' in jeopardy.&quot; (which I cannot risk, for other reasons). What a mess.
