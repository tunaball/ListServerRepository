It came to light today that Adobe will probably not have an x86  
version of Photoshop, or any of the other apps in Adobe CS, available  
for OS X on x86 when Apple releases the hardware.  Bruce Chizen  
offers a glimpse of reality instead of the twisted illusion of the  
Reality Distortion Field where you simply click a checkbox in Xcode  
and BOOM! instant fat binary.

In an interview with CNet, Bruce Chizen was asked:
&quot;Let's talk about Apple Computer. What is the early word about moving  
Mac apps over to work on Intel-based systems? Not so easy?&quot;

Chizen: &quot;Steve (Jobs) likes to trivialize the process and make it  
seem easy, but moving the apps over is not that easy...Getting over  
to MacTel is work..........It's not that easy because you have to  
compile the app, you have to test it. If you look at most testing  
cycles, for any complex cycle, for any complex product, that's three  
or four months until it's out. You just can't turn a switch and get a  
MacTel product--and Steve knows that.&quot;
CNet: So, when do you think that Adobe will be ready to take Photoshop?
Chizen: &quot;I haven't given a date yet, I'd be surprised if we did a  
MacTel only release. I think you'll find us doing what we did with OS  
X, which is to enhance the product and support the new environment at  
the same time. If you look at our product cycles for products like  
Photoshop and Creative Suite, they tend to be in the 18- to 24-month  
cycle, which means that you're talking about either Q4 of '06 or Q1  
of '07.&quot;
