<PRE>Hello all,

I had no problem with AppleCare, regarding my warranty be voided (once I replaced the original RAM and hard drive).  It is obvious to anyone who looks at the area around my hard drive that I have removed it, but AppleCare has never flinched at working on my PowerBook (although my problems have never involved the hard drive - mine have been logic board issues).

Regarding AppleCare service dates, FYI, AppleCare told me that for any issue that AppleCare has deemed worthy of their attention, said issue will be resolved by AppleCare - even after the AppleCare service dates have expired - as long as the issue was brought to AppleCare's attention within the service contract period (I am experiencing such a situation as I write this with nil resistance from AppleCare - on the contrary, my AppleCare experiences have always been exemplary - customer service wise).

Sincerely,
Brad

</I>&gt;<i>With a Titanium here, and an Aluminum, I can compare a couple of these installation/removal changes. And it's no wonder certain processes void the warranty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Take the keyboards: The Titanium's keyboard can be removed by a child.  The Aluminum requires removal of the bottom case, and that's just for starters. It is an unbelievably complex maneuver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Meanwhile, I put an Airport Extreme card in the Al-Book. That was about on the level of say, putting a credit card in an ATM. Trivial. So, I decided to donate my old, unused Airport card, in the Titanium Powerbook, to a needy fellow. I figured why not? I have the tools, it can't be that bad...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I know a lot of the folks here could probably do this little job in their sleep, but it's been 27 years since I was troubleshooting the hardware innards of mainframes and what used to be called, 'minis', and to be honest, modular replacements were a lot easier then...everything was a lot bigger, and simpler. &lt;laughs&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Now I get to tell a low-budget chinese foreign exchange student, &quot;Sorry, i'm too stupid to get the card out without putting the 'book' in jeopardy.&quot; (which I cannot risk, for other reasons). What a mess.
