I should've mentioned another issue with introduction of a dual core  
32-bit processor in the PowerBook - marketing strategy.  It'd be sort  
of &quot;egg in face&quot; if they released a dual core 32-bit processor that  
benchmarks better than the G5.  It would have to designated G6 or  
something, and then there's the issue with their business  
relationship with IBM.

I don't see that happening because I don't see Freescale selling  
Apple those dual core chips at any reasonable price.  If Apple bought  
all their chips from one supplier (say Freescale), then I think the  
story would be different.  But Freescale is busy cranking out those  
chips for the embedded, automotive, communications and controller  
industries, and Apple would've had to be in talks with them at least  
a year ago in order to get chips now.  I highly doubt that ever  
happened.  You just can't walk in the door at Freescale and say &quot;guys  
I want 500,000 dual core chips and I want them tomorrow&quot;.  Apple has  
been in bed with IBM and trying to forget they were ever married to  
Motorola.
