<PRE>I believe that a number of business analysts and reporters log into  
these lists and Mac fora, so we should endeavor to keep our  
communications logical and hold off on feelings and acrimony if  
possible. Right now, I believe that the analysts and saying that the  
mac community is &quot;confused&quot; about this change.

For my own part, I agree with that analysis. I hate the idea that we  
are now on the same ship as Microsoft - it's everything we've stood  
up against in supporting this technology platform - However - I like  
what SJ said -- that we must remember that Intel created the  
microprocessor - and that things change.

With a a little perspective, I don't really care what engine I have  
running my computer, I just want my computer a) to work, and b) to be  
fun.

I've used just about every Apple computer and every Windows OS. I've  
never met a windows user who have said that their computer is fun to  
use. To most mere mortals, it's a necessary evil.


Yesterday, a friend was here. He is a Windows user as he doesn't know  
any better. He has been terrified of digital photography. The stories  
about downloading pictures into a PC that he has heard are keeping  
him from getting into it - he is a photographer. So - we took his new  
digital camera out of the box, took a dozen pictures, then took it to  
my powerbook.

I plugged in his camera to my USB cable. iPhoto started  
automatically, recognized his camera, told us we had 15 pictures to  
import and flashed the import button. We clicked it and the pictures  
downloaded. He was amazed and asked where can I buy a mac.

That's what's important to me. That kind of functionality. If that  
happens faster with a new chip running, I'm all for it. Even if it's  
Intel.
