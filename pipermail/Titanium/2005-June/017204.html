<PRE>hi flipper,

thanx for your reply .... i know ffmpegX and used to use it a lot ...  
and i have MPEGworks too (which uses the same mencoder i think)  
wasn't it just a GUI wrapper ? anyways ..these apps never really did  
it for me ... i think cleaner is the most professional os them. i  
couldn't get my hands on the main concept yet, but i will look out  
for it ...
what exactly do you do in cleaner? do you convert into DV and  
reencode into NTSC? maybe you could export the settinbgs and mail  
them? (if possible) ....btw, tell me if i am getting a pain hehehehe ...

i found this here too: <A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jeschot/home.html#DEI">http://www.xs4all.nl/~jeschot/home.html#DEI</A>
it does a fabulous job i think.... well, as far as i can tell on the  
mac - gotta get the picture on tv still ... and i think this guy who  
wrote the app thought very well what he did ..... it is also  
available on versiontracker, but so small - shouldn't be a problem to  
download from the developer site.
check it out :) ......the video cleaner is also very nice (same page)

so i think that solved my problem - still interested in your cleaner  
process though!

</I>&gt;<i> too, it'll turn a PAL-based avi of 650MBs into 4.5 Gigs before you  
</I>&gt;<i> know it)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a couple of alternatives (several): ffmpegX, Main Concept  
</I>&gt;<i> Encoder, and MPEG2 Works version 4.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ffmpegX is a terrific app, but the PAL/NTSC conversion is not its  
</I>&gt;<i> strong suit. (there are audio/video sync probs there)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Main Concept is great. it's also $250 US. And it does batch  
</I>&gt;<i> conversions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MPEG2Works does amazing PAL/NTSC (both ways) conversions, and is  
</I>&gt;<i> nearly perfect where synced audio/video is concerned. It is 30%  
</I>&gt;<i> slower (on average) than Main Concept (not a bad tradeoff for the  
</I>&gt;<i> sync quality) and it is ten times cheaper: $25.  &lt;--the winner
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of these will join avi files (I think it's on the Tools tab in  
</I>&gt;<i> ffmpegX) but there's another 20 dollar shareware app that is the  
</I>&gt;<i> great joiner, and that is JFUSE ( <A HREF="http://jfuse.com">http://jfuse.com</A> ) and it'll join  
</I>&gt;<i> multiple files as opposed to ffmpegX's max of two at a time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are other unix-based joiners out there, but they rarely work  
</I>&gt;<i> in terms that QuickTime (for example) can process properly (for  
</I>&gt;<i> playback) . You'll see a huge MB-sized file, a QT icon, but the  
</I>&gt;<i> playback halts after what would have been the first 'segment'.... a  
</I>&gt;<i> no go. With JFUSE it's just select, join, showtime. Period.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, JFUSE to join, MPEG2Works4 to process the conversion.  
</I>&gt;<i> MPEG2Works still supports several previous versions, so no matter  
</I>&gt;<i> how old the Titanium, or which OS, there's one out there. My  
</I>&gt;<i> advice: get the latest, unless you work in OS 9.
