&gt;<i> As a follow up:   Gary Krakow at MSNBC wrote an article:   Apple Switch great

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Uh no...sorry Gare.
</I>
Krakow should step away from the pipe.

&gt;<i> While Apple's chip switch may be good news for Mac users, it's even better
</I>&gt;<i> for PC users who should now finally get a chance to run Apple&#185;s terrific
</I>&gt;<i> operating system, now even better with version 10.4.1.
</I>
How does that follow? How will PC users be able to run OS X 10.4.1?

He's intimating it will run on a PC you can buy at CompUSA today.

&gt;<i> What I&#185;m surprised about is why it hasn&#185;t been done sooner. Since OS X is
</I>&gt;<i> based on UNIX &#139;and many other Unix-based operating systems work on Intel PCs
</I>&gt;<i> (Linux, for instance), you would think OS X would be a snap to port to PCs.
</I>
Really? Does he think it's that easy?

&gt;<i> But, I&#185;ve always wondered whether there was some unspoken agreement about
</I>&gt;<i> Apple not marketing OS X to work on PCs in return for something from
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft.
</I>
What? That doesn't even make any sense.

&gt;<i>  Maybe it was in return for the loan when Steve Jobs came back to
</I>&gt;<i> Apple. 
</I>
Moron. It wasn't a &quot;loan&quot;. It was an investment in Apple stock that paid of
handsomely for MS.

&gt;<i> Maybe it has something to do with Microsoft continuing to update
</I>&gt;<i> Office for Macs.
</I>
Maybe the fact that MS makes a metric buttload of money off Office for Macs
has more to do with it?

&gt;<i> (And yes, MSNBC is a Microsoft &#173; NBC joint venture. But I have no inside
</I>&gt;<i> information; I'm just speculating.)
</I>
He has no information period.

&gt;<i> Apple has announced what they call a &#179;Developer Transition Kit,&#178; which
</I>&gt;<i> includes a preview edition of OS X 10.4.1 for Intel processors and a 3.6 GHz
</I>&gt;<i> Pentium 4 PC and development tools.  This is for registered developers only
</I>&gt;<i> so they can begin to prepare applications which will run on both PowerPC and
</I>&gt;<i> Intel-based Macs.
</I>
No, it's not. I'm a &quot;registered developer&quot; (you can be one too - it's free
to sign up) and I can't &quot;rent&quot; one of those machines.

&gt;<i> On the other hand, analysts might be correct when they say another major
</I>&gt;<i> transition may be one too many for Apple.
</I>
And we all know how correct analysts are when it comes to Apple.

&gt;<i> First there was the transition
</I>&gt;<i> from 68K to PowerPC processors. Then OS 9 to OS X.  Each time, it has been
</I>&gt;<i> pointed out, Apple has lost market share.
</I>
Perfect example. Show us the facts, Krakow.

&gt;<i> Whatever happens, future use of Intel chips could mean that Apple&#185;s hardware
</I>&gt;<i> prices could be lowered &#139; and that&#185;s a good thing for everyone.
</I>
There's no indication of that whatsoever.

&gt;<i> Expect more battles ahead.
</I>
I'd settle for better writing.
