LMAO Dude...it's &quot;I've&quot; got more class than that.&quot;

Happy to help.

&gt;<i> My whole point has been, and I believe I've presented it without any

</I>&gt;<i> everybody.
</I>
No one said it would. I don't recall anyone on *any* list I'm on claim it's
going to be all sunshine and roses. But it's also not doom and gloom
*community wide*.

Will some customers be upset? Sure? Will Apple lose some customers? Sure. Do
I believe Apple is doing this because Apple believes this is in *Apple's*
best interests? Damn right.
 
&gt;<i> If they were really interested in building the
</I>&gt;<i> best computers for their customers they wouldn't be throwing all their
</I>&gt;<i> eggs in the Intel basket
</I>
Why not? They had all their eggs in the IBM basket?

&gt;<i> I don't care if a PowerMac G6
</I>&gt;<i> costs $7,000. 
</I>
You can't be serious. Apple is a long way away from the days when they could
charge huge premiums on their machines. Apple is much more in tune with
market realities - *that's* what drives the company more often than not -
not, &quot;Let's build the biggest, baddest machine we can and sell it for 100%
more than any comparable PC! They'll buy it! They're *Mac users* and they
love us!&quot; Not gonna happen.

&gt;<i> They're not doing it, so
</I>&gt;<i> they're going to loose some customers.
</I>
Certainly - but they will also gain customers.

&gt;<i> I was told offlist to not let the cpu hit me in the ass on the way out.
</I>&gt;<i> That certainly sounds like a formula for success for Apple Computer,
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't you say?
</I>
If you think Apple is on the way out, sure. But not many of us do.
