<PRE>I just wanted to take a minute to reply to a couple messages I  
received about Titanium list and respond so everyone could see them.

There are those who suggest that Titanium list is dead if we restrict  
the discussion to Apple's Titanium computers. This topic has come up  
a number of times and I can certainly understand the sentiment.

We've run into this same discussion a number of times over the course  
of the years. Our first email list was DuoList and when we created  
Titanuim, there were those who thought we should include everything  
into Duo List. It is now 7 years later and DuoList is still a strong  
community (about half the size of Titanium).

We have created PowerBook list which is exactly the place for general  
discussions of PowerBooks including discussions about what the new  
Intel PowerBooks would look like.
&lt;<A HREF="../../../../www.themacintoshguy.com/lists/PowerBook.html">http://www.themacintoshguy.com/lists/PowerBook.html</A>&gt;

I really do value the community that you have all helped to build  
here and I'm hoping that many of you will be willing to join other  
lists where the topic is more relevant to the type of discussion that  
so many value here.

Please take the time to look at some of the other lists and see where  
you might want to join in the discussions.

&lt;<A HREF="../../../../www.themacintoshguy.com/lists/index.html">http://www.themacintoshguy.com/lists/</A>&gt;

If it makes sense, I'd be happy to send subscription invitations to  
PowerBook list to everyone on Titanium if it would help make the  
transition easier.

Thank you for your support and help.
