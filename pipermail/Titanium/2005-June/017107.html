Right.  On hardware not specifically made for OS X and x86 Darwin is  
not OS X although they share much in common.  And x86 Darwin today is  
definitely not the same as a released version of OS X for Intel  
within the next 6 to 12 months.

You love those grand pronouncements, don't you?  Does it make you  
feel all superior to just *know* that you're the smartest one in the  
room and everyone else is completely and utterly wrong?

Although there has been a version of OS X for Intel from the  
beginning, it has never been their primary focus.  Do you seriously  
believe that Apple won't be working on improvements to OS X on Intel  
in the months ahead?

Oh, and the AnandTech article was talking about OS X's server  
performance on the G5 not being as good as Linux on Intel.  I'll let  
you in on a little secret... for most average users, the way that the  
OS performs in a server setting has little impact on their lives.

Apple's future lies in having acceptable performance of OS X for  
Intel for the majority of their users.  Will there be some with  
specialized needs for whom the G5 will probably work better?  Yes.   
They've got 2 years to come up with acceptable Intel hardware for  
those users, although the PPC hardware that you can buy at the end of  
those two years will probably serve you well for some time after  
that, and I'd fully expect most apps to be FAT for quite awhile after  
that.
