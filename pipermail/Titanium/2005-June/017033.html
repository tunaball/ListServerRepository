Well...you know? I've been a very loyal Apple customer since Apple ][ + in
1980. through 3 Mac 68Ks, a PPC (7100), G3 and 2 Ti (800 and 1Ghz).

America has been about change - for the better (build a better
mousetrap...)and while you are insisting that this is &quot;a clearly boneheaded
move&quot;, I don't share your view. I think that Apple was misguided by
limiting itself to the 970 and all those PPC CPUs, and that now the true
power of the Mac OS will come to light  - it does NOT need &quot;better
hardware&quot; than the Windows OS - it's better on the SAME hardware! Want to
create KILLER computers selling at $10,000? Go ahead - find a willing
customer base and build 970-based puters/servers etc or maybe AMD64-based
puters. For the rest of us - these are very promising times! For the first
time in a LONG time, the silly notion that 3% of the market is enough
because we're &quot;OH SO GREAT&quot; has been dropped! And now the promise of
increased market share, with a greater # of developers writing/porting all
those applications that so many LOYAL people like myself could NOT get on
the Mac because developers OTHER than you and Chris would NOT write them
for us, is finally a realistic possibility!! 

I don't know what kind of applications you and Chris are writing, but I DO
know that in the 2 fields in which I'm working NOT A SINGLE APPLICATION HAS
BEEN AVAILABLE FOR THE MAC! Do you fathom that, John and Chris?? Know what
it's like to go to a convention and be laughed at for still using a Mac? Do
you care at all about what OTHER equally loyal Mac users had to go through,
or is it all about you, you and YOU???
