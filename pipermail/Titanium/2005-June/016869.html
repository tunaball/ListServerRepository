Fine, let 'em.  They wouldn't have bought a PPC Mac either.

The vast majority are going to want a computer they can sit down at  
and use, not hack the firmware and hope that they don't need drivers.

When I used a Wintel machine, I didn't want the cheapest thing I  
could find.  I got a Dell because it had the best reputation for  
&quot;just working&quot; in the Wintel world.  And 5 years later, it's still  
working, running Windows XP.  Some flakiness, sure, but not  
surprising for a portable machine that was &quot;ported&quot; around a lot.

When I wanted a better OS, I tried the free version (FreeBSD and  
Linux).  It took too much time and effort just to get the thing up  
and running.  So I bought a Mac.

When I wanted to do video editing, I looked around and decided that a  
Dual G5 was probably my best bet... and that's still true today as  
much as it was 2 days ago.  So I may still buy one.  Did the  
announcement give me pause?  Sure, but no more so than wondering when  
the G6 was going to come out (which I figured was planned in the next  
year or two).


The really interesting thing will be to see how easy or difficult  
Apple makes it to dual boot Windows, and whether or not VirtualPC  
will be ported (imagine running VPC inside Rosetta!  Eeek!)
