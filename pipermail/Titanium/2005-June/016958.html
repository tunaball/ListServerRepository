<PRE>Chris,

I'm definitely NOT one of the folks for whom Apple can do no wrong, but 
I think for once Apple did the RIGHT thing this time!

 From reading your posts I am struck by your repeated referral to the 
&quot;970FX&quot; as though that, and ONLY that is what makes the Mac great. I beg 
to differ! The 970FX may be great, but the greatness of the Mac is in 
it's philosophy as embodied in its OS. This OS can be made to run on ANY 
CPU, and I say that it will beat Windows when running on the SAME CPU. 
If you say that it does NOT, and needs special CPUs - then you are 
saying that it is INFERIOR to Windows. I'll save all my analogies here 
for the next post, should this point not get through.

Now, you are actually the one asking Apple to put ALL its eggs into ONE 
basket AND price itself WAYYYYY out of the market ($7,000...? 
REALLY!!!). This is the kind of dangerous thinking that prevailed at 
Apple until now, and has proven to be disastrous in terms of BOTH market 
share and functionality! You may be a very talented developer, but there 
were many MORE developers out there writing for the Wintel platform than 
for the Mac, and the sad fact was that we had to constantly look at the 
PC side and see that there were many more applications there, while 
feeling like beggars - hoping for &quot;a handout&quot;, that they and also 
software giants like Adobe and others (previously Mac-only writers) 
would be kind enough to  port their programs to the Mac-side...and 
update them too..

I hope that now all those developers for the PC would write for the Mac, 
that its market share (a concept which you seem to equate with 
mediocrity, for some reason) would rise to the double digits and stand 
on it's own 2 legs!

Best,

Henry




&gt;<i> I stated it in another post, but this is not about Apple building the 
</I>&gt;<i> best computers for their customers, because if it was they'd be 
</I>&gt;<i> covering all the bases.  If they were really interested in building 
</I>&gt;<i> the best computers for their customers they wouldn't be throwing all 
</I>&gt;<i> their eggs in the Intel basket and they'd license that Power6 
</I>&gt;<i> technology from IBM - use the 970FX as a stepping stone.  I don't care 
</I>&gt;<i> if a PowerMac G6 costs $7,000.  It'll be worth it because it can do 
</I>&gt;<i> what no Intel machine can do running the software that some of us have 
</I>&gt;<i> developed and purchased for 64-bit Mac OS X on PowerPC.  They're not 
</I>&gt;<i> doing it, so they're going to loose some customers.  We'll port to 
</I>&gt;<i> 64-bit PowerPC linux which is every bit as robust and scalable as Mac 
</I>&gt;<i> OS X, and we'll run it on IBM BladeCenter JS20's.  I really didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> want to leave Mac OS X because it's a great operating system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was told offlist to not let the cpu hit me in the ass on the way 
</I>&gt;<i> out.  That certainly sounds like a formula for success for Apple 
</I>&gt;<i> Computer, wouldn't you say?
</I>&gt;<i> --
