Yes, we checked, swapping cables too.

The IP numbers (address, router, dns server) was fine, 
but the subnet mask was not what I thought it should

worked for the last 2.5 years..

This could have been part of the problem. The Ethernet cable
going into my laptop is not high quality (to say the least).
I was fiddling with the port alot by the end of the evening.

The problem, as near as I can tell, was that somehow a mismatch
occured between the Ethernet address on my computer and what the
network people were using for the Ethernet address
attached to my IP node. 

You see the network here is not only firewalled, each IP
is fixed to one computer that the LAN recognizes in its 
database. The reason for this was that in the past some
pranksters(?) were spamming from within the LAN (and our 
network was getting break-ins from without at the same time),
therefore one cannot, say, plug in different computers to connect 
another computer to a specific IP address, only one computer
is allowed. Initially though, the LAN software must 'open' up the 
Port, and grab the Ethernet address from the computer (or an 
operator can type it into the database), then it 'locks' the 
port/IP to that computer.

So then through the process of 'opening' and 'closing'
the port a few times, something got set in the proper way.
And that is as far as I know what caused that problem. 
A big relief, for me, that it was not hardware. I'm 
so dependent on this laptop.. 

Thanks for the good advice and suggestions!

Amara
