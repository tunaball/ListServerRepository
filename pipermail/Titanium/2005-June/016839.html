I'm too old to feel like this, but mature (I guess) enough to admit 
it, but I was heartsick last night when i got home from work.

It struck me that Jobs is a simple bald-faced liar, and when I popped 
on the Aluminum, and booted Tiger, I had this eerie, dreadful feeling 
that i was looking at OS 9, again. You know, as in 'doomed'.

Chris, although way off-topic, a year ago you mentioned some 
scenarios, or ideas, that i might want to pursu, in order to bring an 
old Titanium 667 back to life.

(The Ti in question has a fried Firewire port, no keyboard, a 
demolished Combo drive)

I'm on a one-year old Aluminum (which i guard with my life, and runs 
and looks brand new, i want to add)... but...

Now that i have a machine for day-to-day, and 'turnaround' isn't an 
issue, what are my options?

A mobo swap 'up', to a 1 gig board, even remotely possible? (I know 
the deal on keyboards and Combo drives, pretty trivial in comparison.)

Is there a 'market' in parts for the items I will need? I made a vow 
not to send a nickel to Apple, so third-party everything is the order 
of the day.

Thanks, and sorry for the stray from the 'sad' topic.
