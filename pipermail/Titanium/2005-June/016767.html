Chris...

Just like the fantasy of selling iPods to the PC crowd...a &quot;small and 
insignificant minority of 90%&quot;? Or porting iTunes to the PC platform?

I don't know why you get all riled up - I think that the wider the 
audience for the Mac OS - the BETTER it would be for all.

Is the current Mac that superior? Are there NO bugs in Tiger or in the 
hardware of the G5? Even Marconi himself (who got upset at me a few yrs 
ago for what he perceived to be heretic thoughts in questioning the 
perfection of the Mac) is now openly criticizing the 10.4 OS...

Computers are NOT static, and **reasonable** hardware and software 
decisions have to be made on an ongoing basis so that the Mac (and The 
Apple Computer Company) will continue to survive. If there's something 
good out there in the PC world - why not bring it into the Mac and make 
it better as well as increase its market share?

Come back to earth, Chris, and let's all work on getting the best Mac we 
can get  on an ongoing basis.

Best,

Henry
