It's feeling a bit chilly - excerpted from the Wall Street Journal:

Apple Eyes Shifting
  Macintosh Line
  To Intel Chips

By DON CLARK and NICK WINGFIELD
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
June&#160;4,&#160;2005&#160;5:04&#160;p.m.


SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple Computer Inc. is expected to announce Monday 
that it will begin shifting its Macintosh computer line next year to 
Intel Corp. chips, people familiar with the situation said.

The move is a major change in strategy by Apple, a high-profile win for 
Intel, and a potential blow to International Business Machines Corp. 
and Freescale Semiconductor Inc., suppliers of the PowerPC chips that 
Apple has long used in its Macintosh systems.

Apple's decision, which comes after years of industry speculation and 
behind-the-scenes lobbying by Intel, could cause disruptions for users 
of the Macintosh. Among other things, application programs will have to 
be adapted to run on Intel's x86 chips, the calculating engines used in 
most personal computers that run Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating 
system.

Steve Jobs, Apple's chief-executive and co-founder, is expected to 
explain the shift Monday during a keynote speech to attendees at the 
company's annual conference for software developers in San Francisco, 
the people familiar with the situation said.

The Wall Street Journal reported on May 23 that the companies were in 
talks that could lead to Apple adopting Intel microprocessors. The 
article reported that two industry executives with knowledge of recent 
discussions between the companies said Apple will agree to use Intel 
chips, and indicated that the announcement could come as soon at the 
Monday, June 6 conference.

CNET on Friday reported that Apple would announce the transition plan 
June 6. It reported that Apple would move lower-end computers such as 
the Mac Mini to Intel chips in mid-2006 and higher-end models such as 
the Power Mac in mid-2007. An industry executive familiar with the 
matter, contacted Saturday, verified that schedule.

Spokesmen for Apple, Intel, IBM and Freescale said their companies had 
no comment. At a recent technology conference hosted by the Wall Street 
Journal, Mr. Otellini described the idea of supplying microprocessors 
to Apple as &quot;the Haley's comet of rumors,&quot; because of its frequent 
recurrence over the years.
