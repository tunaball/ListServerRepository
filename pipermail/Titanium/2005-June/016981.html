<PRE>I am dealing with this turn of events by assuming that IBM was the  
problem, which is just speculation, but to me makes the most sense.   
It wasn't that IBM couldn't make the next generation of chips for  
Apple, they just decided gaming consoles was the best use of their  
resources. They told Apple they wouldn't be advancing the state of  
the art in PPC for computers.  Apple decided they couldn't re-write/ 
port OS X to the chips the gaming consoles use.

Does it suck that PPC/64-bit/G5 is fading away? Of Course.  Is there  
developer worry?  Sure.

Did Apple have any other viable choice?  I don't think so.

Will Apple survive?  Most definitely.

Will I purchase another Mac?  Yup.  Windoze is gross.  Ewww.

I ask you this: What would WWDC been like if Steve came out and said  
that G5 development had stalled, and while Macs are still twice as  
fast as PC's, we don't have a plan to solve the problem.  Knowing  
they had OS X ported to x86, what would you suggest Apple to do?  I  
think there are much worse scenarios than Macintel that could have  
arisen.

&quot;I felt something, a disturbance in the network, as if a million Mac  
zealots cried out in horror and were suddenly silenced.&quot;
