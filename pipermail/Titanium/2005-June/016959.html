Excellent thread guys, although a little heated and misdirected  
sometimes...

I just wanted to chime in with an opinion from the creative  
industry.. this is not a sweeping opinion by any means, but frankly..  
what is under the hood has ALWAYS taken back seat to what the machine  
can do 'on the street', If you follow my analogy. Frankly - I don't  
give a damn what is under the hood.. the geek side of me lusts to  
know more, because I have been an Apple Computer user since my first  
Apple II and IIc, back in 83... so the story and suspense of it all  
is quite dramatic and interesting to me.

The Mac has been a staple in our industry and many credit much of the  
&quot;success&quot; or progression of the digital design era of the past 2  
decades with the understanding that Apple really helped a lot of it  
happen (in partnerships with companies like Adobe and whatnot)

The creative ind. has always been watching the TCO closely as the  
computer is the next most important tool after our brain. The speed  
at which we can get things done is getting faster and the money we  
make from clients is greater due to more work being done. All I see  
from this deal is faster computers.. which to me indirectly  
translates to more work being done, more money being made. Good for  
everyone.

I have never connected Apple's slogan &quot;Think Different&quot; with their  
use of MOT/IBM processors. Well, maybe I have in the sense of MS  
versus Apple... Sure, you could tie the two together along with what  
Apple supplies in terms of it's OS and functionality.. it IS the  
whole package.. but in this day and age of loyalties, contracts,  
deals and the all out war in the computer industry - I would put up  
for discussion that Apple is truly &quot;Thinking Different&quot;, now -  
possibly more than ever. They finally grew the balls to make a very  
gutsy move away from a philosophy that nearly brought them down  
completely, several times over!

Aren't we allllll tired of the fact that Apple has on average been  
unfairly trounced by the PC community forever (I'm stretching there  
just to make my point obvious, I know recently things have been  
better), but I for one am extremely excited about the fact that Apple  
(to me) is moving out (or at least trying to) from behind the niche  
market that they have been pigeonholed into FOREVER due to their  
processors.

I raise my cup to the &quot;Switchers&quot; (Apple following their own words)  
and look forward to the future with more enthusiasm than ever.

Thanks for your time,
Bill Reburn, MGDC.
