<PRE>&gt;<i> the chips are any cheaper, and hopefully Apple will continue  
</I>&gt;<i> providing a nice,
</I>&gt;<i> non-whitebox computer.  Imagine a current G5 with dual Pentiums in  
</I>&gt;<i> it...the
</I>&gt;<i> differential in pricing of the chips isn't likely to equate to  
</I>&gt;<i> anything even
</I>&gt;<i> remotely substantial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
However, we know nothing about IBM's supply - if supply is limited,  
Apple has to sell the G5 at a premium because they cannot supply  
enough machines at a lower price point. Right? And at the same time,  
how plentiful are G4's compared to P IV's?

The other thing - if Apple can skip the honking big heat sinks - not  
too sure what Pentiums require - they might be able to shrink the G5  
case. That'd be nice.



&gt;<i> If Apple moves to flimsy cases, fans with 3-month
</I>&gt;<i> lifespans (not to mention LOUD),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Like the MDD fan noise a while back? Sure, they replaced the loud  
power supplies - for a fee. It took Apple a LONG time to admit the  
machines were out of spec, and loud. <A HREF="http://www.g4noise.com/">http://www.g4noise.com/</A> Granted,  
the power supply was not an Apple designed part - but they spec'd it,  
and had the opportunity to modify the case to draw air from the outside.

Or reliability, to say the least, I know from a Sys Admin that  
earlier G5's he received had terrible life issues (DOA/failure rate)  
- though they were on par with the Dell's (we're talking rollouts in  
the upper hundreds). I just got a brand new G5 2.3 that didn't even  
turn on! However, Apple was VERY good and replaced ASAP. As they should.



&gt;<i> cheap bolt-in HD brackets, impossible-to-
</I>&gt;<i> manipulate internals, etc.,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes and no... Apple's expansion systems are very well thought out,  
implemented. However, and this may be due to the G5 heat sinks/fans,  
you can only fit two HD's inside a G5 - I'm sure 3rd party brackets  
are available, but for pro Video users, an extra HD bay is a plus  
(though Firewire, yes, is easily an option). The G5 is a big case.  
Large.



&gt;<i> then I can see price drops, but hopefully that'll
</I>&gt;<i> never happen.  I absolutely love Apple's hardware design - it's  
</I>&gt;<i> well thought
</I>&gt;<i> out, robust, well-finished, practical, and pretty.  I guess I like Sun
</I>&gt;<i> workstations/servers for the same reasons... :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, the loud Ti 550 fan, paint chipping, not to mention the hinge  
design of the Ti (slim, for sure, but not user serviceable!), Airport  
reception : ) I'm not saying Windows machines are any better (in  
fact, most are really bad), but I wouldn't hold Apple up so high!  
They are getting better - the fit and finish of the Albooks are nice  
- haven't owned one, however. Dell cases (towers) are pure carp. The  
split design is awful (though it allows a lot of space to work). And  
to think Apple had it down long before Dell's wretched design!

Or the cube - cracked Acrylic. Silent, yes. Cracked, yes.

Design: Yes!!!!

Robust:  Mostly

Don't get me wrong - I buy live and suggest Apple. I just find it  
difficult to say their products are robust.
