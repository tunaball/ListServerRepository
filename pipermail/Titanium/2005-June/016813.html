<PRE>Well said.  Thank you for articulating this so well.

When Apple moved to IBM from Motorola, I was very happy because  
Motorola wasn't able (or willing) to commit the resources to give Apple  
what it needed to compete.  I had high hopes for the Apple/IBM  
alliance.  The G5 is a brilliant technology that should have performed  
better.  Now we see that IBM had other priorities, too.  Being a closet  
conspiracy theorist, I have to wonder if Microsoft chose IBM to supply  
processors for its next X-Box not only because it had a good processor,  
but also to mess with Apple.  Still in all, I love the two G5 2.5 GHz  
DP Macs that I use at work.  I also love the iMac G5 2.0 GHz 20&quot; that I  
just bought for home.  Even with today's announcement, I have no  
regrets for investing in them and I expect to continue to use them for  
many years.  They still work just as well as they did yesterday, before  
the Intel switch was announced.  That announcement doesn't change  
anything about the Mac experience.  They are great computers with an  
incredible operating system that perform well and consistently deliver  
in extreme computing environments -- 3D modeling/animation, video  
editing, hi-res photo manipulation, color management, etc.

I admit to struggling with the idea of Apple collaborating with the  
&quot;enemy.&quot;  It will take a little time to get past this.  I know that  
Intel is not the same as Microsoft, but they tended to be grouped  
together.  I agree with those who think this is a good move, but I  
still feel a loss that Apple will not be using RISC processors.  Maybe  
the distinction between RISC and CISC is not as well defined or  
relevant any longer, I don't know.  I'm not a hardware guy as much as a  
graphic designer who enjoys the superiority of my tools.  Still RISC  
processors is part of what made Macs special compared to the mediocre  
stuff generically known as PCs or Wintel boxes.

When this news hits the media, there will be a lot of misinformation.   
I'm waiting for the first person to ask me about running MacOS X on  
their homebuilt PC.  I hope that will never happen.  I don't want the  
MacOS to try to be all things to all computer hardware.  That's what  
sucks about Windows.  Let's hope Apple keeps the Mac a Lexus compared  
to all the PC Chevys out there.

Apple is not a computer, it's not a chip or even a platform.&#160; Apple is  
a group of designers, engineers, developers and users who have always  
danced on the bleeding edge of technology and have been doing so since  
the late 1970's.&#160; That will not change.&#160; The common denominator is we  
are &quot;extreme&quot; computer users.&#160; We love being extreme; being ~3% of the  
market.&#160; Why?&#160; Because our computers are the most stable out there.&#160;  
They have been and will continue to be a thing of beauty...and we  
marvel at the beauty.

  Jobs and the kids were held hostage by IBM market forces.&#160; The writing  
was on the wall when XBox and other game platforms based their systems  
on the same IBM chip.&#160; Apple was elbowed out.

  I, for one, am going to look to the future BECAUSE of the past.&#160; PC's  
will continue to suck.&#160; Their OS will continue to be unstable.&#160; And  
they will still want to be Macs.

  The people in charge at Apple made a move today that gives a future  
back to Apple Computer.&#160; Brilliant really, think about it.&#160; The real  
question is how many of us &quot;users&quot; and &quot;developers&quot; are going to be a  
part in building this future.

  Well count me in.&#160; I transition out of computers every two years.&#160; In  
fact tomorrow I a purchasing a 15&quot; aluminum for my daughter.&#160; You can  
call that stupid, or you can think of it like I do...investing into the  
future of &quot;extreme&quot; computing.&#160; Long live Apple.
