</I>
Ditto for this one - what's the problem here? Is the Mac OS X etched in 
stone or something?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those x86 dev boxes are not there to only make sure your app *runs* on

</I>&gt;<i> If similar functionality (in your app) is available on Windows or

</I>&gt;<i> performance doing the same task, you won't be able to sell your app 
</I>&gt;<i> because the mainstream media will benchmark it and label it a &quot;dog&quot;.
</I>
So - the Mac OS is a &quot;lame dog&quot; that requires the wonders of the PPC 
chip to stand up to Windows and Linux?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The performance comparisons between the dev boxes and current PowerPC 
</I>&gt;<i> are very real folks, because you're dealing with current-production 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware on both archs.  What ever performance increases come down the 
</I>&gt;<i> pipeline on the x86 side will also be enjoyed by x86 linux and 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, making the idea that &quot;shipping&quot; boxes are going to perform 
</I>&gt;<i> better than the dev boxes a moot point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>And Apple hasn't thought about all this (again - assuming your above 
contentions are true)?

Chris - I'm just an end user, 's all. I don't own stock in any computer 
company, nor have any financial interest in any. I only own and use the 
Ti and G3 at the moment. Now, at the various talks that I attend in my 
own profession, the speakers are required to disclose any potential 
conflict of interest - that is - if you're talking about  say Prozac's 
wonderful effects, you should reveal that you have been given a grant by 
Eli Lilly and Co (makers of Prozac, the patent for which has or is now 
expiring) so that people would be able to understand your possible lack 
of objectivity as regards this product. Can I ask you for something 
similar here? Where are you coming from? What products are you 
selling/developing? You seem to have an agenda that far transends a 
regular user's one (like myself). What gives, Chris???
