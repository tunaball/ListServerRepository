And the majority on this list seem to believe that if this was better 
for Mac users and their futures, that Apple would have gone this 
route. Apple is taking a bit of a gamble with their own bank account 
to make this switch.

&gt;<i>My whole point has been, and I believe I've presented it without any 
</I>&gt;<i>personal attacks, that this &quot;transition&quot; is not going to work for 
</I>&gt;<i>everybody.
</I>
And as has been said, if it works for you great. If another platform 
will work better for you, then you are free to jump ship. But 
throwing about your upset feelings on this list isn't going to change 
anything.

&gt;<i>I stated it in another post, but this is not about Apple building 
</I>&gt;<i>the best computers for their customers, because if it was they'd be 
</I>&gt;<i>covering all the bases.  If they were really interested in building 
</I>&gt;<i>the best computers for their customers they wouldn't be throwing all 
</I>&gt;<i>their eggs in the Intel basket and they'd license that Power6 
</I>&gt;<i>technology from IBM - use the 970FX as a stepping stone.  I don't 
</I>&gt;<i>care if a PowerMac G6 costs $7,000.  It'll be worth it because it 
</I>&gt;<i>can do what no Intel machine can do running the software that some 
</I>&gt;<i>of us have developed and purchased for 64-bit Mac OS X on PowerPC.
</I>
It is not all about what you have done in the past to then provide 
the answers for what others should do in the future. If you think 
that the Power6 technology is all that much of a sure thing, you are 
free in any world that I know of to get all of your friends together 
and make this wonderful computer and then sell it for gobs of money. 
Until you have the following that others have, you will have to 
follow.

&gt;<i>They're not doing it, so they're going to loose some customers.
</I>
That would be lose and some customers Apple may choose to lose and 
I'll say good riddance if they leave.

&gt;<i>   We'll port to 64-bit PowerPC linux which is every bit as robust 
</I>&gt;<i>and scalable as Mac OS X, and we'll run it on IBM BladeCenter 
</I>&gt;<i>JS20's.  I really didn't want to leave Mac OS X because it's a great 
</I>&gt;<i>operating system.
</I>
I guess life is all about choices. We don't seem to get everything we 
want. For you it will be choose your processor or choose your OS. You 
don't get anything you want just cuz you want it.

The day Microsoft makes something that doesn't suck is the day they start making vacuum cleaners.
