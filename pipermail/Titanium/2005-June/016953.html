Dude, really... you make it sound like Steve personally strangled  
your kittens or your grandma... In business, plans change... I'm  
amused that everyone things that Intel will never get 64-bit right  
because their initial efforts failed.  Hell, that Pentium thing never  
caught on after the initial floating-point problems, right?

But mostly the idea that any of this has been &quot;on a whim&quot; is ridiculous.

If anything, they've been patient waiting for IBM to produce.  FIVE  
YEARS they've held this card &quot;just in case&quot;.  TWO YEARS to deliver a  
3.0 GHz G5.

Seems like a remarkable amount of patience and forethought went into  
this.

The fact is you don't know what went on behind the scenes and are  
making all these assumptions about the past, present and future.

Apple, on the other hand, knows what went on behind the scenes.   
Steve Jobs, who has been right about more things than he's been wrong  
about, knows what went on behind the scenes.  He knows what IBM was  
saying they could deliver in the future, and what Intel said they can  
deliver in the future.

I find it very difficult to believe that the importance of 64-bit has  
been completely lost on the people who made the arguments in the  
first place.
