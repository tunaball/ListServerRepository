No - that would be Avie Tevanian.

I never compared your swearing to anyone else.

OK.
 
&gt;<i> One thing about mailing lists; for anybody who's only capable of

</I>
Isn't it though?

&gt;<i> Maybe someday you'll escape the effects of the Jobs Reality Distortion
</I>&gt;<i> Field and realize Apple Computer has lied to, mislead, deceived,
</I>&gt;<i> whatever you want to call it - their customers.  You think I'm alone?
</I>&gt;<i> Hah!  What us migrate off the Mac en masse.
</I>
Buh bye. Don't let the CPU hit you in the ass on the way out.

&gt;<i> Now that the Mac has
</I>&gt;<i> become nothing but a PC with an Apple logo on it, only the die-hards
</I>&gt;<i> are going to be left.
</I>
That's right. No one else. Just us chickens....

&gt;<i>  And don't sit there smug with some line that
</I>&gt;<i> Apple will protect the platform so it'll only run on a Mac.
</I>
I said no such thing.

&gt;<i> To do so 
</I>&gt;<i> only displays stupidity.  The open source guys will have Intel OS X
</I>&gt;<i> running on a Dell in no time flat.  They're *experts* at
</I>&gt;<i> reverse-engineering things like that, just like iTunes DRM was easily
</I>&gt;<i> broken, and every time Apple patches the hole Jon has a new release of
</I>&gt;<i> the libs out within a day and it's cracked again.
</I>
And the vast majority of people don't care and don't bother.

&gt;<i> Apple's success has been serving a niche market that has the money -
</I>&gt;<i> not the commodity market.  They just lost their high-end market -
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise, servers, scientific, data analysis, etc..
</I>
How do you figure that? There are no Intel machines in the high end? Apple
can't sell their MacIntel machines running OS X to the high end?

&gt;<i> Your statement 
</I>&gt;<i> that IBM couldn't deliver the chips Apple wants only illustrates your
</I>&gt;<i> total ignorance of the industry.
</I>
No - it demonstrates that I've been paying attention the past few years.
Where is the 3Gig G5 IBM promised Apple and Apple promised us, among other
things?

&gt;<i> IBM can easily put a 64-bit Power chip in a PowerBook
</I>
Of course they can. I never said they couldn't. But it sure as heck wouldn't
be as small, light and (relatively) cool as a present G4 AiBook.

&gt;<i> - the Xbox 360 is living proof with a triple core
</I>&gt;<i> PowerPC chip - the IBM Blade servers that are thinner than an Xserve,
</I>&gt;<i> with dual core Power5's are living proof.  Apple didn't want to pay IBM
</I>&gt;<i> what those chips are worth and didn't think they should use some of
</I>&gt;<i> their profits for chip development with IBM - therefore they lost their
</I>&gt;<i> niche market that has been so successful to them by switching to a
</I>&gt;<i> commodity chip.
</I>
And, if that were the case, I'd say they made a wise move.

&gt;<i> I'm off the Ti list - I got much better things to do than listen to
</I>&gt;<i> your personal insults on the list.  I never did that to you.  I
</I>&gt;<i> expected the same in return.  You're not the frickin' list moderator.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe someday you'll wake up.  But I doubt it.
</I>
Thanks.
