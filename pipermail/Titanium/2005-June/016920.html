When Apple moved from the old 65000 CPU series, everyone complained 
about it for a bit, but the chipsets we were provided with in newer 
Macs actually ended up being pretty darned good.  When Apple moved from 
the old version of the OS to OS X, everyone screamed and ranted and 
raved about it (and I know of people who will never move off OS 9.2.2), 
but in the end, it all ended up being pretty darned good.
//sarcasm_on
Now this next major development - *GASP* Intel chipsets in a Mac??? 
***SHUDDER***  It just CAN'T be!!!
//sarcasm_off

It appears to me that one of the biggest single factors in Apple's 
decision to change CPUs was availability in sufficient quantity to meet 
the needs of manufacturing (after reading all the data here and other 
places).  I, for one, will take the same attitude I've always taken - 
wait and see - since the decision to move was made by people who 
analyze this stuff for a living.  If Apple intends on continuing with 
the 64-bit stand, and Intel is in the mix, I'm reasonably certain 
there's some stuff going on in the background that we're not privy to.  
Apple is most likely NOT going to dump the OS that we've come to love 
(although they have surprised us in the past ;o).  Apple is going to 
make sure that we have the same user experience we expect from their 
products.  Apple is going to make sure they can get the necessary 
pieceparts (read: CPUs or chipsets or what have you...) to continue to 
push the envelope on leading-edge technologies and bring us new 
innovations.  We are not going to suffer en masse and run to the deadly 
M$/Windoze camp (but keep in mind, some will always find something to 
complain about, regardless of what they get).

Can we now get back to the intended purpose of this thread?  Sheesh, 
yer all getting to sound like a buncha whinin' old biddies!
