<PRE>No, not kidding.  I know the costs.  Perhaps my word choice was  
poor.  I believe that one should, like Apple for instance, make their  
APIs and devkits free to developers.  Not 3500/year for ADC  
membership.  It is my opinion that is what Apple should do; make ADC  
membership free to developers.  Especially Apple, which seems to make  
things difficult for their developers every few years or so, or,  
alienates them by copying their applications and including them in  
their OS as a feature every so often.  Also, I feel they should make  
it free because of their smaller market share.  There are many  
reasons one could argue for or against this notion.  Now, maybe you  
want to take a class, or go to WWDC, then you can pay for that.  But  
my point was, I suppose it isn't all that bad that they're charging  
1K for the Intel dev kit as it includes a computer.  I didn't know  
that it was a rental, however.  Now I don't know what to think.  I'm  
not a developer, just a lowly IT manager, so I couldn't care less.  I  
use Macs because at home I like being a user, not a sysadmin.  I  
don't want to re-compile my kernel at home, or compile my software  
from source (again, at home).  I just want it to work when I plug in  
my digital camera, or other such banal activities, and I like the  
quality of their hardware and the elegance of OS X.
