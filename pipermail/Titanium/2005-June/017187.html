<PRE>my tibook just died 4 days ago ... i wouldn't say it was because of  
heat, well i don't think it was directly the reason ....
it was running very hot - it always did during conversion from PAL to  
NTSC video format ....
i am still sad .....
anyways, i got a new iMac now (yeah!) ....and i am going to get my  
tibook fixed ...it is the logic biard, which needs to be replaced .....

what i really wanted to say is:
i had the idea to put a spare marble plate underneath the tibook -  
that worked phenomenal (i got the idea, after the breakdown of the  
display)
uhm, did i mention that i am pastry chef and therefore i had a marble  
plate (to temper chocolate) ......i think i can't focus tonight  
anymore :)

if you have a stone plate (marble, granit, preferably an inch thick)  
then that might be a solution to your problem too
