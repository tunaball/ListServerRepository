<PRE>&gt;<i>OK, so it's extremist to be extremely miffed that two years ago I 
</I>&gt;<i>was promised and handed a 64-bit dev roadmap.  And now a switch to a 
</I>&gt;<i>different cpu architecture is announced with the 64-bit part totally 
</I>&gt;<i>gone from the map for the new architecture.
</I>
Really? I missed the part of the announcement where they said 
anything even close to that.   Your assumptions are that the worst is 
going to happen. I did hear Jobs say they have more PPC products in 
the pipeline, which is the closest I have ever heard him get to 
pre-announcing any products; you will have lots of choices for years 
to come.

You (and everyone else for that matter) is speculating on what will 
happen in 2 years.  I have never seen Steve Jobs &quot;settle&quot; for 
anything and I believe what we will see from Intel for Apple will be 
amazing and very cool. Remember when Jobs pulled out the first 
wireless Powerbook at Macworld and walked around surfing the net?  Oh 
how we take wireless for granted today, but I think in 2 years we 
will see something similar in Intel processors for Mac.

The one thing that is perfectly clear: IBM is either unwilling or 
unable to deliver on the products that you are complaining about 
losing out on.  What would you say in 2007 if they still haven't hit 
the 3.0ghz?  I heard lots of grumbling about the poor speed bump in 
the last PowerMac upgrade. This was certainly not Apple's decision. 
Jobs was very diplomatic about IBM, but it is very clear that Apple 
will be taking a back seat to their development for the gaming 
platforms; in addition, IBM failed to deliver their commitment to 
Apple.

Of course, we are still in the &quot;honeymoon&quot; phase of the Intel/Apple 
marriage, but Otellini appears to genuinely excited about the 
opportunity to bring the engineering teams together. And if you look 
at what Apple engineers have done in the past, this isn't going to be 
a &quot;how can we make it work&quot; relationship, but a &quot;how can we make it 
great&quot; relationship.  I honestly believe that Otellini wants Intel to 
be as cool as Apple, and working together, they really can be.
