I have a stock Core Duo mini...

Photoshop CS (dunno about CS2) is slow to start, but once inside it  
is OK, as long as you:

1) not switch between another application and Photoshop (beachball)

2) stick to things like slicing, or droplets/actions

3) save infrequently (saving seems to take a bit)

4) crop/resize infrequently

I wouldn't really try working with a large PS file on the mini, though.

Filters - they aren't terribly slow as long as you are only doing one  
or two.


MS Office runs OK. I would have to say that Flash 2004 runs AMAZINGLY  
well, Dreamweaver 2004 is so~so (bearable as long as you code inside  
the code window).


What I find amazing, is that compared to my 867DP and a Dual 2 G5,  
the mini processes RAW Canon 20D photos (in Preview) much faster. I  
haven't timed it, but it's &quot;subjectively&quot; faster.


So... basically I wouldn't recommend a MacBook (and held off buying  
one) till CS3 comes out if one works heavily in Photoshop.

It's a shame, but I think for some applications it will help improve  
the quality of the product - ie, PS, Illustrator, may start to share  
more in common (they've both been &quot;merging&quot; features slowly). If I  
recall correctly, neither are Xcode based.

Anyhow, those are my two [OT] cents.
