Also my apologies for not responding earlier.

OK. As you probably know, DSL technologies run on the ordinary copper  
wire your POTS uses, and uses the high frequencies (that you can't  
normally hear) , usually above 35Khz.

However the DSL system is not perfect, partly due to the differences  
in particular DSL technologies, and mainly due to the massive  
differences in Telco wires and equipment around the country and the  
world.

So you sometimes will hear static (the DSL modem talking) , and the  
filters are there to prevent that.

My guess is that either:

1) There is a problem with the filters, try testing a different brand  
of microfilter. They are very cheap so this shouldn't be hard to do.

2) There is a problem with the interaction of the Telco equipment  
with the DSL service. For example when DSL first started many Telcos  
used a splitter outside your house that separated the voice and data  
channels. This practice was stopped because it's more expensive. You  
must talk to your Telco and explain the problem. If your cordless  
phone is not a DECT model (just a normal analogue one) they will  
probably try and blame the static on that, so be prepared to borrow a  
standard wired phone to prove that this is not the case.

The situation you are experiencing has been known to happen. I've  
heard of people having the same issue in London around 10 years ago,  
though in recent history I've not seen or heard this.

--
I'm sorry I can't be more specific (I'm no telcom expert), but you  
really must try to reach the experts in the Greek provider's support  
team. It may take time but you must persevere.

cheers,

Tarik
