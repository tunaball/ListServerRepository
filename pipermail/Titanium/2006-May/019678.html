As I understand it, 8080 is currently the ONLY port open to the  
outside world....... so that seems consistent with what you state above.
Is there any security risk for hte College if they open port 143 ?
Skype has also stopped working.  I presume that s also a port issue.
As I have reported before iChat has never worked, and I assumed that  
was also a port issue, but was never able to track it down.....

I did not know that.  Thanks.  Any idea why is there such a  
limitation ?  I have about six POP mail accounts, so I just assumed I  
could have more than 1 Exchange account.
Now I know that is not the case. Thanks.

&gt;<i> You can check on your own if you can get to the IMAP port by

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> (CDT)

</I>&gt;<i> If you get through, enter quit to disconnect. A response indicates  
</I>&gt;<i> you have a good connection path and you then need to look at  
</I>&gt;<i> authentication problems.
</I>
I can only do that from inside the College, I am presuming, as from  
here (home) I get time out from Terminal when I try it.
I will try it tomorrow, and let you know what I find.

Thanks again for such a lot of help.

regards,  Trevor
