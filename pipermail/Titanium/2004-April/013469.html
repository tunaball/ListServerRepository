<PRE>My block has outlasted two LCDs!  (Back light blew, and now the bottom 2/3 is dead). My latch is broken and the bottom shell of the titanium case is loose.  But the adapter is fine.  Yup it runs hot.  That is something I keep in mind when I am tempted to prop up the back of the PB with it.  Not a good idea to put a heat generator under the already hot processor.  I am careful to never strangulate the thing when wrapping the cord.  That is a habit I learned from using DC power adopters with the black cord that are always weak where they meet the brick/plug portion.  Battery is going strong too after two years -  it keeps a healthy charge.  

My tale of repair woe: The LCD goes bad on bottom 2/3.  I call Apple to invoke an Apple Care case and they say I am not enrolled.  They offer me a 'flat fee' repair, which means for approximately $340 they will fix anything that would be a warranty repair, if the unit was still under warranty.  This was on 10/5, and I decide to check my credit card statements 'cause I am still convinced that I DID enroll for Apple Care.  So I let a week slip by, and then am out of town and on the 20th I decide to bite the bullet and go ahead with the repair.  I call Apple and they quote me over $1,000 for the LCD.  &quot;what about the 'flat rate' repair?&quot; I ask.  They tell me they have a written policy that a quote is good for only 6 days.  I complained that I was not told of the policy, but then I decide to play along:  I ask them to quote me a 'flat rate' repair like last time...&quot;LCD is excluded from that program&quot;...&quot;But I was given that option on the fifth?!&quot;  &quot;The exclusion is a new policy, effective the tenth...&quot;  AARRGH.  

I am kicking myself about not getting Apple care and the PB is essentially a desktop now. Thought I enrolled, but I must have postponed it having just incurred the cost of upgrading to a combo drive, than confused myself into thinking I enrolled.

I am sooo tempted by the new PB series, but feel the PB case is not a durable design.  According to the literature, the iBooks  are designed to hold up better.  Now that you can get a Superdrive in an iBook, I may go that route.  Still, the 12&quot; Superdrive model has me drooling...  Or maybe, the cheapest iBook plus an eMac for larger storage, burning etc.  Anyone notice the cost of upgrading RAM in a PB versus a eMac. To upgrade to a gig you spend $700 on the PB cause you need it on one card.

Whatever laptop I get I will a) get Applecare, b)get a sleeve and keyboard/lcd protector and keep the thing as mint as possible, c) consider selling it on eBay after AppleCare expires and upgrade.  If it stays as mint as I hope, it will still have decent residual value after 3 years.

Daniel

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my opinion they generally run pretty hot.  I am on my

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lasted longer, and we should be reimbursed.  Fortunately my first 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; replacement was within my one year warranty.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Out of curiousity, who has had one of these boxes fail in

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Please reply (and with how many)... I'm curious.
