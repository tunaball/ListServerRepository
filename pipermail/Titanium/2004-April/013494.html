Should have sad &quot;still WAS convinced...&quot; because I checked my CC statements and only the combo drive charge was found, never followed up on the Apple  Care once I got the quote of its price...

The backlight went while the unit was under its 1 year warranty and apple replaced the lcd half of my Ti.  I could tell because the hinges where painted grayish/white on the new lid, as opposed to metallic paint.

The 2/3 blank problem came up after transporting the unit, no notable rough housing occurred.  Must have been 14 months old.  For a while, tapping it with the right 'english' would get the unit to refresh the entire screen, but the bottom 2/3 would not be active and would fade back to the &quot;old ink jet in the rain&quot; washed out look and be very dim.  Before this problem, I saw no problems that I can recall.
