<PRE>I have to agree with Wilson Ng on this, and I don't think he will scare 
or cause mass panic amongst those of us who travel with our TiBook.    
What he says is true, people have had their laptops stolen at the x-ray 
machine.  I am usually passing through this part of the airport on my 
own and am extra careful and never put my laptop through until it is 
all clear.  The only country that I travel to where I have to remove 
the laptop from its bag and sleeve and shove it in a plastic tray to go 
through the x-ray machine is Australia, where I then have to muck 
around putting it all together again.  Everywhere else I can leave it 
in its bag.

Most airports I travel to are not staffed by people who have English as 
their first language, and as Wilson pointed out, I would be very 
surprised if the whole place came to a stop because I yelled &quot;Stop! 
Thief!&quot;.

As far as security cameras go, by the time the staff got organised to 
check them, my TiBook would be long gone.  I don't travel to the USA so 
things might be different there.  However, here is a tip for anyone 
going to India.  A TiBook using friend who has lived there for years 
had just picked up his new 12&quot; model and was taking a rickshaw home, 
had the new laptop in a bag, along with his credit cards, passport etc, 
on the seat beside him, he glanced around at something to the side for 
a matter of seconds and when he looked back, laptop bag was gone and 
the rickshaw was moving all the time.  Luckily he had insurance to 
cover it.
