<PRE>First thing, any Mac made in even somewhat recent history should still 
boot fine with a dead PRAM battery.  Second, I think that the batteries 
used in all the portables are rechargeable, though some (like the 
iBooks) don't have a battery at all.  Just plugging it in for a day 
straight is enough to recharge the backup battery.
Also, even if your PowerBook doesn't make any noise or show anything on 
the screen, it can still be &quot;on&quot;.  That's why you should check the caps 
lock light.

And why are you worrying about losing your data and preferences?  You 
*DO* back up your computer regularly, don't you???
Let me put it this way for everybody that doesn't:  Hard drives fail, 
computers are stolen, software gets corrupt.  These things tend to 
happen at exactly the least convenient time possible.  If you have a 
day or a week or a month (or however long it would take you to recreate 
all your data) to waste at some random time, well, save the $200 for a 
FireWire hard drive or something similar.  If you don't have that much 
free time, back up NOW.
Personally, I back up to DVDs about once a year, to a CD whenever I 
have enough data to justify it, and to a USB flash drive when I only 
have a small amount to back up.

</I>&gt;<i> This is what I thought. However, the PRAM battery could be drained...?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  You could always try removing the battery and run it off AC alone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but it shouldn't make a difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did that...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   My best guess would be to reset the power manager.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did that..too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  On that model, turn it off (press the caps lock key and make sure it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't light up; if it does, hold down the power button until it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turns off, that's how you know when the computer is totally off).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't have to worry because it was never on..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Find the little reset button on the back of the computer, near the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modem port IIRC.  Press it briefly once, and make sure it doesn't get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> caught on the edge of the case when you release it.  Wait five
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seconds, press the power button.  See if that makes a difference.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just out of curiosity, you might want to check both before and after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether the caps lock light comes on after pressing the power button.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NADA. Dead dead dead.  And yup, as soon as I make room I'll get that
</I>&gt;<i> dual G5 but you can bet it will get used right away. :-) In fact when
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in the store I will be tempted to bring home either one of those
</I>&gt;<i> or, a new laptop but get the 23&quot; display for home working...trouble is,
</I>&gt;<i> if you take the laptop somewhere and it gets swiped, there goes all
</I>&gt;<i> your work...set up, everything.
