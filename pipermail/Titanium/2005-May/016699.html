<PRE>Tell us your real feelings Woz and Shawn.. :) I love mine more than I  
thought I would - and as far as any Moto phone goes. It's a ton  
better than my Moto v.600 that I stomped on.  Yea yea, I know the  
Motorola UI is bad and that compared to my wife's Samsung, I can't  
see the menu as well,  BUT:  it doesn't beep much when it's in my  
pocket (other stuff hitting the volume keys,) and it does charge from  
a usb adapter.! I cant find any other phone that's small, got a flip  
cover and supports BT. I got mine unlocked and not from Cingular, so  
it uses the various sim cards I need to use (incl. t-mobile in the US  
and western Europe, Cosmote in Greece and PTN in Australia and the  
South Pacific). I figure it will last me  a year or two until THE  
phone arrives. it is in summary - mostly harmless.

</I>&gt;<i> to customize ring tones for callers. There's no audible 'answer'  
</I>&gt;<i> command so you have to at least press some button to take a call on  
</I>&gt;<i> a bike. The bluetooth hands-free in a car drops calls every few  
</I>&gt;<i> seconds most of the time. It gets hung up in bluetooth hands-free  
</I>&gt;<i> mode to where you can't use the hand-free car system or the RAZR  
</I>&gt;<i> phone. The only solution sometimes is to stop the car, turn it off,  
</I>&gt;<i> and turn it back on. The RAZR sometimes shuts down while doing  
</I>&gt;<i> nothing. It has other freezes that sometimes require removing the  
</I>&gt;<i> battery to restart. The UI is so bad that you can easily get into  
</I>&gt;<i> situations that are ridiculous while doing the most normal things  
</I>&gt;<i> like getting your voicemail or when a second call comes in. Don't  
</I>&gt;<i> bother to ask what happens if a second call comes in while in hands- 
</I>&gt;<i> free mode in a car. This phone doesn't have Java so it cannot be used
</I>&gt;<i>   with Salling clicker. I really miss that one. It was also  
</I>&gt;<i> incompatible with the Macintosh but at least that got cleared up  
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat in Tiger.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can buy an unlocked RAZR phone at your Cingular store but you  
</I>&gt;<i> have to ask for the calling card plan. But if you use an [older]  
</I>&gt;<i> AT&amp;T wireless SIM card, you don't get AIM or internet access  
</I>&gt;<i> (MMode). I had to switch my accounts to Cingular for these  
</I>&gt;<i> features. I knew that with AT&amp;T Wireless, I could access the  
</I>&gt;<i> internet (via bluetooth setup in the Network System Preference)  
</I>&gt;<i> through my phone by setting it up to dial &quot;proxy&quot; with no name or  
</I>&gt;<i> password. But with Cingular the combination is more difficult and I  
</I>&gt;<i> haven't yet been able to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have several very knowledgable gadget/technology friends who all  
</I>&gt;<i> say the same thing as myself, that this phone is the worst piece of  
</I>&gt;<i> cr*p ever made, but it sure is beautiful so we all use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a side note, this phone is so thin that I very straight-faced  
</I>&gt;<i> tell people that it's solar powered. And Infrared too I say, so it  
</I>&gt;<i> powers off your body heat while in your pocket. I point out that  
</I>&gt;<i> there's no dock port on the bottom to charge it even. You'd be  
</I>&gt;<i> surprised how many tech experts even fall for this one.
