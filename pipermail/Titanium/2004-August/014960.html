<PRE>Kynan Shook paused, thought it over, and spoke thusly:

&gt;<i>Actually, most drives write faster than they read; I'm not sure 
</I>&gt;<i>exactly why this is the case, but here are several &quot;drive 
</I>&gt;<i>comparison&quot; pages from barefeats.com that can back me up;
</I>
I use QuickBench on my own drives, so the results are skewed 
somewhat. Half my drives write marginbally faster.

The 800 firewire drives both read faster than they write:

20 MB file:  Read: 44.802 MB/sec  Write: 33.248 MB/sec

60MB file:   Read 45.388 MB/sec   Write: 33,250  MB/sec

100MB &quot;:   Read : 44.568  MB/sec  Write: 33,266 MB/sec

Now, doing the same test on a smaller partition, on one of the same 
800 drives, that is  fragmented:

20MB   Read: 29.823   Write: 33.271
100MB  Read: 30.275  Write: 30.868

On my internal IBM (standard on the 667):

The write speed is definitely faster, but it's marginal:

20MB  Read: 12.706 MB/sec   Write: 13.677 MB/sec

at the 100MB file size: the Read : 12.798 MB/sec  write:  13.019 MB/sec

So yeah, sure, it's faster, but look at the margin.

That's why i use the internal for the day-to-day 'small stuff', and 
the externals for the things that matter. Because they read even 
faster than they write. As long as i take some care on disk 
maintenance. The smaller partition has plenty of drive 'space' but is 
definitely fragged, at the time of the little test here. Two days 
ago, the numbers were considerably different.

One thing I tend to put more stock in: Results on my own setup are 
more meaningful, to me, than stuff in a lab somewhere.  It comes back 
to which is faster? Writing sequences of ones and zeroes in a bulk 
file to use for advertising specs, or running batches of different 
type/size files and seeing what 'really' transpires.

Maybe most drives do write faster than they read. I find that 
backwards of what I need to do. I need fast reads. And I get them. 
Obviously, your mileage isn't the only one that 'varies'.

My F-wire 800 drives aren't even 'native' on the 667, they're running 
through a PC card. I have a feeling they'd get better 'specs' on a 
native fast firewire bus, maybe., but for now, i can live with 44-45 
MB/sec reads... and the writes suit me fine.
