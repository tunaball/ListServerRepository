<PRE>Kynan Shook paused, thought it over, and spoke thusly:

&gt;<i>Writing to the disk slows down by about 10% or so; so little of your 
</I>&gt;<i>computer's time is spent writing that turning it off won't make much 
</I>&gt;<i>of a difference, except for making reboots after a crash take much, 
</I>&gt;<i>much longer.
</I>
With all due respect, running a 667 Ti here, that i keep maintained 
to the max, with external Firewire 800 drives running on the PC card 
slot (that read/write 10MB/sec faster than the internal IBM drive), 
and a GB of RAM, and some free disk space.... why on Earth would I 
want to save, what, 30 seconds once a week on a reboot, and, in 
return, give up 10% of the speed on a constant basis?

The logic escapes me totally. In 2 years I've had a grand total of 
one kernel panic. Big deal.

Lost data due to anything software/hardware related? ZERO.

Acidentally hard-rebooting when a big app freezes causes a reboot 
that takes about 1 minute 17 seconds. Normal reboot time: 1:17. 
Where's the 'issue'? Reboot when booted into OS 9?  Under 40 seconds.

Analysis: Apple's 'hybrid' OSX (mach/Darwin/pdf/QuickTime window 
manager/Finder has enough problems (speed included0, so why add to 
the load?

Giving up 10% (if it's even that little) on a constant basis, in 
return for a marginally quicker restart after a catastrophic crash 
(how often are they happening i'd like to know), ... is like losing 
10 bucks every five minutes and saying, &quot;It's cool, I put 30 bucks in 
my savings account every two weeks.&quot; Sounds inefficient, pointless, 
and almost totally unnecessary.

My advice: Back up your docs, email addresses, and passwords to a 
gold-ongold CD or DVD, Keep your installers, and dump anything that 
slows down the Mac. People, everywhere it seems, are 'filling-up' on 
utilities that perform tasks that the OS can already do on its own, 
and why? More clutter, more variables to sort through in cases of 
conflicts... wasted space, and more missed opportunities to really 
know and use the OS that's right in front of us (the one 'hidden' by 
the GUI, of course).

A Finder that uses thousands of _DS files to supposedly keep track of 
each folder's contents, etc, and then pauses whenever any folder or 
menu item is clicked for the first time after a login, and can't even 
remember to &quot;Open all new folders in Column View&quot; (why is that 
'option' even included?)... does not need more 'baggage'.
