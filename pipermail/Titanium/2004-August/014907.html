Thursday 5 August 2004

One week later, yesterday, I have received no SuperDrive from Apple, 
so I call them.

They said that someone had cancelled the shipment of the DVD drive to 
me, but could not say who or why.  It is hard to believe that 
'someone', withiout leaving any record in the file, can just cancel 
an important shipment.

Today, I called Apple, who said it was cancelled because the 
SuperDrive is not a user-serviceable part.
I KNOW THAT........ I was not going to do anything except take it to 
the authorised repair shop, who had agreed to do the work and had 
undertaken to ship the dead drive back to Apple within 10 working 
days of receipt.

Apple said there is nothing they can do to help me, as they now say 
that the authorised service centre has to order the part. 
Fortunately, I found a very helpful person at the service centre here 
in Geneva (ART Computer) who ordered the part this evening, just 
based on a phone call, and promised to call me when the drive 
arrived, and that he would fix it the same working day.  That is what 
I call service.

I leave next Friday for Saudi Arabia, so the timing is now very tight.

Then I read the catalogue of problems that Sam has had with his 1Ghz 
Powerbook, and I felt better.

regards,  Trevor
