<PRE>i didn't actually post because i was using a diff adress.. sory all. 
this applies same to you too though!

it probably is the cells. li-ion cells die after so many 
cycles(temperature and charging). try using Xbattery(you can find it on 
versiontracker) to see how dead it is. to get a little extra 
temporarily you can try charging it up fully, and then over the next 
few days keep it plugged in and every hour or so, unplug it for about 
five minutes. after a full overnight charge, let it run down into sleep 
mode. that last bit only resets the battery's capacity value(for time 
left calculations etc)

you can get new cells for about 40-120$ and solder them in yourself. 
the price depends on how much capacity the cells have, from 
1200-2400mah each at 3.7v. the cell size is 18650 and from what i've 
seen, unless you're very careful, it's more of a risk breaking the 
electronics inside while opening it up.

i found that there are several manufacturers now. on ebay there are 
some 4000mah batteries for about 100 bucks total always. you can also 
get a 4800mah battery made by newertech that is $150, which is about 30 
more than the cells themselves, and actually a pretty good deal. if you 
check dealmac.com daily you should be able to find a sale within a few 
weeks on some decent battery. i've been searching for a replacement 
battery for my 800, and yesterday i found on ebay a used, scratched 
4400mah battery for 70 bucks total. you never know what you'll find, i 
figure at that price, even if it's holding 4000mah, it's a deal. so you 
can find them.
i'll take your ~dead one if you wanna get rid of it without disposal 
costs. i have some new cells looking for a battery housing and a 
project that's going to take a few batteries. (in may)

well, whatever you decide to do, good luck!

So my tibook 550 needs a new battery, I say this, because it loses its
charge completely, oh, within about an hour.

I should expect more, no? But i'm sure given the age of the battery, 
that
eventually it loses its charge.

Anybody have any suggestions? price/performance, etc. and where to buy.

Thanks again!

Rgds,

Mano
