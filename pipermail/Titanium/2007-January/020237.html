<PRE>The trend is one that started over ten years ago and is slowly coming 
to fruition.  Computers, media players (television, radio, music. 
photos, film, video), graphics design, publsihing and 
telecommunications are merging - across both technical and economic 
models.

Embracing the whole of this reality by calling Apple Computers, Inc.  
Apple, Inc. should be no surprise to anyone except for the Beatles who 
lost their last lawsuit filed in England against Apple Computers last 
year effectively clearing the way for the name change which they 
probably wanted to do years ago when the iPod was first introduced.

It is smart marketing.  Period.  Say what you want about Jobs, but no 
one can argue with the fact that he is a top of the line marketing 
professional.  After yesterday's announcement Apple stock hit its all 
time high.

Mac sales are up, the Mac OS X is the system for the iPhone, Mac Books 
and desktops are cross platform, and Apple announce Apple TV just as 
Apple gets in bed with AT&amp;T at a time AT&amp;T is coming on strong on the 
delivery end of communications to the end user.  Smart. damn smart.

The best long term protection for the Mac platform is this kind on 
integration.

Jobs was on stage for over 2 hours -- an extra long keynote, I think. 
He barely
mentioned the Mac, spent very had little time on iPod/iTunes so he 
could devote
the appropriate time to the revolutionary iPhone. He did have to give a 
few
minutes to AppleTV.

I have to assume that there are software and hardware updates that will 
be
announced after the iPhone excitement has been allowed to subside a 
little. A
large capacity video iPod with some of the features of the iPhone would 
be nice
-- not everyone has constant need of a cellphone and 4 &amp; 8 gigs is not 
a lot.

&gt;<i>I gaze into my crystal ball and I see Apple getting right out of the
</I>&gt;<i>computer business, selling off the whole division and becoming a
</I>&gt;<i>media company period. After all, it hasn't really been the most
</I>&gt;<i>profitable part of the business for quite awhile. Perhaps Dell or HP
</I>&gt;<i>might be interested...or IBM?
</I>
To load the music into the iPhone, I assume you will still need a 
computer.
