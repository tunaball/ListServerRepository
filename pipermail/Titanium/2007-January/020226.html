Frank - probably most of us on the list are amateurs (i know some are  
not), but with experience, and we heave learnt lessons the hard way.

I think the lesson from your story is &quot;if you buy or get a Powerbook  
from somewhere else, reformat the disk and reinstall the latest OS,  
before you do anything else&quot;.

That would not cost you more than $100, or zero if you had the OS  
disks already.


regards,  Trevor
