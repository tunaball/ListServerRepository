<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tom - I also think that it is pretty likely that computer (hardware 
</I>&gt;<i> and software) announcements will come later, to maintain the wave 
</I>&gt;<i> created by the iPhone introduction.
</I>&gt;<i> 10.4.9 is in the pipeline, so we hear.  We know 10.5 is coming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I was surprised that no mention was made, as far as I recall, of any 
</I>&gt;<i> VoIP capability for the iPhone.  Will Skype work ?  Skype to Skype?
</I>&gt;<i>   How about iChat ?  Instant messaging over the internet rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> SMS over the paid network?  The demo of SMS seemed to have the same 
</I>&gt;<i> syntax/GUI as the messaging in iChat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - since CISCO launched THEIR iPhone some weeks ago - and seem to have 
</I>&gt;<i> rights to the name - I was indeed surprised to find that Apple have a 
</I>&gt;<i> product with the name iPhone.
</I>&gt;<i> Do they have a name-sharing agreement, or what ?  Maybe some of the 
</I>&gt;<i> legal guys on the list have a view?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I must say I was very impressed (otherwise) with the iPhone.  i think 
</I>&gt;<i> their statement of reinventing the phone is very apt.  Even the very 
</I>&gt;<i> best current phone fades in to insignificance.
</I>&gt;<i> I just wish it was going to be available in Europe a bit sooner than 
</I>&gt;<i> the end of the year.  I shall just have to keep my 6130i limping along 
</I>&gt;<i> until then...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> regards,  Trevor
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>========================
I was very disappointed with the keynote.  He blew off any discussion 
of new hardware or the new OS, and the hipe was about a device that 
will not be shipping until June.

I also wonder how practical is that large big screen on the iPhone.  
Seems it could easily break or scratch with that level of activity.

I also think he priced it too high.  I think it should have come in at 
about a $100 less that the combined iPod and regular cell phone.  That 
would have made it more enticing.
