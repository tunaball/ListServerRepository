<PRE>One thing not discussed is the tie in of tech between Cingular and Apple
At the Keynote the voicemail integration was at the network level
If the iPhone is unlocked and used on a different network then unless  
Apple/Cingular allow other networks to
use the same level of intergration then you will be stuck with an  
iPhone that has features missing
This Has to have been thought out as if the phone is going to Europe  
and Asia the tech MUST be portable cross network,
but I will bet that Apple will similarly partner with networks in  
those regions and the same issues will arise in every territory.

I have read discussion about this, and most people seem to think it  
will support 3G when it rolls out to Europe. Plus there is talk of a  
CDMA version.... who knows. One of the larger factors is that 3G  
supposedly eats batteries. WiFi does too... so I don't know if that  
argument holds water. Further, the battery is non-removable, so it  
may be very inconvenient in any event which technology you use.

I mean, to sync music wirelessly (one feature people want), probably  
eats up a lot of battery. I'm sure Apple is considering the fact that  
the user will have their device attached to an iPod connector which  
supplies a data connection and power while syncing. I mean, that was  
the benefit of the original iPod - over firewire it charged AND  
synced at the same time. Only a handful of devices at the time  
supported charging over USB. And now people want to remove that  
feature, which I think distinguished it and added to it's simplicity.

I have doubts the iPhone will support VOIP out-of the box, but I have  
all the faith in the world that this will become the fastest hacked  
device on the market when it is released.
