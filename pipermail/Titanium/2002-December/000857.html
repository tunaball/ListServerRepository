<PRE>I totally agree with Michael.  I've picked up a few terminal tricks, but 
I try to stay away from using command lines.  I love the stability and 
fluid feel of unix, but it's much more fun experiencing it through the 
MacOS interface.  My experience was less painful and more rewarding than 
I expected.  The company I work for has been pro-active in obtaining OS 
X-native software for me.  Wow!  I can go days without having to use the 
Classic environment.  I have seen the future and it is pure OS X.  I 
even like MS Office now that I have the X version.  But I have switched 
to InDesign from Quark.  With few exceptions, my older Quark docs open 
fine in InDesign and I have not looked back.  As expected, the 
integration with Illustrator and Photoshop are superior.  So is Adobe's 
attitude toward its users.  The local service bureau has been very 
supportive of the switch, too.  (That was a big factor in the decision 
to go with InDesign.)
