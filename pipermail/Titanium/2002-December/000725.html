Well, I'm not sure how many tens or hundreds of thousands of people you 
know, but I'd be willing to bet that the percentage of people who buy a 
PC from any vendor as a complete unit - meaning they're paying the 
outrageous premium for Windows, etc - who then format that drive, thus 
throwing away $100 or more and then install Linux on it is in the low 
single digit range, if it even makes it that far.

Now have I taken an older Dell or Gateway at work and put Linux on it?  
Sure.  Have I cobbled together parts to make a Linux machine at home?  
Sure.  Do I know people who have assembled machines from brand new 
parts with the sole purpose of running Linux?  Yeah, a few.  But do I 
think there are the kind of hoards out there who a) have the knowledge 
and skill to setup their own Linux box and b) want to throw away money 
on pointless M$ licenses and do what you describe?  No way.

</I>
Sony's late to the game, then.  Other companies have done that for 
years, although most of the big ones have pulled back from the Linux 
pre-installed part of it.  Sony may be the first major company to make 
it *easy* for a normal consumer to buy an OS-less machine.  And they 
just might sell a few of them - but I doubt they'll sell boatloads of 
them.
