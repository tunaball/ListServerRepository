<PRE>Trust me; those ARE grease marks.  You leave skin oils on everything 
you touch.  When I first got my PBG4/500, I was extremely careful with 
it, and I even washed my hands almost every time before I touched it... 
  For the first month or two, I wouldn't get any marks on the screen 
because I kept both my hands and the keyboard so clean.  Eventually 
though, I stopped being quite so careful, and the keyboard got a little 
skin oil on it, which can then get transferred to the screen.  No 
matter how bad the marks are, you can pretty much always remove them, 
if you spend enough time trying.  The lines you're seeing are just 
because those edges of the keys are the highest point, which is all 
that's touching the screen.

FWIW, I use a cloth that I squeeze between the screen and the rest of 
the computer; works great.  Another thing; I've found that for the most 
part, the screen marks only occur when you're moving the computer 
around: you stick it in a bag, where it's subjected to pressure from 
both sides (from other items in the bag, from your body against the 
bag, whatever), which makes the screen flex and hit the keyboard.  I 
carry my laptop around closed all the time without putting pressure on 
the screen, and I don't need the cloth.  But this pretty much means 
either being really careful about holding the laptop vertically, or 
holding it horizontally.
