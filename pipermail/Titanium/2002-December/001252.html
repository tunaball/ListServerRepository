This sounds like the old stories people in Glasgow tell about Edinburgh
hospitality - &quot; Ye'll have had your tea, then&quot;  is now &quot;ye'll have had your
battery charged&quot; - a statement, not a question.

I would like to think that in Glasgow we would offer you a cup of tea AND to
charge your battery.

TRUE STORY: When I left my TiBook charger in work over the weekend recently
and didn't discover this until a got a low battery warning, I phoned up the
local  Glasgow Apple dealer (ScotSys) on Saturday afternoon and they
promptly offered to charge my battery while I went shopping.  (No charge for
the charge). Now that's what I call service!
