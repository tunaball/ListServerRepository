&gt;<i> Well, no, what someone said was along the lines of &quot;correct me if I'm
</I>&gt;<i> wrong...&quot; - and the person is mostly wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just try buying a new 3 GHz P4 from Dell and then try to put DOS on it.
</I>&gt;<i> You'll run into any number of problems, most of which will be insurmountable
</I>&gt;<i> for the average users.  Simple things like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
First of all, I was not talking about the average user. As you might
have noticed the person complaining seems to be a music professional who
just wants a computer that can do all kind of new things (with OS X) but
at the same time still be able to do the things he used to do with his
old computer. The same goes for my statement about DOS. 

Also I never stated I wanted to watch DVD's under DOS. I just wanted to
run old DOS stuff that always ran under DOS run under DOS but slightly
faster, and I am fine with only accessing the disk space I used to. Its
not about making DOS or System 9 better. Its about backward
compatibility. Many people invested large amounts of money in the
software and external hardware they purchased and now because they
bought a new laptop they won't be able to use it anymore? It makes the
argument that OSX is so much better and lets you do so much more stuff
sound very weak, if, in order to do so, I have to rebuy everything I
owned before.

This whole discussion could be extended to hardware and interfaces. Many
PC laptops still have middle age serial and parallel ports and you might
be able to hook some $5 keyboard or mouse to it (not to talk about all
that neat little robot and handmade peripherial stuff you can find on
the net). With the Ti the average user is forced to use USB and firewire
($15 for a mouse $40 for a keyboard). And I still do not quite
understand where the advantages are of a USB Mouse or Keyboard to a the
old ADB style ones (except for the Hot Swapping).
