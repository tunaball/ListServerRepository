<PRE>Interesting points Michael,

The user base has officially spoken I think, with this move. I have been
hearing so much talk over the past few months of people switching to
InDesign because of OSX compatibility. My reality is heavily rooted in Quark
and don't find InDesign to be the proverbial &quot;All that and a bag of chips&quot;
that many report. I have even been considering another machine (a tower
aside from my Ti) for running OS9 exclusively. Like InDesign - most of the
newly carbonized Apps have a *little* way to go yet.

Has Apple come out with anything official yet? Are they going to hush this
one through? I can see them spinning it quite heavily.
