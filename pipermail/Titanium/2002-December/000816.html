If you design a cross platfom app in the first place with endianness 
in mind then yes, it's a no brainer. But for exisiting Mac-only apps 
it will be a non-trivial amount of work to deal with endian issues in 
file I/O and elsewhere.

I do know that certain parts of Mac OS are already optimised for 
AltiVec - I've stepped into the code when debugging. I can't say any 
more without breaking NDA's.

</I>&gt;<i>I said this already. However Cocoa is the future and most high

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Like I said, this is at MINIMUM a year or so away, but it will happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Given that developers have had the Carbon API's for what, 3 years, 
and some of them have /still/ not managed to even Carbonise their 
apps, let alone re-write them for Cocoa, I think it will be a very 
long time before developers would catch up with such a major change. 
Many would probably just not bother - if they've got to do a complete 
re-write then they might as well just re-write for Windows. This was 
why Carbon was so crucial in preventing a mass exodus from Mac to 
Windows when OS X was introduced. Unless Carbon can be ported to x86 
then the same logic applies.

Maybe in 3 - 5 years, but not in the next year or two.
