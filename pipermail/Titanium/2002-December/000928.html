Sorry, you misinterpreted the statement.  What they told you (and this 
is actually a law, IIRC) is that if they know about the specific 
problem you had, they must fix it.  If the problem then occurs again 
after the warranty has expired, they are no longer obligated to fix it.
This is so that a company can't do something like the following: take 
in equipment for service, hold it until the warranty expires, &quot;claim&quot; 
it's fixed, send it back, then the customer immediately reports the 
same problem which was never in fact fixed; the company could then say 
the warranty expired, and get out of fixing the problem.  Instead, the 
company is obligated to repair any problems covered by warranty as long 
as they are reported before the warranty expires: my brother reported 
his keyboard and display were not working properly on his Pismo G3 a 
week before his warranty expired, then sent it in several months later 
when his work didn't depend quite so heavily on his PowerBook.

What this does NOT cover is if a problem is *actually* fixed and then 
the same problem happens again later in the product's life, after the 
warranty has expired.

However, one thing to remember; any repairs made under warranty are 
covered by a 90-day warranty themselves, so any repair you have in the 
last 90 days of warranty service are in effect lengthening the warranty 
on the affected parts.
