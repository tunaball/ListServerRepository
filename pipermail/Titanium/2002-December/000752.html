Amazing! If Apple's hardware were capable of NATIVELY running its own OS
(aka - Mac OS) AND Windows equally well - then your point would certainly
hold. However, since we all know that that is NOT the case - you have to
allow for the fact that HP, Sony, Dell etc are all members of the Wintel
group, while Apple is there by itself. Of course Apple and the rest are
all memebers of the personal computer group, BUT...when you buy a Dell,
and then want to change it to an HP - there's no need to invest in the
software - your Dell computer's software will run on the HP too...NOT so
if you change to an Apple computer.

Now, lets get to the REAL concern of just WHY market share is so
important to us Macsters...Shall we?

Well...if you're a program developer, and there's a 90% slice of the
computer market held by the Windows OS and a 5% &quot;slice&quot; held by Apple
(give Linux at least 5% of the market...)...and assuming that this is NOT
a multimedia or some &quot;specialty niche/thing like Photoshop..just plain old
stuff for Joe Blow....Or maybe an exciting new application...where would
YOU go? My $$ says - with the 90% crowd...which leaves us with a GREAT OS,
GREAT hardware...and no applications...All dressed up and nowhere to go!

Think I'm wrong? Look at the figures!

THAT'S my concern...

Thanks for listening.

Best,

Henry
