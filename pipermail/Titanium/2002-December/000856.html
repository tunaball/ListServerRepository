You're right; it was inappropriate of me to cite a portion of my
qualifications and background as justification for my arguments; it's
a kneejerk response to other people trying to assert their position
from authority, as the other person had.  It's a childish approach,
and should rightfully be ignored.  When one has facts to support one's
argument, one doesn't need such juvenile rhetoric.  My argument
should and does stand on its own merits:  That Solaris 9 on x86 is
not yet out, that Early Access is a normal part of Sun's release 
process, and that Solaris on x86 is fully-functional and perfectly
fine in a production environment.

What's relevant are the facts, and to a lesser extent the ability to
express said facts in a coherent manner supporting a position.

Someone please wake me when anyone else introduces some to
this conversation.  Until then, I consider this thread dead.

Any ad-hominem attacks will be ignored, unless their volume
rises to the point that it becomes noisome.  Then I'll either
ask the list manager to deal with those persons off-list, or I'll
simply leave.  Then you'll have to figure out Cisco rollover cables
and USB-&gt;serial adapters on your own.

Honestly, it's amazing how some people take factual contradiction
as a personal affront.
