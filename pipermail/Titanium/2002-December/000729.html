&gt;<i> Of course it is relevant.  Nobody buys a computer as simply a piece of

Hi Mike

Your point is taken and I agree that of course the OS is important to 
the purchasing user, this however is not the subject of my initial 
comment.

I am looking at market share of manufactures, not the factors that 
drive the consumers buying decision, whatever they may be.

Sure you can compare a company to the entire market in which it trades 
and that is a correct way of looking at a company's performance with 
respect to the market as a whole. If however you wish to see the 
company against its competitors it shows no useful information. Apple 
does not directly compete with over 32% of the Wintel market in the 
shape of 'white box' manufactures. Apple has never stacked high and 
sold cheap. In order to show how competitive Apple is in the Market 
place you also have to show how competitive its competitors are. 
Without seeing how well other companies in the market place themselves, 
then deciding how they are in competition, there is no basis for 
comparison.

This is not a Wintel vs Mac Shoot out or an attempt to bolster the 
worth of Apple or Mac's. I am just showing that Apple is one of the top 
10 biggest computer manufactures with many companies who produce far 
less computers per year. It would not matter what kind of computer they 
sold Wintel, Mac or Wonder Widget PC.

Now do you get where I am coming from?

Alex
