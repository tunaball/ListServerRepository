Well, even if it were an attempt to bolster the worth of Apple or Mac's 
I wouldn't mind - I've made my switch and I'm happy with it.  :)

I just don't think that comparing Apple to individual companies versus 
comparing Apple to the whole is the same as comparing Dell to 
individual companies versus comparing Dell to the whole.  And I think 
that because in many ways it *is* an &quot;us vs them&quot; kind of thing (not 
going rabid here - I've still got a PC at home for Quicken and games, 
and yeah, I know there is Quicken for the Mac - I just hear it sucks 
and I don't want my personal stuff on a laptop from work) because all 
the rest of the market (the vast majority of it anyway) is selling the 
same kind of thing whereas Apple is not.

I do get where you're coming from - I'm just not sure I agree that 
&quot;Apple had (or has) more market share than Toshiba&quot; is a particularly 
valuable thing to know.

But yes, Apple is certainly one of the top companies - no denying that. 
  That they have offered something that for so long has been so 
completely incompatible (to the average joe anyway - I'm thinking pre 
10 and possibly even pre 9 days) and maintained a slot among the top 
companies shows their products are good.
