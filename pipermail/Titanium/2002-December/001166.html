<PRE>Made my Day. Hope you don't mind - I forwarded it to the people at News  
of the Weird. So as not to steal,  I included the header information  
with your email address... :)

&gt;<i> We've all heard of the Darwin Awards, which recognises people that  
</I>&gt;<i> have done really stupid things and died in the process.  I don't know  
</I>&gt;<i> of an equivalent for dumb thieves, but the bloke who has the starring  
</I>&gt;<i> role in the following story deserves a life membership if such an  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;organisation&quot; exists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a spare few minutes today, so was looking through the Quokka, a  
</I>&gt;<i> classified newspaper here in Perth.  In the Wanted section was a  
</I>&gt;<i> person looking for some iMac software, so being a Mac dealer I gave  
</I>&gt;<i> him a call.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He brings the iMac over about 6pm so that it could be left here  
</I>&gt;<i> overnight for me to re-install all the system software from some  
</I>&gt;<i> original iMac CDs that I have here.  Being the curious nosy bugger  
</I>&gt;<i> that I am, I was asking him how long he's had it, etc, etc, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It was a gift.&quot;  Thus, alarm bell number one starts doing a really  
</I>&gt;<i> funky sort of a dance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He then sees a USB keyboard on one of my desks here and comments that  
</I>&gt;<i> he paid $100 for one last week because he didn't get a keyboard with  
</I>&gt;<i> the iMac.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Got the iMac as a gift, but without a keyboard, eh?  Thus, alarm bell  
</I>&gt;<i> number two starts ringing.  Other alarm bells start revving their  
</I>&gt;<i> engines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whilst conversing with Mr Moron, I quietly load up (on my PowerBook  
</I>&gt;<i> laptop) Apple's web site for checking serial numbers.  Voila, the  
</I>&gt;<i> bright red letters &quot;STOLEN&quot; turn up.  I close the screen immediately  
</I>&gt;<i> so that Mr Moron doesn't see this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bugger alarm bell number three, the whole bloody alarm bell population  
</I>&gt;<i> is going nuts, whilst I try to prevent from breaking out laughing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The subject of digital cameras then came up, so I showed off my  
</I>&gt;<i> beloved Canon G2 digital camera.  Took some demo pics and showed him  
</I>&gt;<i> the quality.  Of course, one of these photos was of Mr Moron in my  
</I>&gt;<i> front yard, thus having evidence that he was here.  Mr Moron's IQ  
</I>&gt;<i> level starts plummeting dangerously towards the single digit mark.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the applications have been deleted from the iMac, so I put Outlook  
</I>&gt;<i> Express on there and open it.  Lo and behold, email appears.  Sifting  
</I>&gt;<i> through email found the actual owner's name, home address and phone  
</I>&gt;<i> number.  I recovered another stolen iMac in June last year the same  
</I>&gt;<i> way (that particular idiot was convicted in court in March this year).  
</I>&gt;<i>  One must appreciate how thieves manage to trash all the applications,  
</I>&gt;<i> but never think about the Preferences and other stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A quick phone call to Mr Victim has us both VERY amused (giggling like  
</I>&gt;<i> idiots, actually).  His house was burgled and ransacked a month ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He is a university student, and uninsured.  Bummer, why couldn't it be  
</I>&gt;<i> some ultra rich person with valuable data, who would then give me a  
</I>&gt;<i> new Ferrari and KTM as a reward?????
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mr Victim will be picking up his iMac soon, and we will discuss how  
</I>&gt;<i> we'll present this lovely tale to the constabulary.  With Christmas a  
</I>&gt;<i> few days away, I suspect that Mr Moron isn't going to be having the  
</I>&gt;<i> best weekend of his life.  If police follow their usual pattern of  
</I>&gt;<i> house searches, they'll get Mr Moron out of bed nice and bright and  
</I>&gt;<i> early (ie so he's too tired to destroy or hide anything).  The bloke I  
</I>&gt;<i> got busted last year had 14 police search his house because they had  
</I>&gt;<i> another major search to do nearby the same morning, so they did his  
</I>&gt;<i> house as a warm up!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moral(s) of the story:
</I>&gt;<i> If your Mac gets knocked off, make sure it's on Apple's database
</I>&gt;<i> Bring stolen Macs to me, I could do with the laugh
</I>&gt;<i> Make sure your computer equipment is properly insured
</I>&gt;<i> Record your serial numbers!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still Laughing,
</I>&gt;<i> Phil
</I>&gt;<i> Thinking he needs to get some &quot;Go ahead, make my day&quot; t-shirts made up.
</I>&gt;<i>
