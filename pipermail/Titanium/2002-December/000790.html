<PRE>choosing DOS as an example was just to point how little Apple about
backward compatibility cares. As you just pointed out there is no
problem installing Windoze 98 (probably System 8 equivalent) or the same
ol NT 4 on a current Wintel machine. And this I know for sure cause I
have done so! But all I want is to run System 9 on a new machine and I
soon won't even be allowed to do that anymore? 

Thanks for your lengthy explanations about DOS and where its used! 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In an attempt to draw an analogy between OS 9 and DOS you've made
</I>&gt;<i> claims that are at a minimum overstated and most likely just plain
</I>&gt;<i> wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I still do not understand which of my statements was wrong. As you said yourself:

&quot;You 
*might* be able to get it to work, albeit with almost no functionality 
compared to what you'd get out of WIndows XP, but Dell would laugh at 
you if you called up wanting help with it.  Apple's just making a move 
that is necessary (in its opinion) to move forward.&quot;

In your own words you aren't sure yourself if it is possible or not, so
how come you are getting angry and telling me that I am wrong, where all
I tried was to find out from somebody who knows (which does not seem to
be you!), whether or not I am right. Which was exactly the reason why I
used the formulation &quot;correct me if I am wrong&quot;.

</PRE>
