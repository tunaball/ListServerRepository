During this exchange, I have refrained from name calling, and personally 
attacking you just because you hold a different viewpoint.  If your 
social skills are really that non-existent, then it would be better for 
you to do as you first suggested and go elsewhere.  Or maybe *I* should 
complain to the list admin about being personally attacked for no 
reason.  Your personal attacks are not going to help you to assert your 
position.

With your great success in easily installing unix, or unix clone 
operating systems in various x86 boxen, you're obviously an expert in 
the field.  After this, I will be sure to send anybody your way for help 
with the unix drivers for all the winmodems I and many other people 
never been able to get to work with anything but windows.  Just one 
small example of how hardware is optimized for a particular operating 
system.  You can attack me all you want, if that makes you feel good and 
superior to the rest of us, but you'll fail to convince me that 
hardware/software optimization is not an issue, especially with 
processors.  I know better.
