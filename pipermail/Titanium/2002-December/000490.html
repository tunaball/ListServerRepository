<PRE>My year plus experience with a Ti 500 showed key marks on the screen, 
this despite use of leather and other inserts. I continued to use 
iKlear on the screen and the keyboard and have eliminated any insert. 
My wife and I really don't see any key &quot;imprints&quot; any more. Perhaps it 
also had to do with locking the keyboard down which on the Ti 500 is 
between F4 and F5. On my new Ti 1 gig the lock is between F5 and F6. I 
have not used any inserts on the Ti 1 gig but do clean the screen and 
keyboard occasionally and have not noticed any marks appearing although 
I've only had the Ti 1 gig for a few weeks.

Incidentally the Ti 1 gig feels more &quot;solid&quot; than the Ti 500 and seems 
to have been strengthened in  the cd/dvd area. It used to be if you 
grabbed that area while a DVD was playing the play would be affected - 
that doesn't seem to be a problem with the Ti 1 gig.

It's also interesting to note that there have been some keyboard 
changes e.g. the two keys to the right of the space bar on the 500 
Enter &amp; Option have been changed to Cmd (Apple) &amp; Enter; the F7 key on 
the 1 gig has an added symbol indicating that the key is to be used to 
&quot;toggle between dual display mode and video mirroring mode;&quot; and 
finally the mute key has been changed from F6 to F3.

As far as Ti 1 gig Airport reception, I believe it has improved 
although I haven't really challenged it.

All in all IMHO there have been some subtle but nice improvements, 
evidence I guess of a mature product and Apple listening to feedback.

</PRE>
