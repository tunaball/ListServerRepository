Who said anything about the market side of things?

But no, I don't think the fact that a whole bunch of artists and other 
entertainment types use Macs has much, if any, impact on the &quot;market 
side of things.&quot;  They may all use a particular brand of toilet paper 
as well, but unless they're promoting it in commercials and other 
advertisements their toilet paper may well be a niche product as well.

I don't account for Apple's miniscule market share.  I'm a classicist 
by education, a system administrator by profession, and a recent 
switcher by choice.  I've never owned my own Macintosh although I would 
say before that was a choice dictated as much by cost as it was by my 
own perception at the time (and still mostly today) of the MacOS over 
the years being &quot;not so great&quot; to be nice.  OS X and the TiBook I have 
from work brought me happily into the Mac fold and I'll continue to use 
them as long as possible even if Apple continues to have a miniscule 
market share - even if it means I have to buy my own Macs for home.

For all I know Bill Gates made a deal with the devil years ago, but I'd 
guess it is more likely related to the historically high price of Mac 
machines and the comparative lack of selection when it comes to 
software.  No flames, please, I'm on your side now - I'm just thinking 
out loud based on my own experiences and those of people I know.
