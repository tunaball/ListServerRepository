Well firstly, the Ti is obviously NOT the most sought after notebook 
computer in the known universe or else it would be selling a lot more 
than it is. I too am typing this on a Ti 550, and I love it. However, 
it still stands to reason that the processor inside the Ti has ZERO 
bearing on why it's a great laptop. It's a great laptop because it's 
engineered beautifully and because it runs MacOS, that's it. The allure 
of the TiBook has absolutely NOTHING whatsoever to do with what 
processor it has inside excepting of course the fact that the processor 
inside it allows it to run MacOS.

And even if the Ti did have a mobile P4 in it, it still wouldn't be  
just &quot;another x86 notebook computer&quot; because it would have been 
designed and engineered by Apple. It wouldn't be able to run Windows 
without a PC compatible BIOS, which it most certainly would not have.

Is that why you like MacOS? Because it puts you in a 5% minority? 
Funny, I like it because I think it's the best OS on the market, and 
I'd use it if 100% of the world used it. I don't pick computing 
platforms to be cool or appear &quot;hipper than thou&quot;, I choose them to get 
my work done and move on with my life.
