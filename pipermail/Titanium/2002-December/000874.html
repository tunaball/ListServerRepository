That could be, but I sure see alot of these things at conferences with 
people running linux in them, and hear many linux users saying they wish 
they had one.  I didn't say &quot;best selling&quot; either.  And I maybe 
should've used the term &quot;the most coveted notebook&quot; instead of &quot;most 
sought after&quot;.  And all for good reason.  I've owned my share of x86 
notebooks running linux.  The G4 Powerbook is simply the best I've found 
for running any of the PPC Linux distributions.  And it's support for 
the hardware in the PPC Linux distros that make the G4 (or iBook) the 
best.  Install linux in one of these things and everything Just 
Works(tm), including the modem.  We have some problems, right now, with 
the graphics card in the newest PowerBooks, but that will be solved shortly.

LOL.  I use it because it has the unix tools I use everyday, with a much 
better GUI that provides a better suite of software than KDE3 on Linux, 
or Gnome on Solaris.  But at the same time, yes, I'm proud of the fact 
that I do not use any Microsoft operating systems, which technically 
makes me part of the minority.
