<PRE>Sorry Chris, I phrased that poorly.  What I *should* have said is that 
there was some miscommunication somewhere: whether the rep stated it 
poorly, or whether he had a poor grasp of what he was communicating I 
can't say.  But the truth is that once a problem is fixed, it's only 
covered under the 90-day service warranty, the 1-year hardware 
warranty, or the 3-year AppleCare warranty, whichever is longer.  If a 
problem is fixed and it happens again a year or two out of warranty, 
it's completely up to Apple if they will fix it or not; and in most 
cases (unless it's just barely out of warranty) they probably won't fix 
it.  I just don't want anybody to get their hopes up that since they 
had a DVD drive replaced once under warranty, they get to have free DVD 
drives for life if theirs ever breaks again.
