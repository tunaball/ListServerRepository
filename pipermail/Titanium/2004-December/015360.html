An update to an application doesn't always mean you're going to get a 
new version number.  Sometimes just the static or dynamically linked 
libraries (frameworks) are updated.

The Quicktime framework on Mac does all of the heavy lifting when it 
comes to displaying images and playing sounds and movies, while the 
Quicktime Player application, for instance, is just a graphical 
interface to accessing the Quicktime framework. Finder previews use 
Quicktime to render images and movies directly in the Finder window. 
Preview and iPhoto uses Quicktime to display pictures. The alert sounds 
that you hear coming from your Mac are all processed by Quicktime. 
iTunes uses Quicktime to play all the music files.  PDF is even 
integrated into Quicktime and the Mac's imaging model is based on the 
PDF specification contained in Quicktime.

Deleting the application &quot;Quicktime Player&quot; is far different from 
removing Quicktime entirely from Mac OS X. Quicktime Player is simply 
the main application that uses the framework to display the relevant 
files. You can delete it if you want, and Mac OS X will not complain. 
But if you delete the actual Quicktime framework (located at 
/System/Library/Frameworks/Quicktime.framework ), Finder, Mail, 
Quicktime Player, Preview, iChat, iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, and so 
forth, will all cease to function. Applications that aren't based on 
Quicktime, like iSync, Terminal, TextEdit, or Safari, will continue to 
work normally.

In this case, and the reason a reboot was required after the update, is 
because the Quicktime framework was replaced, and portions of it affect 
different applications.  Therefore the application that uses the 
framework was updated, but it doesn't mean you're going to get a new 
build.
