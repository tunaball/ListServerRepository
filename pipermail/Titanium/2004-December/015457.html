<PRE>I cracked the shell of a 12&quot; clamshell iBook a couple years ago...  
It's a fun project, though it's not for the faint of heart.  And the 
one I took apart was already broken, so I didn't have to worry about 
killing anything.  ;-)  There are lots of things that can get broken - 
like the miniscule fluorescent lamp that provides all the light for the 
screen.  The 15&quot; Titanium is probably the hardest laptop in existence 
to take the LCD out - or at least, on the Mac side of things.  The 
Aluminum 15&quot; is cake (comparatively, at least - still not for the faint 
of heart).

The only thing you'll want to know is, as that article already sent on 
Tom's Hardware somewhat mentions, you need brightness from your 
overhead.  What they don't tell you is that an LCD showing all white 
will have a little less than half the brightness of the projector with 
nothing on it.  This is an inherent quality of LCDs because they must 
be backlit; OLEDs, which produce their own light at the pixel level 
rather than being backlit across the whole screen, don't have this 
characteristic, and hence can use much less power.

Anyway, good luck with it - maybe while you're at it, improve upon the 
article's suggestion by getting a *quiet* cooling fan (perhaps even 
replacing the projector's internal fan, which is likely to be quite 
loud).


&gt;<i> Is there anyone here that has removed the back casing from their LCD
</I>&gt;<i> display and put it with the Powerbook on an overhead project to display
</I>&gt;<i> large screen display?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if this is feasible and how it works?
</I>
</PRE>
