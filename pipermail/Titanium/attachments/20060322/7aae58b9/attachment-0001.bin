	I am having a hard time downloading and installing Adobe Reader. UPS
labels won't print with Preview.

	Anyway, I downloaded it several times. It went through the automatic
install routine and everything looked cool until I tried to run the
program. The message said 'Adobe Reader 7.0 can't install and will
quit.' 

	I contacted UPS and they sent me along to Adobe. After several
e-mails and phone calls Adobe told me to uninstall everything Adobe
Reader I could find, and start over, so I did. 

	This time the download stops after downloading a file called
<<i>'DownloadReader7.pkg'<<-i> which my PB can't recognize. I have the
feeling I threw too many things away when I was wildly uninstalling. I
would hope I can install just the missing piece. What is it? Where can
I find it? How can I install it.

	I haven't tried any other downloads since so I don't know if my whole
download/install thingy is screwed up.
