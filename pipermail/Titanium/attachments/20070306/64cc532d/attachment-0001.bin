<excerpt>Is there any way to find out the value of a powerbook g4 1ghz
in June 2006?


June is when a computer tech took my powerbook for repairs and now
after a long saga I am in small claims court with him.  He says my
computer is worth $200 because it has devalued, it was bought in 2003. 
I think he owes me it's worth in June 2006 not March 2007, since he
has had it since then without returning it.


Thanks,

WHAT ?????


$200 ?????


What a thief !


check on ebay in the "completed listings" section for the same type of
powerbooks, and you'll have the average value today, and back to 3
months I think.


Good luck.
