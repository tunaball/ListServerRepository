did you try pressing the little button on the very right side of the
slot (where you putthe cd in)?

it is really hard to see ....but with a ballpoint pen you can do it... 

the powerbookhas to have power to eject it, so just start it up - it
doesn't have to run system-wise, just have power... and press that
little button ....

hope it helps,cya
