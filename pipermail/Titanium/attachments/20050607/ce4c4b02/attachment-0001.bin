So we will still have better computers than the Windows crowd, and
Apple will still make great hardware? Can we assume that correct,
Great and Powerful Woz?

I am optimistic, although I didn't expect to be.


I, as other PowerBook users, must appreciate lower power consumption
per unit of computation and I don't distrust Apple's engineers to be
cognizant of that in the future, for both IBM and Intel processors.


A lot of wording today was in terms of Intel and not X-86. Apple is
surely expecting something special and unknown (today) by the time
this ships. That's my opinion. The future probably holds processor
advantages for Intel.


Regardless, a lot of us don't care that much about the engine used
under the hood.


I'm confident that the compatibility path will be well accomplished. I
notice the specialness of my computer in terms of input/output, not
the processor inside. Our Macintoshes should remain 'special' but also
high performance and even more bang for the buck, which doesn't take
away from what makes them so special.


If the processor is important to some extent, then it's better to have
a willing partner.
