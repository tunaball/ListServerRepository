I have the same problem, vertical stripes on screen that appear after
few minutes of use and get worse with time. The archive has a lot of
info but it is very hard to search without Spotlight if you don't have
Tiger.

<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><smaller> Yeah, your LCD cable is
going bad, could be due to a bad hinge.  Suggest you go to the list
archive as this has been discussed to death and you might find a
specific reference to your exact problem.  Next time you have a Ti
problem suggest you start with the archive as it will be quicker if
not more
informative.</smaller></fontfamily>_______________________________________________
