 Comedian commentary on the campaign:

 "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno":


 "The big story this week continues to be these forged documents that
turned up on '60 Minutes'. Or, as the Democrats call them, weapons of
mass distraction!"


 "Fox News announced they have phony documents also, but then they
realized 'Oh, it's just our regular script."'


 "I don't know what the big deal is about these phony documents. I
mean, the last election we had phony documents too. Remember in
Florida? They were called ballots."


 "Senator Kennedy has accused President Bush of incompetence. Bush
fired back; he said, 'Let me tell you something, pal, my bladder is
working just fine!"'


 "In Vegas, Kerry accused Bush of living in a fantasy world. And
everyone in Vegas immediately said, 'So? Duh!"'


 "Are you getting sick of this? This election is just draining --
Vietnam stories, Purple Hearts, National Guard records. Is that how
we're going to decide our next president? I say let's go back to the
old fashioned American way. Find the handsomest guy who's the best
liar and give the job to him."</x-tad-smaller>
