<bigger><bigger><x-tad-bigger> I’ve got a CD ROM stuck in my Powerbook
Aluminum. I have tried all the tricks (Restarting while pressing the
mouse pad, restarting with Option-Apple-F-O, ejecting via the
terminal, and even going into Target mode). None of them work. I am
about to give up and bring it in to an Apple authorized shop. Does
anyone have any other unique solutions? Thanks.</x-tad-bigger></bigger></bigger></excerpt><excerpt>
