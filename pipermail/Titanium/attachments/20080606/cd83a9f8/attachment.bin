<fontfamily><param>Arial</param>I’m new to using a G4 powerbook
mercury (OS 10.3).  I was trying to change the password and disc in
the drive that I was using will not eject.</fontfamily>

<fontfamily><param>Arial</param>All it does is chatter.  I’ve tried
several eject methods from the Mac help section and none seem to do
anything…but each one I try the disc just chatters in the drive?</fontfamily>

<fontfamily><param>Arial</param>Any suggestions?</fontfamily>
