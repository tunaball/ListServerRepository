Well, the goal was to do a professional hinge repair so I opted to
“take apart everything”, instead of just bending up the display back
and insert new hinges that way. I still see the way I did it, as the
only way to get a good result, since everything is mounted in the back
of the display, and with the front bezel off you have total control
over hinges, shims, glues etc.


I did a lot of reading on how to take my TiBook apart – Apple service
manual and other sources – took all precautions (handling LVDS etc)
thinking this was the most difficult operation – obviously overlooking
how sensitive the lcd-panel is.


I “found” the second bezel when prying with the plastic strip in
front/over the gap caused by a broken (right) hinge. Suddenly, I see
the plastic tip coming out at “the bottom” of the lcd-unit
(thickness-wise), hitting the titanium back of the display. Imagine my
surprise expecting it too appear at “the top” of the lcd-unit
(thickness-wise), right under the front titanium/aluminum bezel frame!
The lcd-bezel is obviously having an L-profile causing my piece of
plastic to bend 90 degrees and potentially harm whatever is in that
area all around the panel? 


The reason for stubbornly trying to get the bezel off by prying on the
inner edge was to do as little harm as possible to the outer edge. I
have read that many destroy/bend this when taking the bezel off
resulting in ugly dents and difficult refitting.
