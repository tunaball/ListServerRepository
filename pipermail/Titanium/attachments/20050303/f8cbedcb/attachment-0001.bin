opportunity to Paint the TiBook edge.

I have had some serious color flaking at the plastic/carbon? edge and
took the opportunity to repaint the edge when everything was apart.
Took all the old two layers of color away, grinded and did some
serious masking before spraying. Looks really good – a lot better than
TiPaint etc! </color></fontfamily>
