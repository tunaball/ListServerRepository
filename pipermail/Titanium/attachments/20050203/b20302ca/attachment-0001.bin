<fontfamily><param>Hei</param><x-tad-smaller>Hi,

during last few weeks I have saved multiple reports such as:


</x-tad-smaller><x-tad-smaller>Command: Camino

Path:    /Applications/Camino.app/Contents/MacOS/Camino

Version: 0.8.2 (0.8.2int)

PID:     1231

Thread:  17


Exception:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (0x0001)

Codes:      KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS (0x0001) at 0x01f8e57c

<<snip>


in both work and home computing environments.


OSX is latest w/all previous bold updates in both cases. At home is
this Ti 667 and office G5 DP 1.8, so iron is no issue. Must be
something in sw- section. Or memory, but...


Any advice appreciated!


Regards,

Pete at Finland</x-tad-smaller></fontfamily><fontfamily><param>Helvetica</param><x-tad-smaller>
