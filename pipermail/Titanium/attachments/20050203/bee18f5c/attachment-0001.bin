<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><smaller><x-tad-smaller>First, I would
suggest going to the Home/Applications/Utilities folder and running
Disk Utility. Highlight your hard drive name on the left and clicking
on Repair Permissions. If it shows repairs to Camino then that was
probably the fix. Restart the computer for good measure.</x-tad-smaller></smaller></fontfamily></excerpt><excerpt>


<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><smaller><x-tad-smaller>If that does
not fix it trash Camino and download a new one. you could also run
TechTool Pro or Disk Warrior to check for directory damage of the hard
drive (probably not the problem but a good thing to do also).</x-tad-smaller></smaller></fontfamily></excerpt><excerpt>

Thanks Terry, 

sorry, I didn<fontfamily><param>Times</param>'t write about the dozen
or so other insidents happened with word, graphic conv., adobe family
etc. In G5 I've done permissions for whole drive, apps still hitting
pavement.

So, that excludes just redoing camino. 

I'm in hope of finding cure for similar symptoms fixed case. Well,
office beauty is going for shopping tomorrow and I am getting 2 GHz G5
as replacement : ) for a time at the geniusbar. Should do the same for
this Ti, but they don't make these any more ; ) Only in Al's, though.


Regards,
