<fontfamily><param>Verdana</param>Hello all,


Just destroyed my 667 DVI display (look below for symptoms) when
trying to do the most beautiful hinge repair ever (with good results –
the TiBook looks as new). 


First - the warning.

There is a "second bezel" under the bezel!


The ”second bezel” is an integrated part of the lcd-unit that the
front bezel is glued on to. Not knowing about its existence I ended up
prying with a thin strip of plastic under this (lcd-unit bezel). I
went on for quite a while (couple of hours - all along the inside
edge) before realizing this, and I guess this destroyed the lcd-unit.
After realizing “where I was” - prying ”between the bezels” made the
front bezel pop off in premium condition.


So - Watch out – or follow the macdan recommendation and try this on a
broken-LCD before.


Then - the Help Needed!

Symptoms: The display now lights up showing several thin vertical and
horizontal stripes. When in sleep mode ”the sleep light” pulse as it
should. I can se faint colour shifts and movements during use.
External screen works great as well as all other ports, track pad etc.
In addition to the stripes I have black marks of various sizes along
the lcd-edge. Those black marks does not light up at all and are also
visible when the TiBook is turned off.


I guess the black marks are from prying under the wrong bezel and/or
from clamping with to strong clamps when gluing it all together. The
stripes – I don’t have a clue (LVDS?).


Do you think (as I do) that the lcd-unit is destroyed?

Do you think the LVDS-cable also is destroyed?

Is there anything I can do to verify?

Is e-Bay the best place to find a replacement lcd?


Lots of questions - I hope you can help me out!
