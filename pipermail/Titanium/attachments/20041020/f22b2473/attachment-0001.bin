When I purchased my Apple Titanium Powerbook in June of 2003, I
thought I'd be able to make <bold>usable</bold> back-up DVDs of DVD
movies that we own.  My biggest need for this is with kids' movies as
my children often get their fingers on the dvds and have accidentally
scratched a couple of them.  Anyway, I cannot seem to figure out how
to copy DVD movies and the Apple Website Support pages are just not
very helpful for most things, to me.


Anyway, I'd appreciate your help!
