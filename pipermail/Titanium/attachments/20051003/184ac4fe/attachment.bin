No way........ it was definitely a screw driver. You can tell by the

<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><smaller> Impact was intense.  From
appearance the book was laying on its bottom on a soft surface like a
blanket or rug on a floor.  Trajectory of the ramming object looks
from top down centered on where the apple logo would be which seems
self evident from the location of screen fractures.   I would say
damage is from a foot fall but the overall look and the warping of the
case suggest a rounded, heavy impact object like a 16 pound bowling
ball dropped top down from a height of eight to ten feet off a balcony
overlooking a living room or an outdoor patio.  That said, it was
probably the programming computer of the MacIntel development team in
Cupertino...</smaller></fontfamily>_______________________________________________
