Listers:


Just to add to the woes, the
"<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>SecUpd2005-004" has an issue
that affects users with multiple accounts.  Any standard, or managed
accounts will not be able to log in after this update is installed.  I
don't how many of this list will be affected as for the most part, we
are all single (Admin) users on our powerbooks.  I just thought that I
would post it here as some of you (like me) may have kids with managed
or standard accounts using your laptop, or a desktop system back at
home.


Symptoms:  'Standard' or 'Managed' user tries to log in and never gets
beyond the first screen with the horizontal spinning Barber Pole.


The simple fix, until the apple engineers release a patch, is to turn
any 'Standard' or 'Managed' accounts into 'Admin' accounts in System
Preferences/Accounts.


Hope this saves someone out there some agony.
