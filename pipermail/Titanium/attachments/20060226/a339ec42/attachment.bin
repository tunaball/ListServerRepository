Had the same problem... it was the inverter board. You can get one on
ebay for cheap, or at http://www.ifixit.com for more money, but it's
guaranteed.


Then you'll have to change it yourself, which is pretty simple if you
know your way into electronic parts, pretty hard otherwise...


but you might have a friend who knows... otherwise it's the local
apple technician and the hard bill...


:o)


Good luck !
