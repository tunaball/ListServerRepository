I've put my titanium 800 DVI to the maximum :


1Gig of ram

7200rpm 80g hard drive

1gHz motherboard bought on ebay and installed it myself.


and you know what...


I still think it's slow... compared to what you can find today on the
market but hey... it's 4 years old...


:o)


I don't have enough money to buy a new one, so I'd really like to find
1gig ram sticks so I could upgrade to 2gigs, and 10000rpm hard
drives...

And a safe guide to overclocking my motherboard to 1.5gig...


:o)
