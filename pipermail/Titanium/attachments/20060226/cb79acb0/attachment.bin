Hi Tim, To know for sure if the inverter board is responsible, have a
look through the apple once the screen is dark. If you still see the
desktop very (VERY) faintly, it means that it's the inverter board. If
you see nothing... it's something else.


The inverter board controls the backlight of the screen, so it could
also be the backlight itself which fails, (but this is VERY rare, the
inverter board failure, on the other hand, is quite frequent ).


And, yes, unfortunately, it will die completely very soon. Mine lasted
3 weeks before I had to replace it.

Menawhile, you can still use the powerbook with an external screen
though.

To know if your powerbook is DVI, check the back plugs, if you have a
VGA plug and an infrared port, it's not DVI, if you have a DVI plug
and no infrared port then...


:o)


Good luck.
