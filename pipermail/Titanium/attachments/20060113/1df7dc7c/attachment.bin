No, of course not. 


But if there is even one software product you really need to use
sometimes, but won't run on a Mac, why not just buy a cheap Windoze
computer to run it on, rather than VirtualPC? Will the difference in
price really break the bank?

Windows will do everything Mac OS X will do, so just run the one

every time you need to switch application environments.</bigger></bigger>
