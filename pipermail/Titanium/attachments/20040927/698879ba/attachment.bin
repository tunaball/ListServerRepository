Hi guys,

Just got my Ti G4 back from Apple repair -- the yellow vertical line
is gone.  

They repaired it under warranty, thank the Mac Gods!


For you gurus, the Proof of Repair sheet reads:

<underline>Part number</underline>:

646-0221  DSPL  ASSY, 15.2, XGA, Q16, SAM, W4 REWKD

603-4549  FOAM DIFFUSER ASSY, PE, DSPL, PB15"


Oh it's nice to have it back!
