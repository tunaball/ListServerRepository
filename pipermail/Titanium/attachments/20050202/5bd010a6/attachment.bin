 Usually, I would say this is a hardware problem, like the
interconnect between the motherboard and the display. However, I am
starting to notice brief flickers of the display also, but oddly, it
only happens when the CPU is busy doing something or the disk is
seeking. I can't get it to flicker by mechanical tapping or slight
twisting.

With Photoshop 7 in OS X, when I rotated a layer, my screen would
occasionally static out - horizontal lines would flicker across the
screen. This hasn't happened since I upgraded to CS.

Thanks for your comments!


Yes, I do agree to your opinions about possible "bus flood" in
conjunction with hardwear malfunction. 

If I have good luck of determining any graphics cord loosening etc.
during following weekend, I will post those findings into this helpful
list. 


Happily I grew up taking things apart..and sometimes putting all back
to square w/success, I<fontfamily><param>Times</param>'m prominent
enough to take this dear thing apart too :) And happily again, there
is plenty of documents available regarding display, logic board and
its connectors/peripherals.
