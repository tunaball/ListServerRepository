I used a semi-gloss off-white color to paint the edge and the two
hinge covers. There is no metallic look in the color - but that was
impossible to find. I asked in several places and tryed out four
different colors before painting. I wanted a good match as well as a
good and strong surface. I left the bottom part of the screen (it was
unscratched) and the two hinge-ends (brand new) as they were.  Color
can be fond with info at http://www.hagmans.se/eng/index.asp go in
under "carcare" then "lacquers" then "Halvblank/Semi-gloss, White
400ml", paint code (art nr) 11431. Data and saftey sheet available as
pdf. Takes 5 days to dry completely.


Difficult part was masking all tiny details that could not be
seperated from the frame (airPort-antenna-Plastics) - I recommend a
sharp knife/scalpell . Masked under hinges as well as over all ports
under the back cover.


I havent been able to test the durability. My computer is placed on
top of my stereo as a permanent recording unit hooked up with an
external display and cordless keyboard/mouse.


good luck!

I have had some serious color flaking at the plastic/carbon? edge and
took the opportunity to repaint the edge when everything was apart.
Took all the old two layers of color away, grinded and did some
serious masking before spraying. Looks really good – a lot better than
TiPaint etc! </color>_______________________________________________
