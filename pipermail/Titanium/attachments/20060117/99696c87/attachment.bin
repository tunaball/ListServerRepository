No studies, but literally millions of deployments speaks for itself.

</excerpt>Does it really? Or is it marketing that is the cause of
these "many more millions of deployments"?


Speaking as a certified scientist and an amateur logician, I
*<bold><italic>personally</italic></bold>* would not accept "many more
millions of deployments" as proof of anything ... except, of course,
of many more millions of deployments. But then again, maybe that's
just me.


<excerpt>Windows is the hands down winner. Windows application
developers have been able to deploy solutions and move from revision
to revision pretty much seamlessly over the years, with only minor
glitches aka Windows XP SP2.

</excerpt>I was speaking of
*<bold><italic>reliability</italic></bold>*: not of moving over "from
revision to revision". OIOW, I was wondering how many times the
average Windows user has to stop the work he is doing to solve
computer problems, as compared with the average Mac user.


<excerpt>Apple, OTOH has jumped ship too many times. The transition
from Apple to Mac made all Apple software obsolete. Then we went from
68K to PPC, then OS 9 to OS X, then PPC to Intel, each time adding
complexity, development cost, and alienating legacy users and
developers.

</excerpt>I dunno about that. I can still use all the OS 7.2 software
I bought for my Performa back in 1997!


<excerpt>Reliability in Enterprise and business has way factors than
just technical excellence.

</excerpt>No doubt. But I was just wondering in my post which platform
is the more reliable, not which is the technically more excellent. (I
*<bold><italic>know</italic></bold>* that the Mac OS is technically
more excellent than Windows!)



Cheers.
