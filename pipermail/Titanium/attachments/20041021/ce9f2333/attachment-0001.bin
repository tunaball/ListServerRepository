Hi Vicki


Brian's Suggestion is one way to go, here is another...


For free download DVD Backup 1.3, here is the url on version tracker


http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/18599


This program, weighing in at 94k, will suck the DVD onto your HD and
remove all copy protection and region encoding.

It is an small and very easy program to use. Be sure that you are
doing this with your own bought DVD's :-)


If the resulting Video_TS folder is under 4Gb or so in size, you can
then burn the Video_TS folder straight to a DVD-R.


If the Video_TS folder is bigger than 4.5GB then you can use a program
called DVD2oneX, here is its url on Versiontracker


http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/19238


This is a pay for program €49 or about $60

It will take the DVD you have ripped with DVD Backup and recomposes it
to fit on a DVD-R

It is also an easy to use program

On 20 Oct 2004, at 14:11, Vicky Quinn asked the question:


<excerpt>When I purchased my Apple Titanium Powerbook in June of 2003,
I thought I'd be able to make <bold>usable</bold> back-up DVDs of DVD
movies that we own.  My biggest need for this is with kids' movies as
my children often get their fingers on the dvds and have accidentally
scratched a couple of them.  Anyway, I cannot seem to figure out how
to copy DVD movies and the Apple Website Support pages are just not
very helpful for most things, to me.


Anyway, I'd appreciate your
help!_______________________________________________</excerpt>
