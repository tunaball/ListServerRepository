The Bluetooth Device is ok on all the other Macs. I have a MacBook  
Pro with the Intel dual, a new iMac, a 4 yr old G5 bought exactly  
when the new Cinema Displays came out - bought the new one instead of  
getting the older version with a big discount. (If I listed all the  
Macs I have we'd be here all day) This is my private machine where no  
one else has access.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Scott, thanks for responding. I do have the Missing Sync for the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PDA before the World Edition Blackberry. I used it for the last  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sony Clie and it was usually pretty good. I was able to use  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vindigo on it also. One big problem though - the Ti had been sent  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Apple and when it was returned, they had installed a slightly  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different OS and I can not get the HotSync to work at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So Apple wiped it?  If so, you could back up your files, and wipe  
</I>&gt;<i> it again with the OS disc you have, in the version that was  
</I>&gt;<i> working.  I don't think you can downgrade the OS without reformatting.
</I>
I took it to the Apple store and they sent it out for the one price  
fix all which included a new HD, new USB, Firewire, Optical Drive,  
broken hinge and a few other things that went &quot;bad.&quot; Personally I  
think they just sent me a different machine. This had already been to  
Apple before because the paint that goes around the perimeter of the  
lower half had peeled and cracked horrendously.  Even though I had a  
full backup of my system, I paid the extra so that they could also  
back up and then re-install. The newly installed system was for  
another powerbook - a few things were different.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is possible that it was something else they did to the machine  
</I>&gt;<i> killed the hotsync, and not the OS change.  You might be able to  
</I>&gt;<i> test the hotsync just by booting from your OS CD (see above) to  
</I>&gt;<i> rule out that issue.
</I>
I will have to find the original CD and boot up with that and also  
run disc repair/aid. I have Disk Warrior which I haven't run in quite  
a while, so perhaps do that too.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Missing Sync is very particular about OS 10.4 and what order things  
</I>&gt;<i> need to be done when upgrading to it.  Do you have 10.3, 4, or 5?
</I>
I have 10.4.11  - I literally have no more space on the machine to  
upgrade. I'm down to 1 gig of free space and where I could leave this  
thing in sleep mode for weeks at a time without rebooting, I now have  
to reboot either once a day or if lucky I can get 2 days.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Missing Sync relies on Palm Software, and without the two  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important components for the Conduits - it will not work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but only for syncing with a Palm device.  As you mentioned  
</I>&gt;<i> below, you should not need it for the Blackberry.  That version of  
</I>&gt;<i> Missing Sync should come with whatever it needs.  You might not be  
</I>&gt;<i> able to have the Palm version installed at the same time as the  
</I>&gt;<i> Blackberry version.  I don't know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I'd explore the USB issue first.  Then if they all check  
</I>&gt;<i> out, go after the syncing problems.
</I>
I'll give it all a try. I rely heavily on this machine and without  
working USB ports, I can't update the iPod, upload my digital photos,  
etc.

Btw .... in the pile of iPods, I swim every day with the last version  
of the iPod before the touch came out. I have a waterproof cover and  
today I discovered that there are rusty spots on the bottom around  
the opening that plugs into the charger.

When it rains, it pours.

Thanks again
