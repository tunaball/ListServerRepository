<PRE>I should have answered this a long time ago, but here it goes.

&gt;<i> Well, the off backlighting is most likely the inverter board, but if
</I>&gt;<i> you're sure you don't see anything in the bottom of the display - please
</I>&gt;<i> make sure you have something there you know how it looks - then it's
</I>&gt;<i> possible that the display itself could have been damaged AND/OR that
</I>&gt;<i> your display cables have been damaged. Where is the white during
</I>&gt;<i> startup? Is it the same upper 30% partial or the whole screen? When you
</I>&gt;<i> look with a bright light, does the part you see looks like it should or
</I>&gt;<i> is it warped somehow?
</I>
The part that I see is in the upper 30%. It pretty much looks like it
should. As that part emits quite a bit of light, I have not been able to
make out much in the lower 60%. The light part seems to only show part of
the screen, though I can not confirm it is the exact same part it should
show.


&gt;<i> Only way to know for sure is to try with another inverter board or move
</I>&gt;<i> the display itself to another known working titanium machine, if the
</I>&gt;<i> display is likely to be working.
</I>
Both are a bit of a problem. I don't have another titanium machine and I
don't have any spare parts either.

&gt;<i> If it's worth the effort is up to you, but I can give you advice from
</I>&gt;<i> the experience I have had with this type of problem if you need it. As
</I>&gt;<i> I've had 3 boards or so  that needed replacement it does seem like a
</I>&gt;<i> typical Titanium problem, at least with the second generation.
</I>
Ok. I am doubting what I should do. It depends on whether I get my new
company off the ground as well and whether we can get the investements
needed. I might just leave it at this for now and see whether I would
accidentally bump into an inverter board. The big screen behind it does
work, so it is usable for testing purposes at the moment.

Thanks,

Arne
