</I>-----------
I have had to sent in a few reports to Apple since 10.3.4 and Java 
1.4.2 but I'm prefer Camino and since I installed their update 0.8 
about the same time I thought sometimes Camino was the culprit. Usually 
I don't get total freeze, though it happens, but Camino or Safari (use 
for certain sites) craches and occationally can't be restarted without 
me restarting the whole Ti 400/ 768Mb/40Gb HD.

Sometimes a forced restart of Finder will be enough to get things 
working again but I can sence that something is a bit funny until I do 
a proper restart.

Had a little bit of similar fuss in the beginning of 10.3.2 (?) but 
that got better with the security updates. In the same time I' aware of 
that I haven't done a clean install since I bought the Ti in 2002(?). 
Even when I istalled the new 40 HD I only made a CarbonCopy from the 
old 10 HD, so I feel I have no right to complain unless I do that 
first.

Thought I let you know that you not entirely alone. :-) I carefully do 
all repair stuff before and after updates and don't think I have 
anything added that could do something to the system. Certainly not 
having anything not ordinary running when the problem occurs.

Can make my Ti very unhappy however by having iPhoto, PhotoShop 
Elements, GraphicConverter running at the same times as 2 or 3 browsers 
plus Mail and Texthandler. An hour or so in to that load one or the 
other or Finder itself will complain and need a forced close and after 
saving the rest a restart. But that i accept as limitations to a now 
old (*patting it kindly*) Tibook.
