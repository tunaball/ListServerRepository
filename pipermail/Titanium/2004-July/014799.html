<PRE>well, i got a 'old' TiBook g4 400 as well ... with only 384mb ram ....
usually open are safari, mail, itunes, bittorrent, fire and other 
little stuff ... occassionally photoshop and golive....
the ram of 384mb is (of course) way not enough - did i mention i run 
panther?
i get a complete system freeze maybe once or twice a year .... safari 
gives me the spinning wheel ... but only on certain homepages or after 
too long uptime of the app .... then a quit and restart of safari does 
the job for me ....
i installed menumeters on my mac, to check the bandwith output ... also 
cpu rate and memory  is in there .... VERY interesting for me to see 
.... if it reaches a certain level i know i have to restart safari and 
voil&#224; there is more RAM again ....

i can't understand why they still have issues with memory loss in 
safari ... is it just badly written? i don't know (don't know much 
about writing apps)

the mentioned problem of freezing/hanging so often is sad and i can 
luckily say that i don't have that prob ..... luckily, because panther 
is probably the last os on this mac =)

</I>&gt;<i> having anything not ordinary running when the problem occurs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can make my Ti very unhappy however by having iPhoto, PhotoShop 
</I>&gt;<i> Elements, GraphicConverter running at the same times as 2 or 3 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers plus Mail and Texthandler. An hour or so in to that load one 
</I>&gt;<i> or the other or Finder itself will complain and need a forced close 
</I>&gt;<i> and after saving the rest a restart. But that i accept as limitations 
</I>&gt;<i> to a now old (*patting it kindly*) Tibook.
