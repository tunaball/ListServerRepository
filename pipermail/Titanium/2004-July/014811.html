I'll have to try that.  I didn't think that worked.  If it does that 
would be perfectly acceptable, however, since it would eliminate the 
reboot to OS 9.  IIRC, in Win98 to use the included drivers for SRAM in 
\drivers\storage\ftl\trueffs.inf you had to:

Remove all SRAM cards from the PC Card socket
Right click on \drivers\storage\ftl\trueffs.inf This will create a 
directory in your windows directory called TFFS9X
Once this directory is installed, all of the necessary drivers are 
installed.
Add LASTDRIVE=Z statement in the CONFIG.SYS
Restart your system

Yes, I get that little TV-looking icon in the menu bar.  It shows I 
stuck in a Centennial Technologies card and I can power it off or on.  
But I can't access the files on it from OS X.  Somehow I need to be 
able to mount that thing in Finder so I can get the files off the card. 
  Perhaps I'm overlooking something obvious.  I'd even be happy with the 
command line as long as I wouldn't have to reboot to OS 9.  But I've 
looked in /Volumes and it doesn't appear to mount the card anywhere so 
I get to the file that's stored on it  - just knows it's in the slot.
