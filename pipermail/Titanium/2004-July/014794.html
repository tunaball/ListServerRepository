nuendo - is that like SX 2 on steroids??

i understand that SX 2 has Nuendo's engine?

right on - VST plugs...  MMMmmmmm.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I always considered Cubase to be a &quot;PC app&quot;, still do.
</I>
didn't used to be...  used to be Atari, then Mac, then PC...  =)

</I>
well - if all a person wants to do is use their computer like a 2&quot; 
multitrack recorder - then simpler IS better...  but back then, you 
couldn't convince me in a million years that 16bit DAW's were sounding 
good enough yet...

but if you were trying to make music that did not exist in the 'real 
world'...  the more complicated the software was - the better...  
usually the complex software let you do things that were just not 
possible on the 'click-here-to-record' DAW's...

anyway - this is why i use Reason for my main writing tool - the 
possibilities are literally endless...

&gt;<i> I switched to Performer, then Digital Performer, for at home work. 
</I>&gt;<i> MOTU and Native Instruments (especuially NI), are my favorite things 
</I>&gt;<i> in audio.
</I>
is Absynth NI?  that synth - ever since it got Granular Synthesis is 
THE BOMB!   I would love to slap the Propellerheads for NOT including a 
REAL granular synthesizer...  Malstrom is a WEAK implementation of a 
granular synth - and what's with no-user-samples ??

=)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Was born and raised on the Left Coast
</I>
i'm sorry...

(kidding)

&gt;<i> , so I tend to favor Western-oriented apps over the MIT Unix, and 
</I>&gt;<i> Steinbergs, etc.
</I>
in the electronic music world the complexity is an awesome production 
tool.

but for Guitar-Drums-Bass-Vox music - the other apps are great.

&gt;<i>  But, I agree completely, it's a matter of taste,
</I>
and sometimes it's a matter of first introduction...

&gt;<i>  and I think a lot of the &quot;this vs. that&quot; stuff has to do with people 
</I>&gt;<i> being naturally prejudiced in favor of what they themselves use.
</I>
sure a plumber is going to prefer his plunger, whilst the Dog Trainer 
will prefer the radio-collar =)
&gt;<i>
