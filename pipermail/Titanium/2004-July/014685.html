<PRE>Hi John,
I have expected this for some time since all Norton Utilities and 
System whatever has only barely been playing catch-up with all of the 
recent OS X updates. I haven't really seen a product worth purchasing 
for the Mac in over 3 years from Symantec. Thankfully Tech Tools has 
been very on top of updating and reliability.

I won't be missing Peter Norton's cartoon image with a stethoscope 
checking my hard drive for problems that it never really fixed all that 
well anyway. In their own way, Symantec is going the way of OS 9, not 
needed any longer.

While I am in the ranting phase (is it a full moon?) I just read that
Symantec has yanked support for the Mac except for Anti-Virus software
(which must really tax their brains!).

Some of us can remember some really excellent utility software from
companies like 5th Generation and Delrina and the MacTools group that 
were
acquired by Symantec just as they were at their peek. What did they do 
with
this really great technology? They killed it to give them a virtual 
monopoly
in the Mac Utilities field. Now they have pulled the plug and left
multitudes that rely on Norton to protect, maintain and optimize their
systems dangling in the breeze!

Really disgusting and indefensible business practice in my humble 
opinion.
