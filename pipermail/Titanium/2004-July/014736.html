<PRE>Richard,
Whinge? :-)

No problem!  Just projecting from my experience with Apple/canada over 
the years and what its left me to conclude.

Do I really care about iTunes, no not that much, as I said .mac is of 
much more use to me, but its other things about Apple in Canada which 
leave me wondering sometimes.

Still, as it concerns iTunes, it seems to me Canada is a good market 
(who would argue?).
We are &quot;right next door&quot; (technologically, infrastructurally 
interwoven), have a substantial purchasing segment, with a &quot;free trade 
act&quot; (designed and in place for quite a long while now to facilitate 
just such developments)

So I think its fair to wonder about why buying through an iTunes apple 
Canada store is still not here and perhaps not just chalk it up to
market numbers.  I mean apple does want to make money, no? :-)
______________________________
Warning Conspiracy Theories below:

**Perhaps Steve didn't get the free canadian beer he was promised by 
some canadian singer? (Nelly F. or Neil Y. was that you?)  :-)  and has 
decided to retaliate.
**Perhaps the hollywood movie industry is pressuring Steve to ignore 
Canada, because Canadians have been taking their film location away and 
this is hollywoods  way to hit back :-)  (and no one sent him free 
canadian beer either)
**Perhaps a then young Steve is still mad at Lorne Green because Green 
(a Canadian) didn't give him his autograph after meeting Green 
(Canadian) onset at a Bonanza filming?
** Perhaps its because Steve always wanted to be a comedian and nearly 
all the good one's are Canadian and he knows it's impossible (and he 
still can't get free canadian beer, never mind he could buy all the 
breweries in Canada) :-)

Who knows??????
_______________________________

Perhaps more explicit explanations  from Apple Canada/US (as well as 
others involved) might be considered a courtesy to both their regular 
customers and potential customers (all those wide eyed windows users 
who really want to buy an ipod and buy music in Canada).
I am wasting my time writing about it but I don't lose sleep over it.

Apple does of course hold their &quot;cards&quot; close to the chest, so who 
knows why? (see Conspiracy theories above).

However, as mentioned, and what I think Murray was getting at, is that 
the iTunes situation (or is that non situation) seems indicative of 
other situations concerning Apple in Canada.  It's doesn't seem just a 
matter of not being a big enough market.

Anyway
have a good one or as they sometimes say
&quot;have a good day, eh!&quot; :-)

cheers,
tim
