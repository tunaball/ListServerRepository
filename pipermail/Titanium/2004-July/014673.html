<PRE>Howdy,

&gt;<i> Ti LCDs are regularly available on eBay for ~US$200-250, and frequently
</I>&gt;<i> for less (I just snapped one up for $149.)
</I>
Unfortunately, it's rare where an ebay seller in the US will be willing to 
ship internationally.  Also, most of these screens are pre-DVI 1152x768 
panels.

&gt;<i> The bezel face can be replaced using an adhesive suitable for glueing
</I>&gt;<i> metal to metal. I'd _NOT_ use epoxy. I don't know what Apple used, but
</I>&gt;<i> the original stuff is thin, brown, hard and brittle. For starters, I'd
</I>&gt;<i> suggest common household cement. Here the states Duco is a widely
</I>&gt;<i> available name brand, but anything similar ought to work.
</I>
Thanks.  Will see what I can dig up.

&gt;<i> You might want to test-practice with the old broken LCD before the final
</I>&gt;<i> assembly to determine the appropriate amount of glue to use. It always
</I>&gt;<i> enhances one's confidence level when you can practice first. :-D
</I>
Probably a good idea - this stuff shouldn't take any more than a few hours 
to set?

&gt;<i> Run a thin bead of glue around the LCD frame's face, being careful to
</I>&gt;<i> keep the glue more to the LCD's outer edge than the inner (you want
</I>&gt;<i> minimize squeeze-out onto the LCD screen.) Position the bezel face on the
</I>&gt;<i> LCD and using _lots_ of clips (springloaded clothespins are perfect)
</I>&gt;<i> clamp all around. Might be a good idea to wipe off any squeeze-out
</I>&gt;<i> _before_ it dries, though if you've masked well that may not be necessary.
</I>
I'm still unclear on how one would mask the screen against squeeze-out.

&gt;<i> If the LCD data cable is intact I'd suggest not dismantling the 'Book to
</I>&gt;<i> remove the cable, just do the LCD replacement with the bezel back and
</I>&gt;<i> hinges still in place. Removing the data cable from its internal
</I>&gt;<i> connector requires nearly complete disassembly of the 'Book and is to
</I>&gt;<i> avoided if possible.
</I>
Done that yesterday and I'm not too keen on doing so again!  The machine is 
a 1GHz last-gen tibook (which is why I'm not terribly keen on replacing it, 
given that it's still got a month of warranty left (assuming opening the 
machine didn't void the warranty - which it probably did).  Fortunately the 
LVDS cable still works and I got the whole machine back together and it 
works a treat.  Not for the faint at heart, even with a service manual.

&gt;<i> Ahh, heck with all that, just buy a new AlBook!
</I>
I'd love to - however, I'd prefer to hang on till the G5 models or a G4 
model with digital audio out so I can mix multichannel audio on the machine 
itself.

&gt;<i> PS: I've _got_ to add the above directions (with pics) to my web page,
</I>&gt;<i>     I'll get to that . . . errr, eventually :-}
</I>
Copy and paste?

Anyways, thanks for your help - definitely food for thought.  I'll see if 
I've got the cash for a new screen and will go ahead with the panel removal 
if I can confirm that I do.

thanks again.
