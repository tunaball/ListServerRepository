&gt;<i> Whinge? :-)
</I>
Sorry, been here too long already...caught myself calling a car trunk a
'boot' recently as well...help!

Whinge: to complain fretfully according to Merriam Webster, the brits love
doing it and are good at it :)

&gt;<i> No problem!  Just projecting from my experience with Apple/canada over
</I>&gt;<i> the years and what its left me to conclude.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do I really care about iTunes, no not that much, as I said .mac is of
</I>&gt;<i> much more use to me, but its other things about Apple in Canada which
</I>&gt;<i> leave me wondering sometimes.
</I>
Know what you mean, the UK is Mac Nirvana in comparison to home. When I
visit the parents I see Macs all over the place in the airports but try to
get something at a store in the local town (or even in the city) and it can
be frustrating.

&gt;<i> Still, as it concerns iTunes, it seems to me Canada is a good market
</I>&gt;<i> (who would argue?).
</I>
Certainly not me, I would suggest that the proportion of buyers to pop.
Numbers would be higher than in other countries like those in the EU...but
unfortunately neither of us is working for Apple or in marketing...maybe
there are indeed other factors we don't know about...

&gt;<i> **Perhaps Steve didn't get the free canadian beer he was promised by
</I>&gt;<i> some canadian singer?
</I>
&gt;<i> ** Perhaps its because Steve always wanted to be a comedian and nearly
</I>&gt;<i> all the good one's are Canadian and he knows it's impossible (and he
</I>&gt;<i> still can't get free canadian beer, never mind he could buy all the
</I>&gt;<i> breweries in Canada) :-)
</I>
Well spotted! Or he saw the South Park movie and was upset because Pixar
didn't get the rights to it (and no one sent him any Canadian beer)?
 
&gt;<i> Perhaps more explicit explanations  from Apple Canada/US (as well as
</I>&gt;<i> others involved) might be considered a courtesy to both their regular
</I>&gt;<i> customers and potential customers (all those wide eyed windows users
</I>&gt;<i> who really want to buy an ipod and buy music in Canada).
</I>&gt;<i> I am wasting my time writing about it but I don't lose sleep over it.
</I>
Valid point. Nothing is wasted, things change with communication...

&gt;<i> However, as mentioned, and what I think Murray was getting at, is that
</I>&gt;<i> the iTunes situation (or is that non situation) seems indicative of
</I>&gt;<i> other situations concerning Apple in Canada.  It's doesn't seem just a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of not being a big enough market.
</I>
Agreed. Let's hope things change for the better, besides, what better way to
use the PowerBook capabilities than to enjoy music and let creativity flow.
 
&gt;<i> &quot;have a good day, eh!&quot; :-)
</I>
Take off, you hoser :-)

Cheers,

Richard
