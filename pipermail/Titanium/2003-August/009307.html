I have been buying computer &quot;packages&quot; (personal Mac shopper!) for edu 
people who have been given only so much money to spend. I have gotten 
them refurbs and models that are on the cusp and was able to throw in 
things like mice, floppy drives, carry cases, and printers and cables 
for them. I then run them and set them up for a week, update them, burn 
a CD with all the updates and extras, and off they go!
You should really shop around. My people usually are granted around 
$1,500 total so I have to be a very good shopper.

Just a note that will make you nuts: One lady just got her new iBook 
&quot;package&quot; from me (thanks to a grant) and loves it although she is not 
a computer &quot;nut&quot; and has to ask me over and over how to do this or 
that....they also just gave her a Palm Tungsten. Then lo and behold, 
another department of the &quot;institution&quot; gave her another new laptop 
with a 17&quot; screen. She was upset because she has no idea what to do 
with one computer let alone all these computers or where they get the 
money for them! She is the last person to need two computers.
And you thought the economy was bad! :-)
