<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>What are the best alternative you have found, esp. in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the realm of hybrid connectivity (PC and Macs sharing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the same wireless connection).  Cost is not an issue;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>however, quality and realiability are.  I'm not on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>802-g, but a router that has that flexibility built in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>is a plus.
</I>
here is my brief, layman's overview of wireless, based on installing 
5 wireless networks for home and/or small business use. While this in 
no way makes me an expert, it has required me to read a few tech 
notes, spend some time with various tech support and generally figure 
out how to get bits to play well with each other.

802.11b vs. 802.11g:

First, the trade off between version b and g speed is distance; on 
Apple's new Airport Xtreme, g distance drops to 50 feet (150 feet for 
b); similar drops in distance are standard in other routers that 
offer both b and g.  Version b operates at 10baseT ethernet speed, so 
even with a fast broadband connection, speed differences &quot;might&quot; be 
noticed with 4 or more computers continuously downloading files. 
While there have been some anecdotal reports of speed increases with 
version g, these or more likely caused by poor signal or other 
factors rather than the actual change in signal.

Version g is advantageous in small offices because shared connections 
are generally within the range of g and often require 4 or more 
devices. In addition, filesharing between those computers could also 
benefit from the fast g connection, which I believe is 100baseT 
ethernet equivalent.

One way to offset the distance loss with the new Airport X as well as 
most newer wireless routers is with an external antenna; these can be 
had starting at about $70.  Most wireless routers come with external 
antennae, which is why their distance ratings are much higher than 
Airport X out of the box

Compatibility:

Since the 802.11 is an adopted standard (pioneered by Apple) in 
wireless data transfer, there should be no problem connecting 
wireless devices. HAHAHAHAHA!  While I have found this to be almost 
true, there are some issues with WEP (wireless encryption protocol). 
We put a Linksys wireless PC card in a Windows laptop and tried 
connecting to the Airport Extreme network. Including and hour with 
Linksys tech support, we could find no way to connect to the Airport 
with WEP enabled. This client chose to keep WEP disabled, as it was a 
home network, and they used non-trivial passwords on all their 
devices leaving only the actual wireless connection open; if someone 
wanted to warchalk their wireless connection they would have to park 
obviously on their suburban side street.

I am currently using DLink products in my home and office network, 
and there is no problem with WEP from them to Macs; so whether this 
is an Apple issue or a Linksys issue or a Windows issue, 
unfortunately it would be a mark against the Airport Extreme if your 
Windows devices are using (at least some)Linksys products and you 
require a secure network.

Comparisons:

I am an Apple Evangelist and I really like the look of the new 
Airport, but there are only 2 advantages to the Airport that make it 
worth its EXTREME price:
- Style (if your wireless network is in your living room and you 
don't want some ugly tin/plastic box hanging on your wall.)

- USB printer sharing.  The USB/Rendezvous connection on the Airport 
makes sharing a USB printer a breeze (and yes, the Windows laptop 
could print to the device too). However, a note to those with 
&quot;All-in-one&quot; printers, only the print functions work. The scan/fax 
software looks to the physical USB port for the device.

I am currently a big fan of DLink products; their support is average, 
but it is generally average. Their Mac support seems equal to their 
Windoze support. They have a wireless router that is browser 
configurable, has 4 additional ethernet ports for non-wireless 
connections and two external antennae for around $70.  This router 
also supports bridging, which is also supported in the new Airport 
Extremes, but not in older Airport Base stations.

Bridging is connecting two or more networks wirelessly.  If this is 
something that is important to you, make sure to check the wireless 
device SPECIFICALLY for that feature as most cheaper routers DO NOT 
support bridging.  An example where bridging is needed: my house and 
my office are separated by about 100 feet, though on the same 
property. I have multiple computers in both locations, so I connected 
wirelessly between the two buildings using a bridge.
