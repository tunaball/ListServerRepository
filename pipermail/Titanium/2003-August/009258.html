David,

Let me take a crack at summarizes what you should have set up based on your
conversation with Woz:

1) Base station Network preferences should be normal Ethernet DHCP, assuming
your ISDN modem is assigning your base station an IP number through NAT.
This is how many of them work. So your base station is set with a private
NAT address &quot;probably&quot; in the 192.168.0.x range.

2) Airport Network Port configuration should be off as it's not needed in
this case on the base station Network Preferences.

3) Internet Sharing should be on , on the base station where  &quot;Share Your
Internet Connection...&quot; is checked.

4) Click on the Airport Options to give your Airport network a name and to
set Encryption and password options if needed.

5) Click the Start button. Your Airport Network should be operational.

6) On the Remote machine you should be able to connect to the Base Station
if your Airport is turned on and DHCP is set in the Network Preferences. IT
will probably assign you an Ip in the 10.x.x.x range.

The only hitch I see in this setup is NAT-NAT routing at the base station.
You have a NAT router with the ISDN modem/router assigning your base station
a Private NAT address and the Base station assigning your remote machine a
NAT IP number possibly in the same range.

This may be why you can't connect to the internet because there is an
attempt to route NAT-NAT through your BS.

Check the IP number on your base station. If it's in the same range as your
remote machine then this may be the problem - they can't be in the same
range.  (are they both in the 10.x.x.x range?)

The only workaround that I can figure would be to log onto the ISDN router
via it's web interface and change the NAT address scheme if that is possible
to use the 192.168.x.x scheme. You can't change the Base station range as
far as I know.

In the long run I'm not sure you can route NAT-NAT with simple router
configurations like we're dealing with. I suspect you would need a more
robust router and some static routing tables configured. If anyone knows a
simple workaround, now would be a good time to jump in.
