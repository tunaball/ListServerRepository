<PRE>Eduard Hoenkamp paused, thought it over, and spoke thusly:

&gt;<i>Pedro Vera mused:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>My usual rebuttal is a Mac laptop allows me to carry no less than 4 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>operating systems into one device...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hmmm... You just told your Windows users they need 4 OS's to work a 
</I>&gt;<i>Mac, whereas they can obviously do everything with just one system...
</I>
Everything? Obviously?

Like:

* Making a pdf from anything one can print? From applications all 
across the board?

* Or maybe it's possible on windoze to test an authored web site on 
Unix, Win95 -XP, Mac OS 7 - 10.2 browsers, on one machine, for 
browser/coding compatibility? When did MS start that? I do it all the 
time on a single laptop.

My neighbor is a web designer with partitions running Unix, OS X, and 
6 varieties of complete windows OS's...on  a $400 (used) G3 from 
Apple. &lt;--an oldie, that

* Or, did Microsoft get their Color Calibration sorted out while i 
was sleeping last night? Have they 'discovered' Pantone yet? &lt;laughs&gt;

* Are they including sound and video editing software (free of 
charge) that works yet?

* And how about Fonts? Would you like to buy the fonts Apple 
includes, for free? If a Windows user needed pro fonts they could buy 
two fully-loaded G5's for the roughly 10 grand that TT equivalents 
would cost, but I wouldn't suggest it, as their own version of 
Palatino can't even display correctly on the most tricked-out (i.e. 
expensive) XP Pro-equipped box in the world. We've taken sound, 
graphics and color calibration for granted for over a decade, and 
they still don't have it right.

When did they clear up that built-in virus network called outlook? 
yesterday? Mail.app is leaner, more powerful, and more secure.

let me go check and see if there's a 'security update' that came out 
this morning that includes column browsing in its system file 
navigation....oops, not yet.... They must be too busy 'innovating'..

Where's the &quot;Services&quot; function that allows proprietary and 
third-party apps to share system resources, without respect to who 
made what?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have tried two approaches, a technological, and a psychological. 
</I>&gt;<i>The former did not work for me, the latter did. And perhaps it also 
</I>&gt;<i>applies better to the typical Mac user on the defense (who does not 
</I>&gt;<i>carry 4 OS's around). I'd like to end my part of the thread, but 
</I>&gt;<i>remain curious to hear of others who tried the approach. Thanks for 
</I>&gt;<i>your input Pedro, and if it works for you, that's quite okay. Eduard.
</I>
Face it, Eduardo, in the same manner as most Wintel trolls, you 
mistake slightly out-dated advantages in the gaming market for 
'serious' business, design, and research, computing. And so do the 
'defensive' Windows users and Mac apologists. When you corner these 
guys it always comes down to &quot;There's more games on a PC&quot;.  This, 
from the same folks who brought you the &quot;Mac is a toy&quot; BS. Which is 
it?

Only a Mac user with some unrelated psychological problems would ever 
apologize for not being locked into one operating system. Talk about 
reverse logic, sheesh. That's the sort of thinking that drives the 
state department these days... you know, occupation=liberation, 
attacking=defending, working people are struggling because the rich 
don't have enough money, etc.

I remember the days when big time designers and effects people were 
using SGI and SPARCstations to render material that was created on a 
Mac. Gee, if they had those wicked 'powerful' machines to render on, 
how come they didn't use one for the main work? Hmmm, maybe because 
the Mac laid it all right out there. Maybe because the idea is to 
accomplish work, not to spend time trying to figure out the 
'instrument', itself.  Maybe because the Mac was simply...better.

Why else would a group of users who outnumber the Mac users by a 
ratio of 30 to 1, be so concerned with 'defending' their choice? Even 
McDonald's customers know they're eating trash. They don't find it 
necessary to explain to diners in decent restaurants that &quot;Yeah, but 
it only takes this long to eat!&quot;, or &quot;More people eat here than 
there&quot;. Who cares? Trash is trash, no matter how 'popular' it is.

The whole &quot;why do you use a Mac?&quot; thing reminds me of what Louis 
Armstrong said in reply to , &quot;What is jazz?&quot; He said, &quot;If you have to 
ask, you'll never know.&quot;

So, let 'em have their viruses and Nascar 2525's and SubUrban 
LumberYard ProXP.exe's, Eduard, and have fun. Now, I have work to do.
