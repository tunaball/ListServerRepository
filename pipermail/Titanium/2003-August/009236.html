It's faster on a LAN but I don't believe it on a Cable modem.


I stand corrected on the 5 vs 2.4 Ghz. However I stand by the statement that
you will not get faster throughput than what your internet connection is and
there is NO home internet connection that&#185;s faster than 11 Mb/s that I know
of. If you think you have one then I'd like to know where its at and who's
the provider. I've seen some business class DSL with 3-7 MB/s download but
I've never heard of this with a Cable modem.


The 11 MB/s is roughly equivalent to T-1 speeds. You're telling me you're
getting better than T-1 Speed on your cable modem?

It's very possible the better reception of the newer card is a factor. I
find that my Ti airport card throughput sucks if it's more than 10-15 feet
away from an APBS.
