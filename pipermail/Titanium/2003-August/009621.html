<PRE> I used this analogy on a friend who's wondering
 about going Mac or pc:
 Its like choosing between two hammers to hit a nail; 
 One has a heavier head but a handle full of splinters
 and the other has a lighter head with a beautiful smooth mahogony handle.
 They both do the same thing.

 So my friend went and bought a nail gun!  
 
 Go figure!.  :]

Subject: [Ti] what to say to Windows users:


Many of you must have experienced the mounting despair when defending 
the Mac to a PC user: I would go through the litany of who was first 
with windows, the mouse, the diskette, the 32 bit data path, the 
built-in network, and so forth. Or explain that PC's were only 
seemingly cheaper because they were bought on down payment; you 
afterwards had to buy boards that the Mac already came with. Or 
stress that our tax money too, went into the Y2K problem that did not 
plague our system, or that keeps flowing into erasing viruses that we 
are not affected by.

Lately I found something surprisingly effective, so I want to pass it 
on to those interested (hence no flames called for). In my heart of 
hearts it may feel different, but now I just say: &quot;The Mac is where 
Windows will be in about two years&quot;. In all occasions, that ended the 
discussion.
Eduard.
