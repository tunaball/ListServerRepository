<PRE>Compare the iSight (which has a 640X480 image.. cheesy specs these days) to
the Philips 740K (Which has a  megapixel CCD but costs only $69) or one of
the better Intel cams. It's not subjective thing, it simply is not in the
same category. Perhaps iSight 2.0 will be a modern camera. The current
iSight is beautiful to look at but the technology inside sucks.  BTW there
is NO good FireWire cam at this point. The best image cams are still all
USB, with the Philips and Intel cams clearly better that any of the others.

When I returned the iSight to the Apple Store in Atlanta, they were not at
all surprised.  This $149 dog is just a poor cam.

BTW the Philips can do 60 fps compared to the iSights 30. So frame rate is
not determined by the bus but by how well the throughput is managed.  The
Philips still manages to outperform every FireWire cam available in frame
rate as well as image quality.  I had them side by side while I struggled to
get he iSight to give a decent picture. After hours of tweaking it did not
even come close to the Philips.  I really wanted to like the iSight because
it would travel very well.  But....

&gt;<i> Sorry to disagree, but the picture I get is better than I have achieved
</I>&gt;<i> with any other firewire camera I've tried. As usual with these sorts of
</I>&gt;<i> things, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, In other words, ymmv, but
</I>&gt;<i> I think the picture is very good and the form factor is excellent.
