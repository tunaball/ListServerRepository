</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Are they including sound and video editing software (free of charge) 
</I>&gt;<i> that works yet?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * And how about Fonts? Would you like to buy the fonts Apple includes,

</I>&gt;<i> color calibration for granted for over a decade, and they still don't 
</I>&gt;<i> have it right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When did they clear up that built-in virus network called outlook? 
</I>&gt;<i> yesterday? Mail.app is leaner, more powerful, and more secure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> let me go check and see if there's a 'security update' that came out

</I>&gt;<i> Where's the &quot;Services&quot; function that allows proprietary and 
</I>&gt;<i> third-party apps to share system resources, without respect to who

The above is great...........tell me more!

&gt;<i> Face it, Eduardo, in the same manner as most Wintel trolls, you 
</I>&gt;<i> mistake slightly out-dated advantages in the gaming market for 
</I>&gt;<i> 'serious' business, design, and research, computing. And so do the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'defensive' Windows users and Mac apologists. When you corner these 
</I>&gt;<i> guys it always comes down to &quot;There's more games on a PC&quot;.  This, from 
</I>&gt;<i> the same folks who brought you the &quot;Mac is a toy&quot; BS. Which is it?
</I>
I LOVE IT!

&gt;<i> The whole &quot;why do you use a Mac?&quot; thing reminds me of what Louis 
</I>&gt;<i> Armstrong said in reply to , &quot;What is jazz?&quot; He said, &quot;If you have to 
</I>&gt;<i> ask, you'll never know.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, let 'em have their viruses and Nascar 2525's and SubUrban 
</I>&gt;<i> LumberYard ProXP.exe's, Eduard, and have fun. Now, I have work to do.

BRAVO!
