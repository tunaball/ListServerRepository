<PRE>We just got two of them and I'm having a great time with the 
technology.  iChatAV is still in beta, so the feature set isn't fully 
implemented, but what in place is working incredibly well.  The 
software is very stable.  As for the camera, it exudes quality from the 
very first touch.  The brushed aluminum design is nice.  I've seen 
several &quot;web cams&quot; that feel cheap and have marginal optics.  The 
iSight camera is top drawer.  I especially like how you can rotate the 
lens ring at the front of the camera and close the lens, yet the 
built-in microphone continues to work.  I also like the way iChatAV can 
tell what's happening with the camera and present that information on 
screen.  I guess this level of integration with software is a nice 
feature that's part of any FireWire device.  USB-based cameras can only 
wish to be this good.

In summary, I'd buy the iSight camera again without hesitation.  It is 
a flawless, state-of-the-art execution.  Although in 3-5 years, we may 
have more features on these kinds of products, it's works great and 
looks great now.  It will look really good with my G5, when it finally 
arrives in September (I hope).
