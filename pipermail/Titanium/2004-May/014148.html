I'm not sure I agree that this is ABS.  I agree it looks like ABS, but:

1.  I tried to weld a crack yesterday using Oatey ABS drain pipe cement and
clamping it together.  It did not work at all and showed no sign of
dissolving the plastic.  If it was ABS, it would have worked.

2.  ABS can have color molded in:

<A HREF="http://www.dow.com/automotive/materials/products/magnum/product.htm">http://www.dow.com/automotive/materials/products/magnum/product.htm</A>

We all know that painting this molding was one of the worst decisions Apple
engineers ever made, but why would they have specified painting if the color
could have been molded in?  (Possible bad answer: Metal in paint provides
electromagnetic shielding needed for product to pass FCC and ETSI testing).

3.  I read somewhere else that it was carbon fiber.

4.  Ambroid Proweld (near the bottom of the following link) is listed as
dissolving other types of plastic other than ABS:

******

Regarding repair, after scraping off the failed ABS cement, I repaired it
with 2-part epoxy, and it seemed to work, but I don't want to stress it.  If
I wanted to do a good job, I would try the Ambroid Proweld since Dan says it
has worked for him more than once.
