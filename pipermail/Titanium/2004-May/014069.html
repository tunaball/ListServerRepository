<PRE>I've had about the same experiance as ervyone else on
this list. I've never had a security problem on my
Mac. I've been on the platform since 1992 or so; so
that includes System 7, all the OSes 8, OS 9 as well
as OS X.

I've heard of a few minor problems. The Quicktime
Autostart Worm was one, another was a virus that made
it's way onto a MacAddict CD. They were embaressed but
no harm was done -- somehow the virus had infected a
program that wouldn't run on machines old enough to
run the virus. I'd heard about problems with Macros,
so I used Appleworks. I've also heard of the Trojan
Horse people have mentioned. I can't remember hearing
about anyone having any of these problems outside of
the Mac media. It sounds like your co-workers are
saying viruses the way mechanics say gremlins.

Contrast this with PC users. Talk with a Windows
poweruser for a few minutes and you'll almost always
hear first-hand accounts of viruses deleted, worms
thwarted, and hard-drives reformatted. I've changes
two preferences, and looked real hard at any programs
offered for download. Never had any problems.

Nick
