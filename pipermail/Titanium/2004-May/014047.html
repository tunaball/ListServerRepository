Exactly-- even now that I don't do it any more, I still answer every email
about it I get within 24 hours (advising them NOT to use TiPaint.com)!

Here's how I've gotten best results:

Take your computer to a local paint shop and have them match the paint...
Make sure that you have them put a touch on paper to dry and compare it,
because their matching machine isn't perfect.  It took me about 30-45
minutes in the shop to get mine matched.  Then apply it with a small swab
(looks kind of like a plastic single ended Q-Tip, but the tip is about 1/5th
of the size)-- they should sell these swabs, although you may have to buy
50... They are cheap... ~$5 for a 50 pack.    Then let it dry for an hour,
and, using the finest sandpaper in the store level it down, being very very
careful not to take off any more original paint.  I found I had to do this
about 5 times for the best results.

I haven't done this in about a year and a half, but my white paint is
starting to rub off, so I'm going to try this in a week or so, and I'll let
you guys know if I have any new tips.
