 From the terms anconditions:
&quot;Apple will use reasonable endeavors  to repair covered equipment 
within 14 days of you reporting a fault, but repair may take longer due 
to circumstances beyond Apple's control&quot;
But I agree that might be 'overkill'.

</I>
In my case that's my only computer. since I've sent it for repair I'm 
sharing an iMac with a collegu, but, of course (I'm an heavy computer 
user), he is starting to be annoyed by the situation.
Not to mention that he used to be an hard time PC user, forced to use 
Mac by the environment . And in order to convince him sharing his 
computer, I've been telling how fantastic the Apple service was (I had 
a problem with the keyboard and they've replaced it within 4 days) and 
how I would have the computer back, before he would have even noticed I 
was using his.....

&gt;<i> Your other course of action would be to go to the retailer (was it 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple?) who sold you the Powerbook
</I>
my TiBook is almost three years old... I guess that's not possible 
anymore

I'll try sending an emaiul to Steve....
