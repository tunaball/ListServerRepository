</I>&gt;<i> Not quite. I have a Home Automation program that doesn't work properly in
</I>&gt;<i> Classic. It seems to need an INIT or two to load at startup. It won't load
</I>&gt;<i> in Classic, apparently. It can only be done by booting into OS 9 from
</I>&gt;<i> scratch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To sound like I am beating a dead horse; If they have made it possible to
</I>&gt;<i> boot from scratch into Windows, loading all the resources properly to run
</I>&gt;<i> just about every Windows program available, why not OS 9?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I would like to see is a program that would give the system a 1G or so
</I>&gt;<i> partition to boot OS 9 in such a way that everything you have in the System
</I>&gt;<i> (INITs, Control Panels, Fonts, Sounds, Application Helpers, etc.) is loaded
</I>&gt;<i> properly.

Yes, one could attempt to write a ROM patch.  Since Apple stopped updating
the OS, you need a patch to tell the OS what the new hardware is.  Then you
need to write a firmware updater to rewrite the bootROM to
re-recognize OS 9. 

But the expense to write the patch for every single machine you want to
build OS 9 boot-ability for probably would be a bit high.  Very high since
each and every machine would need this. Then there is warranty issue. Then
there is Apple legal and how does one view propriety over ROM.  I do not
know that.

Probably better to buy a new &quot;legacy&quot; PowerMac G4 for
$1000-$2000  an old TiBook to boot into OS9.

Basically, Apple does not make its new computers backward compatible with
its old  operating systems. With one exception, it has never done so. The
one exception is that Apple continued to develop Macs that were compatible
with MacOS 9 for 2-3 years following the release of MacOS X 10.0. There were
pragmatic reasons for doing so.

I know several folks that have been searching for a solution and there was a
ROM replacement at one point for a new G4 version that would only boot into
OSX that was available only to service techs, but nothing ever materialized
for other Macs or PowerBooks. Zip.  And I understand that they determined
that was no need to create that.  Too expensive.
So I am afraid that no app more than likely will ever be written nor will
Apple create ROM that will work on various Mac models allowing boots into OS
9.
