Thanks. I looked into this particular PowerBook which doesn't stay in QWERTY for long, no matter what. I thought that it was one where I had merely registered it in Dvorak but I was wrong. It was a prior PowerBook that I had used in Dvorak for a while.

The current user of this PowerBook has run about every utility, trashed relevant prefs and has re-installed the system. She may or may not have done a clean install. I can't say because I wasn't watching.

So the default language could have been captured wrongly at any time. I at first thought that the registration let me choose Dvorak and maybe it has ownership of more of the system (or PRAM or NVRAM) than I did later when I made my own selections in the International System Preference.

But this issue of the PowerBook owning things that I should own pops up in other places. For example, I never found a way, over the last 6 months, to set the View Option of my HD folder or my Applications folder or my HD level Library folder and have it hold past a Finder reset or logout or restart. The system has its own mind of what the View Options are for these folders and I must have reset them as I like about 100 times. Well, I just installed all my software freshly and made all my setups freshly on a new PowerBook (also a 17&quot; Al) and it doesn't exhibit this problem.

It's not fit for humans when such unexplainable things happen. Where did our LISA (Macintosh too) dreams go?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Since you are guessing startup seems might be involved, does
</I>&gt;<i>verbose startup give any clues?
</I>
I haven't tried that. But this situation is caused also when the Finder quits and when I run certain installers, mainly Apple ones.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In any case, have you done a (maybe tedious to review results)
</I>&gt;<i>file content search for eg &quot;Dvorak&quot; to see in what plists, etc
</I>&gt;<i>it might show up?  And then try substitute eg &quot;Querty&quot; string
</I>&gt;<i>in any such plists, etc?  Of course the hope is that maybe only
</I>&gt;<i>one such file has the Dvorak setting, and it's referenced only
</I>&gt;<i>occasionally; tho maybe there would be a few such files.  It
</I>&gt;<i>seems unlikely actual kernel would be set to Dvorak--would
</I>&gt;<i>kexts, etc be covered by a search-all-visibility-files search?
</I>&gt;<i>Or package contents?  I haven't checked this now.
</I>
Great idea. I have SNARD so I could also explore system files. Thanks for this suggestion.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The &quot;root-level problem&quot; phrase sounds a little vague, maybe

</I>&gt;<i>ended up talking to someone in AirPort development or some such
</I>&gt;<i>for a technical issue I had.
</I>
I can't say. But I do know that the genius people are NOT told about known problems like the 2 GB RAM being incompatible with AirPort. So I don't expect them to have every answer. I'm really hoping for something like you suggested - looking at the contents of plists for the keyboard type.
