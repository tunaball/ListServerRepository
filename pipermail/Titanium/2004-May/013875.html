<PRE>I read through the logs frighteningly frequently, actually.  ;-)  
Luckily, a lot of the stuff that's in there isn't really an error, it's 
more of a warning.  And a fair amount is often network-related things - 
luckily, TCP handles lost and corrupt packets pretty well, you'd never 
know the difference.  ESPECIALLY nice for me, as there's a lot of 
interference around my wireless connection, including 2.4 GHz phones 
and other wireless access points.  I found that after a day or two, my 
computer and the wireless access point had transmitted about 130 MB of 
duplicate data because of lost packets.  Granted, that was only about 
2% of total network traffic, but still a fairly sizable amount...

Apple Hardware Test spins up the fan much faster than it normally runs 
on recent PowerBooks; I'm not sure if it does this just because the 
fans are capable of going that fast, or because the computer may 
actually tell them to go that fast.  I've seen the same high-speed fan 
operation in AHT myself, but I've never seen my PowerBook (or any other 
AlBook) get that fast anywhere except AHT.  It does certainly sound 
like a 747 warming up its engines though.  I just wish my computer 
would start floating while doing that test, Harrier-style.  ;-)
