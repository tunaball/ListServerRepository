<PRE>i agree with what Matthew Fossberg says.
You don't have a trojan on your mac - thats for sure ... what happened 
is, that someone spoofed your email address ... that means, he pretends 
to be you and sends emails in your name. Since he is using 
(theoretically) your email account the bounced messages come back to 
you. This method is often used by spammers and massmailers - you have 
become a victim of this.
I don't really know what else you could do, other than change your 
email address that has been hacked. For your future email address you 
can take precautions, such as:
- don't mention it like '<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">johnedwards at earthbound.net</A>' on your homepage - 
instead use sth. like a little script or picture (this way email spider 
apps fail to catch it through your page)
- have one email account for family and one for business matters
a.s.o. .... i have 4 email accounts - still get about 5 spam mails per 
day, but they are filtered by mail.app ....
same thing happened to my wifes email account ... actually we realized 
it, because she sent a virus to my mac (from her pc, hotmail account) 
... well and that was very unlikely that it actually was her =)

anyways, i guess this is what you have to do .... maybe someone else 
has an idea ... and also ask your ISP (the beepbeep i guess) about this 
phenomenon, they will know what you mean.
