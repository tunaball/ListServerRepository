An interesting question.

I don't have the answer but this would be my suggestion:

I would look at the terms and conditions of the Applecare in detail and 
see what they are (perhaps this may exempt them from any particular 
time-frame or deadline) but even if they are restrictive, the term 
&quot;reasonable&quot; features heavily in common-law judicial systems (e.g. UK, 
USA, Canada) ... but litigation might be &quot;overkill&quot; for one Powerbook.

FYI: Applecare Europe kept my Powerbook for five weeks, while they 
&quot;waited&quot; for parts to fix my dead Firewire port.

It wasn't the end of the world for me as I had moved all my data on to 
an iMac I owned at the time and worked on that, but with a single 
machine it would be problematic.

Your other course of action would be to go to the retailer (was it 
Apple?) who sold you the Powerbook, but you need to do this before you 
invoke the Applecare fix. I did this a couple of times with a very 
reputable dealer in the UK who just replaced my Powerbook when it had 
major hardware faults (screen dead) after their engineers confirmed (24 
hours) that there was a problem covered under warranty. Again the T&amp;C 
of the retailer becomes important here, as well as your relationship 
with them.

My gut instinct is once Applecare have your machine they can spend 
&quot;reasonable&quot; time fixing the thing. I called Applecare and spoke to 
employees based in Germany (the repair centre) a couple of times for 
status updates.

Any lawyers in the house?
