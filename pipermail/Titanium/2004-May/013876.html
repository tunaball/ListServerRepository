<PRE>Hi Kynan,

I realised that unfortunately, I am a victim  of both dark and light pixels.
Will be down to Apple Care tomorrow to make my claims.

Thanks for the explanation.  But like all die-hard users, we like our
screens to be perfect even if the body is all spotted(Ti) and
discolored(Pismo).

Cheers,
Lee

&gt;<i> I agree, it's probably unlikely that the location of manufacture has
</I>&gt;<i> anything to do with it.  However, a couple bad pixels is certainly
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable on something as complex and bounded by such tight tolerances
</I>&gt;<i> as an LCD panel is.  Most of them are certainly perfect, but it would
</I>&gt;<i> double the cost of an LCD to guarantee a perfect screen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's a quick note on why pixels get stuck; in general, it's because a
</I>&gt;<i> transistor in the screen is broken somehow.  Maybe it's stuck on (dark
</I>&gt;<i> pixel) or off (light pixel) - perhaps one of its connections is just a
</I>&gt;<i> little loose.  No way you'd fix that one transistor though; if you
</I>&gt;<i> reject one pixel, the whole display is trash.  The reason?  The
</I>&gt;<i> location of that transistor: I'll give you a hint as to where it is
</I>&gt;<i> located: you're looking right through it!  There is a transistor for
</I>&gt;<i> every sub-pixel on your screen (there are 3 sub-pixels per pixel, one
</I>&gt;<i> each for red, green, and blue).  There is also at least one capacitor.
</I>&gt;<i> All of these tiny components are so thin (just a few atomic layers
</I>&gt;<i> thin!) that you can see right through them.  So, on a 1024x768 LCD,
</I>&gt;<i> there are 2,359,296 transistors.  On the 23&quot; cinema display, there are
</I>&gt;<i> 6,912,000 (1920*1200*3).  Yours (a 15&quot;, I presume?) has 3,279,360
</I>&gt;<i> transistors in the surface of the screen.  That would mean that there
</I>&gt;<i> was a manufacturing defect rate of 0.00006%.  I bet most industries
</I>&gt;<i> would LOVE their production techniques to provide such amazing results!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, it's too bad you have a pixel, but unfortunately, we have to
</I>&gt;<i> wait for technology to slowly progress to get fewer dead pixels; and
</I>&gt;<i> it's probably more likely that consumers will choose more advanced
</I>&gt;<i> displays over ones that are less likely to get dead pixels, so they'll
</I>&gt;<i> probably continue to have dead pixel issues until there is a major
</I>&gt;<i> change in flat panel technology.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On a side note, a few retailers might let you return your computer for
</I>&gt;<i> bad pixels, or inspect a computer's display before you buy it.  I know
</I>&gt;<i> that the reseller at my campus (sorry, university customers only!) does
</I>&gt;<i> this sometimes; many won't, however, because Apple won't repair the
</I>&gt;<i> display for only one or two bad pixels.  So, they just end up selling
</I>&gt;<i> the computer as a customer return (and note the bad pixel, and the
</I>&gt;<i> less-than-1-year warranty) for a few hundred dollars less, and eat the
</I>&gt;<i> difference in price.
