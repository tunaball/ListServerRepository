<PRE>On Mon, May 03, 2004, the following words from Steve Martin
<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/titanium.html">stevemartin at mac.com</A>, emerged from a plethora of SPAM ...

&gt;<i>When you are giving your presentation, are you looking at the PowerBook 
</I>&gt;<i>screen or the presentation display.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you don't need to see the PowerBook screen just turn the brightness 
</I>&gt;<i>all the way down until the display backlight goes off.  That will stop 
</I>&gt;<i>the Apple from glowing.

Sometimes the bright Apple logo is a good thing.

I recently worked in a local community college in an office that had a
computer &quot;expert&quot; in between all the users and the IT department who was
vocally very anti-Mac. When I bought my new PowerBook, the first words
from the &quot;expert&quot; was &quot;Why didn't you get a REAL computer? Nobody uses an
Apple for REAL work.&quot; A few days later, we were sitting at the back of a
very large auditorium listening to a speaker from a government agency in
Washington D.C. The moment I saw the glowing Apple logo from the back of
the laptop just set up for the presentation, I was going to say
something, but decided to keep quiet until a break in the presentation.
The computer expert nudged me a few moments later because she was
wondering what the presentation software was that was used by the
presenter. She was very impressed with the quality of the presentation. I
had to bite my tongue for a few seconds before nudging the &quot;expert&quot; and
replying, &quot;Look! That's an Apple logo. They are using an Apple PowerBook
just like mine!&quot; The &quot;expert&quot; didn't believe me because she thought I was
just seeing Apple's everywhere. So, as the presentation ended, I made her
walk up to the stage with me to verify that it was indeed an Apple
computer before they put all the equipment away. It was at least a month
before I could look the computer expert in the face without forcing
myself to refrain from laughing out loud because she said &quot;I guess I was
wrong. Apples can be used for REAL work.&quot; She never changed her anti-Mac
stance for the office, but it was nice having her admit she was wrong
about Macs.

So, I'm really glad the Apple logo can be seen, even if a bit distracting. :-)
