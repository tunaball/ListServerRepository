<PRE>Hi Mickey,

&gt;<i>  I have the Mac as my network hub...
</I>
By this, I assume that you mean you get a net connection when your Mac 
is plugged into the hub/switch or router, and not that the Mac IS the 
hub.  Is that correct?

&gt;<i> According to the docs for my system it is supposed to have the airport 
</I>&gt;<i> card.
</I>
Click on the Apple in the menu bar.  Choose &quot;About this Mac&quot;.  Click 
the &quot;More Info...&quot; button.  When System Profiler comes up, click on the 
Airport Card item under the Hardware category.  If this is not listed, 
then you don't have one.  If you do, check the Wireless Channel number 
and make sure it agrees with the router.  In most cases it will be 
channel 11.

I have a Belkin F5D7230-4 router with firmware 4.03.03.  My TiBook is a 
500MHz with the stock Airport card (802.11b) firmware version  9.52.  I 
had the net set up with my wife's Compaq before I got a Mac, and it was 
using 802.11g so when I added mine, I had to set the router to work 
with &quot;b&quot; and &quot;g&quot; networks.  I had previously had it set to use strictly 
&quot;g&quot; for better net performance.

If System Profiler says yours is an Airport Extreme, then you can use 
&quot;g&quot; otherwise you must use &quot;b&quot;.  If you must use &quot;b&quot; and the Dell can 
use &quot;g&quot; then verify that your router is set to work on both.  The 
setting (on mine at least) is at <A HREF="http://192.168.2.1/wireless_chan.html">http://192.168.2.1/wireless_chan.html</A> 
(substitute your router's IP address, if different).

Also make sure the encryption settings are compatible.  Are you 
broadcasting your SSID?  This will make it easier to establish a 
connection.  I use WPA-PSK, TKIP but I needed to upgrade the firmware 
in the router and get the latest Airport drivers to use it.  If either 
your Mac or the router won't support WPA (and if it cannot be upgraded) 
then make sure both are using at least WEP.

Also, check that the router is not restricted to connections from 
certain MAC addresses.  Restricting MACs and hiding the SSID provide 
only marginal extra security for most networks, but significantly 
increases the fuss in connecting a new machine.

Go grab a copy of iStumbler at <A HREF="http://www.istumbler.net/">http://www.istumbler.net/</A>   This is a 
donate-ware wireless LAN diagnostic program that can help you find 
WLANS and also help sort out Bluetooth communications problems.  It is 
quite handy.

Cheers,

Scott
